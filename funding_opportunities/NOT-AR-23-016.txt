march 3, 2023pa-20-272 - administrative supplements to existing nih grants and cooperative agreements (parent admin supp clinical trial optional)not-ar-23-015 - notice of special interest (nosi): availability of urgent competitive revisions to add or expand research and administrative supplements on cutting edge pain research in rheumatic, skin, and musculoskeletal disease.national institute of arthritis and musculoskeletal and skin diseases (niams)the niams is interested in supporting increased opportunities for training focused on the study of the mechanisms, measurement, and/or treatment of pain within existing niams t32 training grants with the goal of developing a diverse research workforce that has the skills and context expertise needed to address the existing gaps in these areas. many of the diseases covered by the niams mission areas cause pain; and pain, both acute and chronic, is one of the most important symptoms affecting mobility and quality of life for patients. yet, the mechanisms of pain; outcome measures, biomarkers, and treatment options that can prevent and alleviate pain; and measures that can improve health equity of all populations suffering from pain caused by these diseases remain critical knowledge gaps.through this announcement, niams is soliciting administrative supplements to existing t32 programs to add either or both of the following:training curriculumapplicants interested in adding new curricular or training activities should propose creative educational activities that will allow trainees to gain the knowledge and experience necessary to integrate the study of pain into their research careers. these activities could include development of new curriculum, training events, or other education opportunities. in all cases, priority will be given to applicants that propose to develop new educational activities that are designed to be shared freely with the broader scientific community. towards that end, curriculum designed with exportable training modules are particularly encouraged.additional traineeapplicants interested in adding an additional trainee to their existing t32 program should identify a candidate that is, or will begin training with one of the existing preceptors/mentors associated with the t32 program and is conducting a research project that is both within the scope of the t32 program and is focused on the mechanisms, measurement, and/or treatment of pain. trainees that have already been appointed to the t32 award are not eligible for support via this supplement. the trainee should be committed to pursuing a career as a pain researcher with the niams mission and the preceptor/mentor should work with the trainee to develop a training plan that will help the trainee achieve that goal.participation in annual national pain scientists career development program meeting (r24)the heal r24 coordinating center for national pain scientists is developing a network of early-career pain scientists, pain trainees, and mentors (rfa-ns-22-060). the heal r24 coordinating center for national pain scientists has named their program “positively uniting researchers of pain to opine, synthesize, and engage (purpose)” https://painresearchers.com/. the coordinating center aims to improve collaboration between basic, translational, and clinical researchers, who do not regularly collaborate or work together. one function of this coordination center is to organize an annual meeting for established scientists as well as early career pain investigators. this meeting will facilitate the development of a network of pain research mentors and mentees, foster communication between scientists and clinicians of different disciplines, provide enhanced mentorship, leadership courses, and any additional training for early-career scientists. the t32 trainee will be required to attend the annual heal r24 annual national pain scientist career development meeting. the t32 awards should provide financial support for the trainee and their mentors to attend this annual meeting. t32 grant applicants can propose up to $1,500 for travel costs for those people attending the annual meeting. in addition, t32 trainees and mentors are encouraged to participate in all other aspects of the heal r24 coordinating centers for national pain scientists program, including networking experiences and classes.eligibilitythe parent t32 award must have a project end date of april 1, 2025 or later. awards in a no-cost extension (nce) are not eligible.application and submission informationapplications for this initiative must be within scope of the parent award and must be submitted using the following opportunity or its subsequent reissued equivalent.all instructions in the sf424 (r&r) application guide and the funding opportunity announcement used for submission must be followed, with the following additions:training curriculumadditional traineeplease direct all inquiries to:rebecca lenzi, ph.dnational institute of arthritis and musculoskeletal and skin diseasestelephone: 301-402-2446email: niams_pain@mail.nih.govweekly toc for this announcement nih funding opportunities and noticesnote: for help accessing pdf, rtf, ms word, excel, powerpoint, audio or video files, see help downloading files.
