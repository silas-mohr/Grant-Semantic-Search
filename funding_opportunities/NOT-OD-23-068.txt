https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-23-068.html
january 30, 2023rfa-od-23-001: animal and biological material resource centers (p40)division of program coordination, planning and strategic initiatives, office of research infrastructure programs (orip)animal and biological material resource centers provide support for special colonies of laboratory animals, as well as other resources such as informatics tools, reagents, biological materials (cells, tissues, and organs) and genetic stocks that serve the biomedical research community in a variety of research areas on a local, regional, and national basis. the division of program coordination, planning and strategic initiatives, orip encourages current centers supported by p40 grants awarded under rfa-od-20-002 or par-17-006 that have not yet applied for a p40 competitive renewal application under rfa-od-23-001 to submit a revision application to add a curation and informatics component to existing animal and biological material resource centers (p40) as a curation and informatics component is a requirement in rfa-od-23-001. the supplement will provide support to currently funded centers for a curation and informatics component to develop and maintain in-house data management systems, curate stocks of animals and biomaterials, and maintain a searchable web portal with an integrated community-friendly request/ordering system and outreach presentations.backgroundthe goal of projects submitted under this nosi is to provide support for a curation and informatics component which will generate or assist the generation of new information, services, products, and/or models that will improve the resource center. animal and biological material resource centers supported by the p40 grant mechanism must have broad application to multiple nih institutes or centers (ics) to align with the orip’s nih-wide mission (https://orip.nih.gov/about-orip).important functions of animal and biological material resource centers are developing and maintaining the center’s in-house data management systems in a format that may facilitate their integration with other animal resource databases and community standards for information accessibility and interoperability, as well as providing adequate staff for curation of newly acquired stocks for collection and animal resource distribution management. these activities will contribute to the implementation of the nih strategic plan for data science, which describes actions aimed at modernizing the biomedical research data ecosystem. biomedical repositories should accept submission of relevant data from the community and generate their own data to store, organize, validate, archive, preserve, and distribute information in compliance with the fair (findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable) data principles. centers should develop plans in accordance with the new nih policy for data management and sharing (not-od-22-189) to better position such centers for the data implementation update requirements. in addition, improving access to the resource center’s databases as well as developing metrics to evaluate the usage, utility, and impact of a given repository will improve the ability of these centers to meet the needs of the biomedical research community.specific areas of research interest and submission requirementsthe research plan for the curation and informatics component must discuss the following key areas:the curation of repository stocks and generation of associations with genomic and phenotyping information to improve cross-referencing and integration of the animal models available from other orip supported resources (where applicable). development of systems that allow animal strain, related biological materials, and reagent (e.g., antibody) to be searched according to model phenotype and reagent properties (e.g., the species in which reagent performance has been validated).use of industry standard information management practices according to the fair data principles, alignment of existing data repositories with trust (transparency, responsibility, user focus, sustainability, and technology) principles, and evaluation of usage, utility, and impact.development of web content as well as organization of web-based presentation/outreach efforts and community-friendly ordering and order management systems. centers are encouraged to develop interfaces that assist investigators to search repository content for human disease associations.organization of efforts to collect information for center’s reporting purposes (research performance progress reports [rpprs and supplement rpprs] for example) and for evaluating impact of distribution activities and providing services to the biomedical community (i.e., tracking user information, associated funding sources and award numbers, outcomes of the studies using center’s research resources, etc.).comment on training stock center curators with new informatics management skills, and technical personnel with web page development and informatics system maintenance skills.eligibilityin addition to the requirements listed in rfa-od-23-001 note the
