march 2, 2023pa-20-272 - administrative supplements to existing nih grants and cooperative agreements (parent admin supp clinical trial optional)national cancer institute (nci)the goal of this notice of special interest (nosi) from the national cancer institute (nci) is to encourage currently funded nci extramural investigators to apply for administrative supplements to better understand the effects of digital health tools and interventions on patient-provider communication across the cancer control continuum, with the aim of developing an evidence base to inform future development, modification, and delivery of digital tools/interventions for effective cancer prevention and control.this administrative supplement would provide currently funded nci extramural investigators with funding for one year to analyze existing data collected under the parent grant related to (1) the effects of digital health tools/interventions on patient-provider communication and (2) how patient-provider communication influences the relationships between digital health tools/interventions and cancer prevention and control outcomes assessed in the parent grant. knowledge gained from this administrative supplement is intended to inform future development, modification, and delivery of digital tools/interventions to improve cancer outcomes, including patient safety and care quality, healthy behavior, health equity, and health outcomes.for this notice, digital health refers to a wide range of tools and technologies that can be used to support cancer prevention and control, including online and web-based interventions, mobile health, wearables, voice assistants and virtual agents, electronic health records, patient portals, and telehealth, as well as the infrastructure that enables integration, and analysis, and interpretation of data from these technologies. digital tools/interventions may be intended for clinical, public health, home, or community settings and span the cancer control continuum. healthcare providers are broadly defined as any health professionals providing cancer-related care; examples include, but are not limited to, physicians, physician assistants, registered nurses, pharmacists, clinical social workers, behavioral health care providers, and patient navigators. patient-provider communication includes the frequency and quality of communication and associated aspects of the patient-provider relationship, such as trust, satisfaction, patient-centeredness, rapport, language accessibility, affective processes, information processing, shared decision-making, stigma, and empowerment. the cancer control continuum describes the various stages of cancer care including cancer etiology, prevention, screening, detection, diagnosis, treatment, survivorship, and end of life.effective patient-provider communication remains a critical component of cancer prevention and control efforts, with high quality communication associated with better care quality and delivery, patient safety, and adherence to provider treatment and medication recommendations, among other cancer outcomes. the use of digital health has far-reaching implications for individual and population health, including fundamental changes to how, when, and where patients and providers interact. many digital tools have the potential to facilitate patient-provider communication. for example, telehealth and secure messaging through patient portals have been shown to increase cancer patientsâ€™ access to healthcare providers, and wearable technologies may facilitate real-time monitoring and information-sharing about cancer-related health behaviors, symptoms, and treatment effects. however, digital tools and interventions may also have unintended negative consequences such as shortened appointments, missed non-verbal cues, widened digital divide, financial burden, provider burnout, or interference in relationship building. without attention to the overall impact of digital health for patient-provider communication, these tools/interventions may fail to achieve their cancer control and prevention objectives or result in unintended harm.the relationships between digital health tools/interventions, patient-provider communication, and subsequent cancer outcomes are especially understudied among historically underserved populations, which include minoritized racial and ethnic groups, socioeconomically disadvantaged populations, rural populations, lgbtq+ individuals, older adults, and individuals living with behavioral health conditions or physical disabilities. members of many of these groups have lower access to and engagement with digital tools compared with the general u.s. population, and also tend to experience poorer quality communication with their healthcare providers. in this context, digital health tools risk exacerbating existing cancer disparities if they further degrade the quality of communication and relationships. yet, digital tools also have the potential to ameliorate access to care and service disparities and improve patient-provider communication if developed and deployed with equity in mind.to maximize benefits and minimize risks of digital health, research must explicitly consider how digital tools/interventions affect patient-provider communication, and how patient-provider communication in turn influences the relationships between digital health interventions and the cancer outcomes they intend to improve.this administrative supplement allows currently funded nci extramural investigators to examine the effects of digital tools/interventions on patient-provider communication and/or how patient-provider communication influences the relationships between digital tools/interventions and cancer-related outcomes of interest to the parent study. applicants may propose to supplement parent awards that are focused on the development, testing, or delivery of digital health tools/interventions or to explore digital health-related barriers or opportunities in their patient-provider communication focused research.specific research priorities may include, but are not limited to, the following:administrative supplement applications focusing on under-resourced settings and underserved populations served by the parent award, which include blacks/african americans, hispanics/latinos, american indians/alaska natives, asian americans, native hawaiians and other pacific islanders, socioeconomically disadvantaged populations, rural populations, lgbtq+ individuals, individuals living with behavioral health conditions or physical disabilities, and older adult populations, are of particular interest.applications for this initiative must be submitted using the following opportunity or its subsequent reissued equivalent.all instructions in the sf424 (r&r) application guide and pa-20-272
