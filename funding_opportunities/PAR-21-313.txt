iii. 3. additional information on eligibility.the purpose of this funding opportunity announcement (foa) is to provide support for new investigators from diverse backgrounds, including from groups nationally underrepresented in biomedical, clinical, behavioral and social sciences research, to conduct small research projects in the scientific mission areas of the national institute of diabetes and digestive and kidney diseases (niddk) , the national human genome research institute (nhgri) or the national institute of biomedical imaging and bioengineering (nibib). new investigators at the time of award under this foa will have had less than $125,000 direct costs of combined research funding (excluding nih training and nih career awards). this r21 will support small research projects that can be carried out in a short period of time with limited resources and seeks to facilitate transition to research independence. the r21 grant mechanism supports different types of projects including pilot and feasibility studies; secondary analysis of existing data; small, self-contained research projects; development of research methodology; and development of new research technology.not applicableall applications are due by 5:00 pm local time of applicant organization. all types of non-aids applications allowed for this funding opportunity announcement are due on the

is critical that applicants follow the instructions in the research (r) instructions in the sf424 (r&r) application guide, except where instructed to do otherwise (in this foa or in a notice from nih guide for grants and contracts).conformance to all requirements (both in the application guide and the foa) is required and strictly enforced. applicants must read and follow all application instructions in the application guide as well as any program-specific instructions noted in section iv. when the program-specific instructions deviate from those in the application guide, follow the program-specific instructions.applications that do not comply with these instructions may be delayed or not accepted for review.there are several options available to submit your application through grants.gov to nih and department of health and human services partners. you must use one of these submission options to access the application forms for this opportunity.background informationthe national institutes of health (nih) recognizes the need to diversify the scientific workforce by enhancing the participation of individuals from groups identified as underrepresented in the biomedical, clinical, behavioral and social sciences (collectively termed "biomedical") research workforce. diversity at all levels — from the kinds of science to the regions in which it is conducted to the backgrounds of the people conducting it — contributes to excellence in research training environments and strengthens the research enterprise. research shows that diverse teams working together and capitalizing on innovative ideas and distinct perspectives outperform homogenous teams. scientists and trainees from diverse backgrounds and life experiences bring different perspectives, creativity, and individual interests to address complex scientific problems. there are many benefits that flow from a diverse nih-supported scientific workforce, including fostering scientific innovation, enhancing global competitiveness, contributing to robust learning environments, improving the quality of research, enhancing public trust, and increasing the likelihood that health disparities and the needs of underserved populations are addressed in biomedical research.purpose and need for the programthis foa is intended to provide support for new investigators from diverse backgrounds, including those from groups that are nationally underrepresented in the biomedical sciences, who are interested in conducting research projects within the scientific mission areas of the niddk the nhgri or the nibib. the goal of this foa is to enable a pool of investigators from diverse backgrounds to submit subsequent r01 or equivalent applications through the support of these small research grants, as well as receive additional independent research grant awards, produce research results, and author publications.the nih recognizes that the entry of new investigators into the ranks of independent, nih-funded researchers is essential to improving the overall capacity of this country's biomedical research enterprise. while scientific workforce diversity supports the nih mission, expanding the pool of investigators from nationally underrepresented backgrounds in the biomedical research workforce remains an elusive goal. even with long-standing congressional support for early research independence, nih funding, and government-wide efforts to promote stem workforce diversity, early career scientists find it increasingly difficult to obtain support for a first research award, and retain that support in subsequent years. see, policy supporting the next generation researchers initiative, https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/not-od-17-101.html.as a result, the nih and the participating components of the organization are committed to the research support of new investigators. this program will enable new investigators to gain additional research experience and obtain preliminary data on which to base a subsequent research grant application (i.e., r01 or equivalent) within the scientific mission areas of the niddk the nhgri or the nibib.although the united states has seen a significant increase in the number of ph.d. degrees in the biomedical sciences earned by scientists from historically underrepresented racial and ethnic groups in the biomedical research workforce, a corresponding increase in the ranks of the faculty in basic science departments has not occurred (gibbs et al., elife 2016; valantine et al., cbe-life sciences education, 2016). in addition, disparities in nih grant funding still persist among underrepresented racial and ethnic groups (ginther et al., science, 2011; hoppe et al., 2019; erosheva et al., 2020). a recent nih report examined the number of investigators funded by the nih during fiscal years (fy) 2016-2020 and showed that only 2.4% of research grants were awarded to black or african american investigators while 66.2% of research grants were awarded to white investigators. with respect to ethnicity, 4.8% of research grants were awarded to hispanic investigators during fy2016-2020. as a way of addressing these disparities in funding, this foa provides up to three years of funds for applicants from diverse backgrounds to generate preliminary data which can support subsequent research grant applications.specific areas of research interestnibib : nibib interests include the development and integration of advanced bioengineering, sensing, imaging, and computational technologies for the improvement of human health and medical care. an application is not within the nibib mission if its principal focus is the development of a technology with the goal of understanding basic biological function or pathological mechanisms. additionally, nibib only supports projects developing platform technologies that are applicable to a broad spectrum of disorders and diseases. however, applicants may propose research that utilizes only a single tissue, organ, or physiological condition as a model system to facilitate the development of what is expected to be a more broadly applicable enabling technology. potential applicants are encouraged to contact the nibib scientific/research contact in section vii. agency contacts to determine if their research fits within the nibib mission.nibib funding of clinical trials will be in accordance with not-eb-21-005 "nibib guidance for support of clinical trial applications." briefly, nibib will only support mission-focused (see nibib's program areas) early-stage clinical trial applications, i.e., feasibility, phase i, first-in-human, safety, or other small clinical trials, that inform early stage technology development. nibib will not support applications proposing pivotal, phase ii, iii, iv, or trials in which the primary outcome is efficacy, effectiveness, or a post-market concern. also, mechanistic trials are not supported unless the primary focus of the project is on technology development.niddk: the niddk's mission is to conduct and support medical research and research training and to disseminate science-based information on diabetes and other endocrine and metabolic diseases; digestive diseases, nutritional disorders and obesity; and kidney, urologic, and hematologic diseases, to improve people’s health and quality of life. this funding opportunity seeks to facilitate the transition to research independence of new investigators from diverse backgrounds, including from groups underrepresented in the biomedical sciences, who are knowledgeable about these diseases within the scope of the niddk mission and available to focus on these diseases in their research careers.nhgri: the nhgri supports the development of resources, approaches, and technologies that accelerate and support studies focused on the structure and biology of genomes; the genomics of disease; the implementation and effectiveness of genomic medicine; genomic data science and bioinformatics; training, developing, and expanding the diversity of the genomics workforce; and ethical, legal, and social issues related to genomic advances. more details about the institute’s vision and priority areas can be found in the 2020 nhgri strategic vision (https://www.genome.gov/2020sv).this foa will only support research within the mission of the niddk the nhgri or the nibib.programmatic approachto minimize the loss of competitive investigators from diverse backgrounds, and to promote successful transitions to established investigator levels, it is imperative to provide funding opportunities to support investigators actively conducting research studies but without substantial preliminary data for them to be fully competitive at the r01 levels in all areas of interest to the niddk, the nhgri or the nibib.the niddk will monitor the implementation of this program to determine its impact on individual awardees and their successful transition to research independence.applications not responsive to this foaapplications that do not reflect the areas of research interest specified above will not be considered responsive to this foa. applications that do not address how the results of the proposed research will be translated to further r01 or equivalent applications or independent research awards will not be considered responsive. non-responsive applications submitted to this foa will be withdrawn without review.see section viii. other information for award authorities and regulations.grant: a support mechanism providing money, property, or both to an eligible entity to carry out an approved project or activity.the oer glossary and the sf424 (r&r)

either create a new account or to affiliate their existing account with the applicant organization in era commons. if the pd/pi is also the organizational signing official, they must have two distinct era commons accounts, one for each role. obtaining an era commons account can take up to 2 weeks.any individual(s) with the skills, knowledge, and resources necessary to carry out the proposed research as the program director(s)/principal investigator(s) (pd(s)/pi(s)) is invited to work with his/her organization to develop an application for support. individuals from underrepresented racial and ethnic groups as well as individuals with disabilities are always encouraged to apply for nih support.for institutions/organizations proposing multiple pds/pis, visit the multiple program director/principal investigator policy and submission details in the senior/key person profile (expanded) component of the sf424 (r&r) application guide.individuals applying as the pd/pi must meet each eligibility criterion below. for a multiple pd/pi application, all the individuals serving as pds/pis are required to meet all of the same eligibility criteria as for a single pd/pi application.eligible health professional or doctoral degreesprogram directors /principal investigators (pds/pis) must have a clinical or research doctorate (including phd, md, do, dc, nd, dds, dmd, dvm, scd, dns, pharmd or equivalent doctoral degrees). it is recommended that applicants should have completed a postdoctoral research experience which lasted a minimum of two years at the time of application. as jointly defined by the nih and the national science foundation (nsf), a postdoctoral scholar is (available at: https://grants.nih.gov/training/reed_letter.pdf): "an individual who has received a doctoral degree (or equivalent) and is engaged in a temporary and defined period of mentored advanced training to enhance the professional skills and research independence needed to pursue his or her chosen career path." however, completion of a postdoctoral research experience is not required for an applicant to apply as a pd/pi to this foa.citizenship requirementsby the time of award, the individual must be a citizen or a non-citizen national of the united states or have been lawfully admitted for permanent residence (i.e., possess a currently valid permanent resident card uscis form i-551, or other legal verification of such status). individuals on temporary or student visas are not eligible.new investigatorsfor the purposes of this foa, an investigator is considered a new investigator if he/she has not competed successfully as pd/pi for a substantialnih independent research award. pds/pis of nih training-related and mentored career awards are eligible for this foa if the nih awards are in any of the following categories: fellowships (f awards), individual or institutional career awards (k awards), loan repayment contracts (l30, l32, l40, l50, l60), and all training grants (t32, t34, t35, t90, d43). pds/pis with r00 awards are not eligible.a pd/pi who has been awarded by the time of award for this foa research funds from all combined grant or award sources (including non-nih grants) and combined award years as pd/pi at the time of award that is (1) greater than or equal to $125,000 in direct costs and (2) the award(s) is/are for longer than one year in duration in combined time is not eligible for this r21 award. this funding limitation does not include nih training grants or nih mentored career development awards.finally, a new investigator who is considered a postdoctoral candidate or is in a postdoctoral position at the time of application is not eligible to apply as the pd/pi to this foa.enhancing diversitythe overarching goal of this program is to enhance the diversity of independent investigators conducting research within the mission of niddk or the participating ics. fostering diversity by addressing underrepresentation in the scientific research workforce is a key component of the niddk and nih strategy to identify, develop, support, and maintain the quality of our scientific human capital. despite tremendous advancements in scientific research, information, educational and research opportunities are not equally available to all. nih encourages institutions to diversify their student, postdoctoral, and faculty populations to enhance the participation of individuals from groups identified as underrepresented in the biomedical sciences (e.g., see the notice of nih's of interest in diversity).for the purposes of this foa, individuals from diverse backgrounds, including groups that are underrepresented in the biomedical sciences are encouraged to apply as pd/pi.this foa does not require cost sharing as defined in the nih grants policy statement.number of applicationsapplicant organizations may submit more than one application, provided that each application is scientifically distinct.the nih will

particular announcement, note the following:the r21 exploratory/developmental grant supports investigation of novel scientific ideas or new model systems, tools, or technologies that have the potential for significant impact on biomedical or biobehavioral research. an r21 grant application need not have extensive background material or preliminary information. accordingly, reviewers will emphasize the conceptual framework, the level of innovation, and the potential to significantly advance our knowledge or understanding. appropriate justification for the proposed work can be provided through literature citations, data from other sources, or, when available, from investigator-generated data. preliminary data are not required for r21 applications; however, they may be included if available.in addition, for applications involving clinical trials: a proposed clinical trial application may include study design, methods, and intervention that are not by themselves innovative but address important questions or unmet needs. additionally, the results of the clinical trial may indicate that further clinical development of the intervention is unwarranted or lead to new avenues of scientific investigation.reviewers will provide an overall impact score to reflect their assessment of the likelihood for the project to exert a sustained, powerful influence on the research field(s) involved, in consideration of the following review criteria and additional review criteria (as applicable for the project proposed).reviewers will consider each of the review criteria below in the
