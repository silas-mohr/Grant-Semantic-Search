eligibility.nimhd invites applications to support short-term exploratory or developmental research projects that have the potential to break new ground in the fields of minority health and/or health disparities or extend previous discoveries toward new directions or applications that can directly contribute to improving minority health and/or reducing health disparities in the u.s.not applicableall applications are due by 5:00 pm local time of applicant organization.applicants are encouraged to apply early to allow adequate time to make any corrections to errors found in the application during the submission process by the due date.not applicableit is critical that applicants follow the instructions in the research (r) instructions in the sf424 (r&r) application guide, except where instructed to do otherwise (in this foa or in a notice from nih guide for grants and contracts).conformance to all requirements (both in the application guide and the foa) is required and strictly enforced. applicants must read and follow all application instructions in the application guide as well as any program-specific instructions noted in section iv. when the program-specific instructions deviate from those in the application guide, follow the program-specific instructions.applications that do not comply with these instructions may be delayed or not accepted for review.there are several options available to submit your application through grants.gov to nih and department of health and human services partners. you must use one of these submission options to access the application forms for this opportunity.purposewhile scientific and technological discoveries have improved the health of the u.s. population overall, many populations, including racial/ethnic minorities and other disadvantaged groups, continue to bear disproportionate burdens of disease and adverse health conditions. the purpose of this foa is to encourage new exploratory or developmental research projects that have the potential to break new ground in the fields of minority health and health disparities or extend previous discoveries toward new directions or applications that can directly contribute to improving minority health or reducing health disparities. long-term projects or projects designed to incrementally increase knowledge in a well-established area are not appropriate for this foa.consistent with the exploratory and/or developmental nature of research projects envisioned under this foa, applications are not expected to include and are strongly encouraged to not include preliminary data. projects led by nih-defined early-stage investigators (esi) are particularly encouraged. such projects should exhibit strong potential to position the esis to compete successfully for r01 funding in the near future. investigators, whether established or early stage, who have supportive preliminary data are strongly encouraged to consider applying through a relevant r01 foa instead of this foa.research objectivesprojects are expected to focus on human and population-based studies in the biomedical, clinical, population, behavioral or social sciences. this can include research with human participants, in vitro studies that utilize human tissues to investigate mechanisms underlying resilience or susceptibility to disease, observational studies, epidemiologic studies, patient outcomes research, intervention research, dissemination and implementation research, and health services research. animal studies will not be supported under this foa.projects must include a focus on one or more nih-designated health disparity populations in the us, which include blacks or african americans, hispanics or latinos, american indians and alaska natives, asians, native hawaiians and other pacific islanders, socioeconomically disadvantaged populations, underserved rural populations, and sexual and gender minorities (sgm). comparison groups may be included as appropriate for the research question(s) posed. populations outside the us may be included if the purpose is to inform understanding of the health of immigrants in the us who belong to designated health disparity populations.nimhd has organized its extramural scientific programs around three broad research interest areas: 1) clinical and health services research, 2) community health and population sciences, and 3) integrative biological and behavioral sciences. the clinical and health services research area supports clinical research focused on improving patient health care outcomes and the quality of healthcare services for health disparity populations. the community health and population sciences area supports research on interpersonal, family, neighborhood, community and societal-level mechanisms and pathways that influence disease risk, resilience, morbidity, and mortality in health disparity populations. the integrative biological and behavioral sciences area supports research examining how human biological and behavioral mechanisms and pathways acting at the individual and interpersonal levels influence resilience and susceptibility to adverse health conditions that disproportionately affect health disparity populations. for details about these research areas please visit https://www.nimhd.nih.gov/programs/extramural/research-areas/.projects are expected to use multidisciplinary approaches encompassing multiple domains of influence (e.g., biological, behavioral, socio-cultural, environmental, physical environment, health system) and multiple levels of influence (e.g., individual, interpersonal, community, societal) to understand and address minority health and health disparities (see the nimhd research framework, https://www.nimhd.nih.gov/about/overview/research-framework.html, for more information).projects are expected to fall into one of three broad categories:secondary analysis of existing data. projects in this category are expected to use quantitative analytic approaches. quantitative data analysis may be supplemented or complemented with qualitative data collection as appropriate for the research questions posed. secondary data sources may include but are not limited to the following:development and application of novel research measures, methodologies or analytic approaches. projects in this category are expected to offer innovative, multidisciplinary research approaches to advance the science of minority health and health disparities. potential topics include but are not limited to the followingprojects proposing to apply existing measures, methodologies, or analytic approaches to health disparity populations without specifically adapting or adjusting these approaches to address health disparity-related research questions are not a priority for support under this foadevelopment and pilot testing of new or adapted interventions. projects in this category are expected to focus primarily on testing the feasibility, acceptability and/or preliminary efficacy of new or adapted interventions for improving minority health and reducing health disparities in the us. testing preliminary efficacy refers to the examination of the impact of the intervention on short-term outcomes related to health attitudes, cognitions, behaviors, or health status. it is not expected that pilot project results will be used to generate effect sizes for future studies. projects should be supported by a conceptual model that includes a rationale for why new or adapted interventions are needed for the target population. potential intervention approaches include but are not limited to the following:projects with the sole rationale being that an existing intervention has never been tested with the target population(s) are not a priority for this foa.as appropriate for the research questions posed, projects may involve partnerships with relevant stakeholders such as community-based organizations, faith-based organizations, patient advocacy groups, clinicians and healthcare organizations, state and local health departments, schools, housing agencies, and other organizations. inclusion of key stakeholders in the conceptualization, planning and implementation of the research is encouraged where appropriate to generate better-informed hypotheses and facilitate future translation of research findings into practice.see section viii. other information for award authorities and regulations.investigators proposing nih-defined clinical trials may refer to the
