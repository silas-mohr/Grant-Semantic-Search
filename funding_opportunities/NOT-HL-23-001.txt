institute on aging (nia)national institute of environmental health sciences (niehs)national institute of neurological disorders and stroke (ninds)national institute on minority health and health disparities (nimhd)national cancer institute (nci)the purpose of this notice of special interest (nosi) is to stimulate novel epidemiological research to address key knowledge gaps within and between subpopulations of asian americans, native hawaiians, and pacific islanders. these populations are frequently aggregated in research, potentially masking important social and health differences. given clear heterogeneity in ancestry, culture, immigration patterns among asian americans, socioeconomic position, and acculturation into american life, a critical need exists for epidemiological research to enhance our understanding of the interplay of environmental exposures, lifestyle, behavioral, genomics, social, neighborhood, and biological factors that impact the health of asian american, native hawaiian, and pacific islander subpopulations.background:asian americans comprise over 6% of the united states (us) population and represent the fastest growing population group, more than doubling in size from 10.5 million persons in 2000 to more than 23 million in 2020. asian americans trace their ancestry to at least 19 countries in east and southeast asia and the indian subcontinent. native hawaiians and other pacific islanders trace their origins to the original peoples of polynesia, micronesia, and melanesia, and are the third fastest growing us population group with over 1 million persons. the trans-nih workshop, identifying research opportunities for asian american, native hawaiian, and pacific islander health, held from march 30, 2021 to april 1, 2021 reported a general paucity of fundamental epidemiological data on prevalence, incidence, and factors of risk and resilience across most domain areas as a major theme emerging from the workshop. therefore, an urgent need exists to distinguish potential mechanisms, etiology, and pathways by which risk exposures impact health outcomes in these understudied population groups.research objectives:the objective of this notice is to encourage fundamental epidemiological research geared toward understanding the inter-relationships of biological, lifestyle/behavioral, environmental, and sociocultural factors and how these factors may impact health disparities and outcomes in asian american, native hawaiian, and pacific islander subpopulations. epidemiological inference is enhanced with variation in study designs; therefore, investigators may leverage a range of design methods in response to this nosi, including electronic health record databases, registries, cohort studies, and cross-sectional surveys. applications may propose leveraging existing studies or data, or may propose new data collection.to be considered responsive to this nosi, applicants must propose to study at least one specific subpopulation of asian americans, native hawaiians, and pacific islanders. applicants may propose to also include a non-asian american, native hawaiian, or pacific islander population group as a comparator or proposed innovative analytical methods for within group comparisons as appropriate.ic specific application and submission information:applicants must select the ic and associated funding opportunity announcement (foa) to use for submission of an application in response to this nosi. the selection must align with the ic requirements listed in order to be considered responsive to that foa. non-responsive applications will be withdrawn from consideration for this initiative. in addition, applicants using nih parent announcement (listed below) will be assigned to those ics on this nosi that have indicated that pa-20-185 - nih research project grant (parent r01 clinical trial not allowed) is acceptable and based on usual application-ic assignment practices.all instructions in the sf424 (r&r) application guide and the listed funding opportunity announcements must be followed, with the following additions:national cancer institute (nci)the national cancer institute encourages applications that will elucidate and advance our understanding of factors (individual, neighborhood/community, structural, institutional, biological, physical, geographic, occupational, historical, social, and environmental) that impact cancer risk and outcome across the cancer control continuum for diverse populations. when possible, responsive applicants should leverage existing data resources (e.g., electronic health records, registries, cancer epidemiology cohorts) and/or conducting relevant data collection to enhance understanding of the cancer burden in asian american, native hawaiian, pacific islander subpopulations to inform prevention and intervention strategies. of special considerations are applications that collect culturally-appropriate and psychometrically sound measures (https://www.nationalacademies.org/our-work/improving-health-research-on-small-populations-a-workshop) or those using novel analytical methods or approaches, such as conducting within-group comparisons, to advance understanding of varying cancer incidence and mortality in asian americans, native hawaiians, and pacific islanders.specific topics of interest include, but not limited to:national human genome research institute (nhgri)nhgri supports approaches, and technologies that will accelerate genomic research that helps to understand structure of genomes, the biology of genomes, and the biology of disease; that will use genomics to advance the science of medicine; and that will incorporate genomics to improve the effectiveness of healthcare.in general, nhgri supports studies that provide generalizable methods and knowledge. applications for studies relevant only to a particular disease or organ system should be directed to the appropriate institute or center. applications whose primary scientific objective is to understand a single biological or behavioral process, the pathophysiology of a disease, or the mechanism of action of an intervention, will not be in scope for nhgri. approaches that are comprehensive across the genome or are generalizable across variants, tissues, diseases, or function may be in scope for nhgri to the extent they address the research mission of nhgri’s extramural divisions:priority areas:statistics or epidemiologypopulation geneticscomputational or functional genomicsnational heart, lung, and blood institute (nhlbi)the national heart, lung, and blood institute (nhlbi) encourages submission of applications to fill knowledge gaps on topics within the mission of nhlbi. of particular interest are studies elucidating patterns of acculturation within and across multiple generations; discrimination, neighborhood context, and other social determinants of health and how these factors may impact cardiometabolic risk; characterization of sleep patterns and risk of obstructive sleep apnea; and the association of immigration patterns and cardiometabolic risk in second generation adolescents.specific topics of interest include but are not limited to:national institute on aging (nia)the national institute on aging (nia) promotes genetic, molecular, biological, behavioral, social, and economic research related to aging and life-course health, including research on alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ad/adrd). ?a strategic priority of nia is the understanding of health differences and development of strategies to improve the health status and well-being of older adults in diverse populations, such as asian americans and pacific islanders. nia encourages comparisons between asian american and pacific islander subpopulations, such as chinese, vietnamese, and korean, as well as research on factors affecting health and longevity, such as cultural affiliation, socioeconomic and geographic inequality, gender differences, discrimination, resilience, and stress, among asian americans and pacific islanders.nia interests in this area include, but are not limited to, the following:applications are expected to factor sex as a biological variable into research designs, analyses and scientific reporting. applicants should review the strategic directions for research, 2020 – 2025. applications whose research focuses on ad/adrd should also review the ad/adrd research milestones for more information on research priorities.national institute of environmental health sciences (niehs)the national institute of environmental health sciences encourages submissions of applications that are within the mission of niehs, which is to discover how the environment affects people to promote healthier lives. exposures of interest include, but are not limited to, chemicals that people are exposed to via air, water, food, or direct dermal exposure (e.g., personal care products), including air pollutants, pesticides, metals, industrial chemicals, nanomaterials, environmental tobacco smoke, certain microbial products, and certain physical agents, such as environmental radiation. applications examining the impacts of climate change on health are encouraged and could include a focus on weather extremes (e.g., prolonged or excessively high heat waves, droughts, severe unseasonal cold spells) and extreme weather-related disasters (e.g., hurricanes, storm surges, floods, wildfires) attributed to our changing climate.specific topics of interest include but are not limited to environmental epidemiology studies:the niehs strongly supports research conducted in partnership with communities. studies that utilize community engaged and/or citizen science approaches done in partnership with asian american, native hawaiian and pacific islander communities and/or community-based organizations are strongly encouraged. applications that utilize report-back methods to increase the environmental health literacy within these subpopulations are also strongly encouraged.national institute on minority health and health disparities (nimhd)the mission of the nimhd is to lead scientific research to improve minority health and reduce health disparities. nimhd supports the study of many aspects of minority health and health disparities— from biological and population sciences to clinical, behavioral, and translational research, as well as research on health care services, health systems. nimhd focuses on the full continuum of causes of health disparities and the interrelation of these causes. projects must include studies on health advantages and or health disparities in asian american (aa), native hawaiian, and pacific islander (nhpi) subpopulations in the united states, including the us territories (guam, puerto rico, american samoa, commonwealth of the northern mariana islands, and us virgin islands). studies must disaggregate between asians and native hawaiians/pacific islanders and when possible, within each of these distinct racial groups. comparison groups/populations may also be included as appropriate for the research questions posed.projects are also expected to focus on human and population-based studies in the biomedical, clinical, population, behavioral or social sciences. this can include research with human participants and/or secondary analyses of existing human data or specimens collected in research or clinical settings to investigate mechanisms underlying resilience or susceptibility to disease.nimhd encourages projects that use approaches encompassing multiple domains of influence (e.g., biological, behavioral, sociocultural, environmental, physical environment, health system) and multiple levels of influence (e.g., individual, interpersonal, family, peer group, community, societal) to understand and address health disparities (see the nimhd research framework for more information).national institute of neurological disorders and stroke (ninds)the national institute of neurological disorders and stroke is committed to reducing the disproportionate burden of neurological diseases experienced by underserved groups of society, including racial and ethnic minoritized, rural, and socioeconomically disadvantaged populations, by funding a spectrum of research from basic science through clinical studies. based on low numbers of asian american, native hawaiian, and pacific islander population groups in nih sponsored clinical studies, the ninds is encouraging the submission of applications to address knowledge gaps on topics related to neurological disorders and care in these sub-populations.ninds is particularly interested in:a letter of intent and communication with ninds program staff prior to submission of an application is strongly encouraged. observational studies should be theory-based to enable the future development of actionable items and evidence-based interventions.application and submission informationsubmit applications for this initiative using one of the following funding opportunity announcements (foas) or any reissues of
