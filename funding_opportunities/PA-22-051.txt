section iii. eligibility information section iv. application and submission information section v. application review information section vi. award administration information section vii. agency contacts section viii. other informationthe overall goal of the ahrq research career development program is to help ensure that a diverse pool of highly trained scientists is available in appropriate scientific disciplines to address the nation's health services research needs. in addition to this opportunity, ahrq supports other career development programs designed to foster research methodological skills development and progression towards research independence. more information about ahrq's career development programs may be found at the ahrq training and education website.the objective of the research career enhancement awards for established investigators in patient-centered outcome research (k18) is to provide support for experienced researchers and scientists who either wish to broaden their scientific capabilities or to advance their research careers by acquiring new research skills or knowledge. the purpose of this nofo is to provide such investigators with support for an intensive period of mentored research experience to acquire new research capabilities in research areas supported by ahrq. such experiences will afford candidate investigators protected time to: 1) enrich and expand their expertise and research programs through retooling in new techniques, emerging technologies, and/or scientific areas; and/or 2) redirect their research programs in new trajectories; and/or 3) catalyze research collaborations in new research directions. it is expected that this initiative will lead to new and/or augmented research programs competitive for ahrq funding.the purpose of pcor is to improve health outcomes by developing and disseminating evidence-based information to patients, clinicians, policy makers, and health care administrators, responding to their expressed needs about which clinical and health system design interventions are most effective for which patients under specific circumstances. research career training objectives and candidates must focus the content on health care delivery within the united states.for purposes of this nofo, pcor is defined as the conduct and synthesis of research comparing the benefits and harms of different interventions and strategies to prevent, diagnose, treat and monitor health conditions, as well as the delivery of health care in “real world” settings. the purpose of this research is to improve health outcomes by developing and disseminating evidence-based information to patients, clinicians, and other decision-makers, responding to their expressed needs, about which interventions are most effective for which patients under specific circumstances.the patient-centered outcomes research institute methodology committee was established to develop and improve the science and methods of comparative clinical effectiveness research. the committee’s recommended methodology standardsand subsequent updates can be found at www.pcori.org.example areas of methodological emphasis in applications may include, but are not limited to:required areas of emphasiscandidates must focus their research and career enhancement/development plans in one or both of the following areas:1. the reduction of disparities in health care outcomes and quality among racial and ethnic minority populations and underserved populations.applicant institutions that provide health care to racial and ethnic minority populations and underserved populations and/or have access to unique data on these populations should demonstrate how k18 candidates may use these opportuinities to design and implement research projects focusing on the reduction of specific and known disparities.additionally, ahrq intends that research funded by the agency contributes to promoting equity. accordingly, candidates are encouraged to propose projects addressing any healthcare delivery-related topic with demonstrated health inequities, including but not limited to:2. evaluating and comparing health care delivery system designs; developing and evaluating system redesigns; or implementing and disseminating effective, evidence-based design practices.candidates may focus their research on a wide range of issues within delivery systems research, including, but not limited to:candidates are strongly encouraged to emphasize and address the following:pursuant to its authorizing legislation, see 42 u.s.c. 299(c), ahrq conducts and supports research for ahrq priority populations (see section iv.7 for a list of priority populations). to this end, ahrq is interested in primary and secondary research for which either: 1) main analyses principally center on a priority population(s) or 2) exploratory interaction (subgroup) analyses can be conducted that yield results stratified by priority population.example areas of cer methodological emphasis could include, but are not limited to:pcor components include, but are not limited to:special note: to ensure that applications are responsive to ahrq priorites as well as nofo requirements, consultation with ahrq staff prior to application submission is encouraged.see section viii. other information for award authorities and regulations.grant: a support mechanism providing money, property, or both to an eligible entity to carry out an approved project or activity.new resubmissionthe oer glossary and the sf424 (r&r) application guide provide details on these application types. only those application types listed here are allowed for this nofo.clinical trials: optionalnote: candidates may propose to conduct a clinical trial.need help determining whether you are doing a clinical trial?the number of awards is contingent upon budget appropriations and the submission of a sufficient number of meritorious applications. future year funding is contingent upon the availability of funds for each year of support.award budgets are composed of salary and other program-related expenses, as described below. budget proposals must not exceed $275,000 total costs annually. facilities and administrative (f&a) costs are included in the total cost limitation. facilities and administrative costs are based on 8% of modified total direct costs (direct costs excluding tuition/fees and expenditures for equipment), or the applicant's actual f&a rate, whichever is less. an application that requests more than $275,000 total costs in any given year, or that exceeds two years in duration, will not undergo peer review. for applications that request a duration other that 12 or 24 months, the annual total cost budget of $275,000 is to be prorated accordingly (for example, a 6 month budget may not exceed $137,500 total cost).the total project period shall be between six (6) and twenty-four (24) months.ahrq will provide salary for the k18 candidate at a rate up to the congressionally-mandated salary limit in effect at the time of award. the total salary provided by the award will be prorated based on a full-time, 12-month staff appointment and the support period requested. the k18 requires the candidate to devote a minimum of 6 calendar months (equivalent to 50% of full-time professional effort) to conducting pcor. the remaining effort may be devoted to clinical, teaching, or other research pursuits and activities consistent with the objectives of the award.the total ahrq contribution to salary may not exceed the legislatively mandated salary cap. see: http://grants.ahrq.gov/grants/policy/salcap_summary.htm.the total salary requested must be based on a full-time staff appointment. the salary must be consistent both with the established salary structure at the institution and with salaries actually provided by the institution from its own funds to other staff members of equivalent qualifications, rank, and responsibilities in the department concerned.for effort directly committed to the k award, the sponsoring institution may supplement the ahrq salary contribution up to a level that is consistent with the institution's salary scale. however, supplementation may not be from federal funds unless specifically authorized by the federal program from which such funds are derived. institutional supplementation of salary must not require extra duties or responsibilities that would interfere with the purpose of the career award.fringe benefits will be provided at the institution's federally negotiated fringe benefit rate or, if a federally negotiated fringe benefit rate does not exist, at the actual fringe benefit rate in effect at the time of award.for effort not directly committed to the k award, the candidate may derive additional compensation for effort associated with other federal sources or awards provided the total salary derived from all federal sources does not exceed the maximum legislated salary rate and the total percent effort does not exceed 100%.further guidance on budgeting for career development salaries is provided in the sf424 (r&r) application guide.see also not-od-17-094.ahrq will provide up to $50,000 direct costs per year for the following expenses: a) tuition and fees related to career development; b) research related costs such as supplies, equipment, and technical personnel working with research data; c) travel to research meetings or training (including local or distance travel related to training that takes place at another site); d) statistical services including personnel and computer time; e) mentor salary and fringe benefits (up to $6,000) annually per mentor for a maximum of two mentors per candidate. all expenses must be directly related to the proposed research career development, not to living expenses.indirect costs (also known as facilities & administrative [f&a] costs) are reimbursed at 8% of modified total direct costs.42 u.s.c. 299b-37 authorizes ahrq to make these awards to support the training of researchers in the methods used to conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research.all applications submitted and ahrq grants made in response to this nofo are subject to 45 cfr part 75 (uniform administrative requirements, cost principles and audit requirements for hhs awards; http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?node=pt45.1.75), the hhs grants policy statement (see http://www.ahrq.gov/funding/policies/hhspolicy/index.html ), and the terms and conditions set forth in the notice of award.higher education institutionspublic/ or non-profit private institution such as a:the following types of higher education institutions are always encouraged to apply for ahrq support as public or private institutions of higher education:ahrq’s authorizing legislation does not allow for-profit organizations to be eligible to lead applications under this research mechanism. for-profit organizations may participate in projects as members of consortia or as subcontractors only. because the purpose of this program is to improve healthcare in the united states, foreign institutions may participate in projects as members of consortia or as subcontractors only. applications submitted by for-profit organizations or foreign institutions will not be reviewed. organizations described in section 501(c) 4 of the internal revenue code that engage in lobbying are not eligible.hhs grants policy requires that the grant recipient perform a substantive role in the conduct of the planned project or program activity and not merely serve as a conduit of funds to another party or parties. if consortium/contractual activities represent a significant portion of the overall project, the applicant must justify why the applicant organization, rather than the party(s) performing this portion of the overall project, should be the grantee and what substantive role the applicant organization will play. justification can be provided in the specific aims or research strategy section of the phs398 research plan component sections of the sf424 (r&r) application. there is no budget allocation guideline for determining substantial involvement; determination of substantial involvement is based on a review of the primary project activities for which grant support is provided and the organization(s) that will be performing those activities.non-domestic (non-u.s.) entities (foreign institutions) are not eligible to apply. non-domestic (non-u.s.) components of u.s. organizations are not eligible to apply.applicant organizationsapplicant organizations must complete and maintain the following registrations as described in the sf 424 (r&r) application guide to be eligible to apply for or receive an award. all registrations must be completed prior to the application being submitted. registration can take 6 weeks or more, so applicants should begin the registration process as soon as possible.dun and bradstreet universal numbering system (duns) - all registrations require that applicants be issued a duns number. after obtaining a duns number, applicants can begin both sam and era commons registrations. the same duns number must be used for all registrations, as well as on the grant application.system for award management (sam) – applicants must complete and maintain an active registration, which requires renewal at least annually. the renewal process may require as much time as the initial registration. sam registration includes the assignment of a commercial and government entity (cage) code for domestic organizations which have not already been assigned a cage code.o nato commercial and government entity (ncage) code – foreign organizations must obtain an ncage code (in lieu of a cage code) in order to register in sam.era commons - applicants must have an active duns number to register in era commons. organizations can register with the era commons as they are working through their sam or grants.gov registration, but all registrations must be in place by time of submission. era commons requires organizations to identify at least one signing official (so) and at least one program director/principal investigator (pd/pi) account in order to submit an application.grants.gov – applicants must have an active duns number and sam registration in order to complete the grants.gov registration.please note that a federal-wide transition from the dun and bradstreet (d&b) data universal numbering system (duns) number to a new government-owned unique entity identifier (uei) is underway. by april 2022, the federal government will stop using the duns number to uniquely identify entities registered in the system for award management (sam). sam will become the central repository for the new uei that will be incorporated into an institution’s sam registration. see not-od-21-170 (https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/not-od-21-170.html) for details.program director/principal investigator (pd/pi)the candidate pd/pi must have an era commons account and should work with their organizational officials to either create a new account or to affiliate their existing account with the applicant organization in era commons. if the pd/pi is also the organizational signing official, they must have two distinct era commons accounts, one for each role. obtaining an era commons account can take up to 2 weeks.please note that for applications with due dates of january 25, 2022, and after, all individuals listed in the sf424 r&r senior/key person profile (expanded) form will be required to have an era commons username (commons id). see not-od-21-109 (https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/not-od-21-109.html) for details.the pd/pi must be registered with orcid. the personal profile associated with the pd/pi era commons account must be linked to a valid orcid id. for more information on linking an orcid id to an era commons personal profile see the orcid topic in our era commons online help.any candidate with the skills, knowledge, and resources necessary to carry out the proposed research as the program director/principal investigator (pd/pi) is invited to work with his/her mentor and organization to develop an application for support. individuals from underrepresented racial and ethnic groups as well as individuals with disabilities are always encouraged to apply for ahrq support.multiple pds/pis are not allowed.this award is intended for mid-career and senior investigators holding a research or health professional doctorate who are at the academic rank of associate professor or professor (or the equivalent in nonacademic settings), who have established records of independent, peer-reviewed federal or private research grant funding, who seek an intense, mentored career development experience in comparative effectiveness methodology which will substantially improve their ability to pursue future research in pcor. targeted candidates are: (1) faculty, providers or investigators without expertise in comparative effectiveness research, who are located at institutions that do not possess intensive cer programs; and (2) faculty, providers or investigators who are located at institutions that possess intensive cer programs, but who do not possess individual expertise in cer.each career enhancement program in cer must be tailored to meet the individual needs of the candidate. the candidate and mentor are jointly responsible for the preparation of the career development plan. the sponsoring institution must demonstrate a commitment to provide the environment and resources needed for the

card uscis form i-551, or other legal verification of such status).this nofo does not require cost sharing.while there is no cost sharing requirement included in this nofo, ahrq welcomes applicant institutions, including any collaborating institutions, to devote resources to this effort. an indication of institutional support from the applicant and its collaborators indicates a greater potential of success and sustainability of the project. examples of institutional support would include donated equipment and space, institutional funded staff time and effort, or other resource investments. applicant institutions should indicate institutional support by outlining the specific contributions to the project and providing assurances that their organization and any collaborators are committed to providing these funds and resources to the project. this information can be included at the end of the budget justification section of the application, but institutional support dollars are not to be shown/included in the detailed budget request.applicant organizations may submit more than one application, provided that each application is scientifically distinct, and each is from a different candidate.the ahrq will not accept duplicate or highly overlapping applications under review at the same time, per 2.3.7.4 submission of resubmission application. an individual may not have two or more competing ahrq career development applications pending review concurrently. in addition, ahrq will not accept:a new (a0) application that is submitted before issuance of the summary statement from the review of an overlapping new (a0) or resubmission (a1) application.a resubmission (a1) application that is submitted before issuance of the summary statement from the review of the previous new (a0) application.an application that has substantial overlap with another application pending appeal of initial peer review (see not-od-18-197).the k18 requires the candidate to devote a minimum of 6 calendar months (equivalent to 50% of full-time professional effort) to conducting pcor. the proposed duration of the award may span a minimum of six continuous months to a maximum of 24 continuous months. the amount of effort devoted to the program over the course of each 12-month period can vary, so long as the required minimum level of effort (i.e., 50% of full-time effort over the duration of the award) is achieved. for example, a candidate could propose 100% effort for a 6 month award, or 50% effort for a 12 month award, or 25% effort for the first 6 months and 75% effort for the final six months of a 12 month award, etc., provided the overall level of effort over the duration of the project is 50%.the allowance for a part-time commitment of professional effort will enable candidates to hold their ongoing research grants (if applicable) and/or meet their academic responsibilities in a limited capacity, as they pursue the career enhancement program. candidates should describe any clinical, administrative, teaching, mentoring or grant-related research commitments they intend to maintain during the period of the award, and the arrangements to be made with the home institution and/or the sponsoring institution to ensure the requisite protected time for this award period.in no case will a reduction of total effort below 50% over the course of the duration of the entire project in order to accept other federal funding be allowed. in addition, no redistribution of the proposed levels of effort across the duration of the course of the project will be allowed once a grant is awarded.at the time of award, the candidate must have a “full-time” appointment at the applicant institution.candidates who have va appointments may not consider part of the va effort toward satisfying the full-time requirement at the applicant institution. candidates with va appointments should contact the the scientific/research contact listed under agency contacts in section vii of this nofoprior to preparing an application to discuss their eligibility. candidates with a full-time va appointment are not eligible to apply.candidates to this program may not concurrently apply for any other phs award that duplicates the provisions of this nofo. k18 award recipients may hold concurrent federal and non-federal grant/contract support as a pd/pi or sub-project director with this award provided the aggregate effort does not exceed 12 calendar months (i.e.100%).candidates may have one individual career development award application pending peer review at any time.before submitting the application, the candidate must identify a mentor who will supervise the proposed career development and research experience. the mentor should be an active investigator in the area of the proposed research and be committed both to the career development of the candidate and to the direct supervision of the candidate’s research. the mentor must document the availability of sufficient research support and facilities for high-quality research. candidates are encouraged to identify more than one mentor, i.e., a mentoring team, if this is deemed advantageous for providing expert advice in all aspects of the research career development program. in such cases, one individual must be identified as the primary mentor who will coordinate the candidate’s research. the candidate must work with the mentor(s) in preparing the application. members of the mentoring team should have a successful track record of mentoring individuals at the candidate’s career stage. where feasible, the recruitment of women, individuals from diverse racial and ethnic groups, and individuals with disabilities as potential mentors is encouraged, given their ability to serve as role models.the mentor(s) or mentoring team must demonstrate appropriate expertise, experience, and ability to guide the candidate in the organization, management and implementation of the proposed research and clinical trial.signed statements must be provided by each consultant/collaborator confirming their participation in the project and describing their specific roles. a consultant must state their daily or hourly consulting rate and specify the number of hours or days to be devoted. collaborators and consultants generally do not need to provide

federal holiday, the application deadline is automatically extended to the next business day.organizations must submit applications to grants.gov (the online portal to find and apply for grants across all federal agencies) using assist or other electronic submission systems. applicants must then complete the submission process by tracking the status of the application in the era commons, nih’s electronic system for grants administration. nih and grants.gov systems check the application against many of the application instructions upon submission. errors must be corrected, and a changed/corrected application must be submitted to grants.gov on or before the application due date. and time. if a changed/corrected application is submitted after the deadline, the application will be considered late. applications that miss the due date and time are subjected to the nih policy on late application submission.applicants are responsible for viewing their application before the due date in the era commons to ensure accurate and successful submission.information on the submission process and a definition of on-time submission are provided in the sf424 (r&r) application guide.this initiative is not subject to intergovernmental review.for efficient grant administration, ahrq grant administration procedures will be used and conducted in accordance with the terms and conditions, cost principles, and other considerations described in the hhs grants policy statement. the grants policy statement can be found at http://www.ahrq.gov/funding/grants/policies/hhspolicy.html.pre-award costs are allowable only as described in the hhs grants policy statement.a grantee may, at its own risk and without ahrq prior approval, incur obligations and expenditures to cover costs up to 90 days before the beginning date of the initial budget period of a new award if such costs are necessary to conduct the project and would be allowable under the grant, if awarded, without ahrq prior approval. if specific expenditures would otherwise require prior approval, the grantee must obtain ahrq approval before incurring the cost. ahrq prior approval is required for any costs to be incurred more than 90 days before the beginning date of the initial budget period of a new award.the incurrence of pre-award costs in anticipation of a competing or non-competing award imposes no obligation on ahrq either to make the award or to increase the amount of the approved budget if an award is made for less than the amount anticipated and is inadequate to cover the pre-award costs incurred. ahrq expects the grantee to be fully aware that pre-award costs result in borrowing against future support and that such borrowing must not impair the grantee's ability to accomplish the project objectives in the approved time frame or in any way adversely affect the conduct of the project.applications must be submitted electronically following the instructions described in the sf424 (r&r) application guide. paper applications will not be accepted.applicants must complete all required registrations before the application due date. section iii. eligibility information contains information about

the application submission contacts in section vii.important reminders:the pd/pi must include his/her era commons id in the credential field of the senior/key person profile component of the sf424(r&r) application package. failure to register in the commons and to include a valid pd/pi commons id in the credential field will prevent the successful submission of an electronic application to ahrq.the applicant organization must ensure that the duns number it provides on the application is the same number used in the organization’s profile in the era commons and for the system for award management (sam). additional information may be found in the sf424 (r&r) application guide.see more tips for avoiding common errors.upon receipt, applications will be evaluated for completeness and compliance with application instructions by ahrq. applications that are incomplete or non-compliant will not be reviewed.institutional review board (irb) approval of human subjects is not required prior to peer review of an application (see https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/not-hs-00-003.html). however, initiation of irb review, if necessary or applicable, is strongly encouraged to assure timely commencement of research.although there is no immediate acknowledgement of the receipt of an application, applicants are generally notified of the review and funding assignment within eight (8) weeks.priority populationsahrq’s authorizing legislation provides that ahrq shall, in carrying out its mission, conduct and support research and evaluations, and support demonstration projects, with respect to the delivery of health care in inner-city and rural areas (including frontier areas); and health care for priority populations, which include low-income groups; minority groups; women; children; the elderly; and individuals with special health care needs, including individuals with disabilities and individuals who need chronic care or end-of-life health care. 42 u.s.c. 299(c)(1). ahrq also must ensure that these requirements are reflected in the overall portfolio of research conducted and supported by the agency. 42 u.s.c. 299(c)(2).ahrq is committed to the inclusion of priority populations in health services research. the overall portfolio of health services research that ahrq conducts and supports shall include the populations specifically named in ahrq’s authorizing legislation: inner city; rural; low income; minority; women; children; elderly; and those with special health care needs, including those who have disabilities, need chronic care, or need end-of-life health care. ahrq also includes in its definition of priority populations those groups identified in section 2(a) of executive order 13985 as members of underserved communities: black, latino, and indigenous and native american persons, asian americans and pacific islanders and other persons of color; members of religious minorities; lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (lgbtq+) persons; persons with disabilities; persons who live in rural areas; and persons otherwise adversely affected by persistent poverty or inequality.ahrq will broadly implement this inclusion policy across the research that ahrq supports and conducts so that the portfolio of research is inclusive of all populations. ahrq intends that these populations be included in studies such that the research design explicitly allows conduct of valid analyses. the policy applies to all grant applications. investigators should review the document entitled, “ahrq policy on the inclusion of priority populations,” which is available at https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/not-hs-21-015.html. candidates under this nofo must consider and discuss including priority populations in research design as specified in this notice. applicants must include a one-page proposed inclusion plan for priority populations in the "other attachments" section of the application.public access to ahrq-funded scientific publicationsinvestigators should review the document titled ‘ahrq announces new policy for public access to ahrq-funded scientific publications’, which is available at (http://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/not-hs-16-008.html). for all research arising from ahrq support, this policy requires that ahrq-funded authors submit an electronic version of the author’s final peer-reviewed accepted manuscript to the national library of medicine's pubmed central (pmc) to be made publicly available within 12 months of the publisher’s date of publication.plan for sharing research datathe precise content of the data-sharing plan will vary, depending on the data being collected and how the investigator is planning to share the data. applicants who are planning to share data should describe briefly the expected schedule for data sharing; the format of the final dataset; the documentation to be provided; whether or not any analytic tools also will be provided; whether or not a data-sharing agreement will be required and, if so, a brief description of such an agreement (including the criteria for deciding who can receive the data and whether or not any conditions will be placed on their use); and the mode of data sharing (e.g., under its own auspices by mailing a disk or posting data on its institutional or personal website or through a data archive or enclave). investigators choosing to share under their own auspices may wish to enter into a data-sharing agreement. references to data sharing may also be appropriate in other sections of the application.the reasonableness of the data sharing plan or the rationale for not sharing research data will be assessed by the reviewers. however, reviewers will not factor the proposed data sharing plan into the determination of scientific merit or the priority score.ahrq data management plan policyinvestigators should review the document titled ahrq data management plan (dmp) policy, which is available at (https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/not-hs-20-011.html). this policy requires applicants for ahrq new/competing grants and research contracts to include a dmp for managing, storing and disseminating the primary data, samples, physical collections and other supporting materials created or gathered in the course of research funded by ahrq, or state why data management is not possible, as a component of their grant application or research contract proposal.data confidentialitythe ahrq confidentiality statute, 42 usc 299c-3(c), requires that information that is obtained in the course of ahrq supported activities and that identifies individuals or establishments be used only for the purpose for which it was supplied. information that is obtained in the course of ahrq-supported activities and that identifies an individual may be published or released only with the consent of the individual who supplied the information or is described in it. there are civil monetary penalties for violation of the confidentiality provision of the ahrq statute. 42 usc 299c-3(d). in the human subjects section of the application, applicants must describe procedures for ensuring the confidentiality of the identifying information to be collected (see not-hs-18-012: confidentiality in ahrq-supported research). the description of the procedures should include a discussion of who will be permitted access to this information, both raw data and machine readable files, and how personal identifiers and other identifying or identifiable data will be restricted and safeguarded. identifiable patient health information collected by grantees under this rfa will also be obtained and managed in accordance with the hipaa privacy rule, 45 cfr parts 160 and 164.the grantee should ensure that computer systems containing confidential data have a level and scope of security that equals or exceeds that established by the hipaa security rules if applicable (see hipaa website in prior paragraph) and that established by the office of management and budget (omb) in omb circular no. a-130, appendix iii - security of federal automated information systems. the applicability and intended means of applying these confidentiality and security standards to subcontractors and vendors, if any, should be addressed in the application.sharing research resources: rights in dataunless otherwise provided in grant awards, ahrq grantees may copyright, or seek patents for, as appropriate, final and interim products and materials developed in whole or in part with ahrq support, including, but not limited to, methodological tools, measures, software with documentation, literature searches, and analyses. such copyrights and patents are subject to a royalty-free, non-exclusive, and irrevocable ahrq license to reproduce, publish, use or disseminate for any purpose consistent with ahrq’s statutory responsibilities and to authorize others to do so for any purpose consistent with ahrq’s statutory responsibilities. in accordance with its legislative dissemination mandate, ahrq purposes may include, subject to statutory confidentiality protections, making project materials, databases, results, and algorithms available for verification or replication by other researchers. in addition, subject to ahrq budget constraints, final products may be made available to the health care community and the public by ahrq or its agents if such distribution would significantly increase access to a product and thereby produce substantial or valuable public health benefits. ordinarily, to accomplish distribution, ahrq publicizes research findings but relies on grantees to publish research results in peer-reviewed journals and to market grant-supported products. ahrq requests that grantees notify the office of communications (oc) when an ahrq-funded research article has been accepted for publication in a peer-reviewed journal. researchers should submit manuscripts that have been accepted for publication in a peer-reviewed journal to journalpublishing@ahrq.hhs.gov at least four to six weeks in advance of the journal’s expected publication date.regulations applicable to ahrq grantees concerning intangible rights and copyright can be found at 45 cfr 75.322.applicants are required to follow the instructions for post-submission materials, as described in not-od-19-083 (https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/not-od-19-083.html). any instructions provided here are in addition to the instructions in the policy.the mission of ahrq is to produce evidence to make health care safer, higher quality, more accessible, equitable, and affordable, and to work with the u.s. department of health and human services (hhs) and other partners to make sure that the evidence is understood and used.ahrq's priority areas of focus are detailed here: https://www.ahrq.gov/funding/policies/nofoguidance/index.html. as part of this mission, applications are
