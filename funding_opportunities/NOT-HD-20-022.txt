october 1, 2020pa-20-200 - nih small research grant program (parent r03 clinical trial not allowed)eunice kennedy shriver national institute of child health and human development (nichd)purposethis notice of special interest (nosi) encourages applications that propose to conduct secondary analyses using publicly available nichd-funded data sets or stored biospecimens. the goal of this program is to facilitate innovative yet cost-effective research utilizing data and biospecimens collected with nichd resources.backgroundresearch studies supported by nichd and other scientific funders often produce data and/or specimens with utility beyond the hypotheses and questions the original research projects were designed to address. the types of data available for analysis by researchers outside the original research team include data from clinical trials, panel studies and other longitudinal research, cross-sectional studies, observational studies, multi-method studies, and other types of basic biomedical, clinical, behavioral, demographic, and epidemiological research. secondary use of existing data offers a cost-effective way to foster research within the scientific mission of the nichd. supporting secondary data analysis also lowers costs to researchers, especially researchers early in their careers and/or at resource-limited institutions, by decreasing the time and funds required to engage in research.in the past, limited data availability and poor documentation of available data were major barriers to secondary analysis of data and biospecimens. ongoing nih and nichd support for data sharing, expanding nih data and resource sharing requirements, and the development of standards for data documentation and metadata are all factors that have increased the amount and quality of data available for secondary analysis has increased.examples of nichd datasets and research resources include: the nichd data and specimen hub (dash), data sharing for demographic research (dsdr), the child language development exchange (childes), the mouse genome informatics (mgi), and xenbase.scopethis initiative encourages secondary analysis on scientific topics within the scientific scope of nichd overall and the research priorities of the nichd extramural scientific branches and ncmrr. research involving linking existing data to complementary data sources such as administrative records, vital statistics, or spatial data is encouraged. topics of interest include, but are not limited to:program prioritiesthe highest priority of this initiative is to support applications proposing secondary analysis on research topics within the scientific mission of the nichd and the scientific scope of the nichd extramural scientific branches or ncmrr that use data or biospecimens produced or collected with nichd support.potential applicants are encouraged to contact nichd program staff in their area of scientific interest prior to submission.application and submission informationthis notice applies to due dates on or after october 16, 2020 and subsequent receipt dates through may 8, 2023.submit applications for this initiative using one of the following funding opportunity announcements (foas) or any reissues of these announcement through the expiration date of this notice.pa-20-200 nih small research grant program (parent r03 clinical trial not allowed)all instructions in the sf424 (r&r) application guide and the funding opportunity announcement used for submission must be followed, with the following additions:although nichd is not listed as a participating organization in all the foas listed above, applications for this initiative will be accepted.applications nonresponsive to terms of this nosi will be withdrawn from consideration for this initiative.scientific/research contactregina bures, phd eunice kennedy shriver national institute of child health and human development (nichd) telephone: 301-496-9485 email: regina.bures@nih.govweekly toc for this announcement nih funding opportunities and noticesnote: for help accessing pdf, rtf, ms word, excel, powerpoint, audio or video files, see help downloading files.
