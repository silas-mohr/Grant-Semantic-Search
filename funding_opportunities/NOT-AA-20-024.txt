early stage investigator research project grant (r01 basic experimental studies with humans required)national institute on alcohol abuse and alcoholism (niaaa)the purpose of this notice is to inform potential applicants of the niaaa’s special interest in research project applications studying the harmful effects of alcohol on the body’s tissues, organs, and systems in diverse populations across the lifespan.backgroundalcohol consumption is among the 10 leading causes of disability-adjusted life years and ranks as the third leading preventable cause of death. in the united states alone, the cost of excessive alcohol use reached $249 billion/year, of which nearly 20 percent is for direct medical expenses. the harmful use of alcohol affects virtually all tissues and is linked with dysfunction and failure of many organs and systems including the liver, heart, pancreas, lung, bone, and skeletal muscle, as well as digestive, vascular, endocrine, and immune systems. excessive and chronic alcohol consumption increases the risk of several infectious diseases and cancers and can cause birth defects, resulting in major public health concerns. besides, alcohol misuse often results in comorbidity and complex pathologies, further increasing the healthcare burden.within each organ system, there is a spectrum of possible alcohol-related pathological processes reflected by specific manifestations. for example, the liver may exhibit fatty liver, alcoholic hepatitis (ah), or cirrhosis. in the lung, alcohol consumption is associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome and an increased risk of pneumonia. alcohol-related organ diseases (arod) often exhibit highly heterogeneous, multifactorial pathologies with a long preclinical period prior to the onset of clinically significant symptoms. studies have shown that various environmental and host factors such as genetics, nutrition, co-existing diseases, age, gender, and race/ethnicity may be involved in the incidence and severity of arod. moreover, people with one alcohol-related disease are at increased risk for multi-organ damage, implicating systemic response to alcohol. for example, in severe ah, sepsis and multi-organ failure are often observed. however, it is still unknown why some people who drink heavily but not others develop the disease, and the underlying mechanisms on the development and progression of alcohol-related diseases have not been fully understood.emerging evidence indicates that alcohol-induced injuries develop in a cascade manner and reflect complex interactions between various endogenous and exogenous factors. many alcohol-related diseases are associated with differential expression of genes that inhibit tissue repair and promote inflammation. sustained, and a high level of inflammation and endotoxemia are the key players in tissue damage that, in combination with suppressed wound healing, lead to the failure of tissue repair, resulting in the progression of acute injury to chronicity. other mechanisms that contribute to the initiation and progression of alcohol-related tissue injury include abnormal lipid metabolism, oxidative stress, and the production of reactive oxygen species as well as remodeling of the extracellular matrix and fibrogenesis. a better understanding of various molecular and cellular mechanisms of alcohol-induced tissue injury and organ damage, both at the systemic and local levels, will provide new avenues for developing effective treatments of arod.research objectivesapplications submitted to this nosi are expected to elucidate the complex biology of alcohol-induced pathology and address any areas where knowledge gaps exist. research on understanding and managing arod is still needed. to address these needs, research approaches must be conducted ranging from the fundamental mechanisms to clinical studies that analyze existing, or newly collected, data and biological specimens using novel analytical tools. basic research programs that integrate host and environmental factors with clinical aspects and identify mechanisms or processes related to clinically relevant pathological conditions, and/or translational studies that are potentially interventional and that identify therapeutic targets for the treatment of arod are of particular interest.areas of interest and examples of research studies
