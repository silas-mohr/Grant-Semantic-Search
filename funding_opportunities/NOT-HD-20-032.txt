announcement should fall within the mission of the institutes/centers. the following nih offices may co-fund applications assigned to those institutes/centers.division of program coordination, planning and strategic initiatives, office of disease prevention (odp)the purpose of this notice of special interest (nosi) is to solicit applications to support multi-disciplinary scientific teams proposing research using systems science approaches to address persistent public health challenges. systems science refers to multi-level methodologies addressing complex behavioral and social phenomena. this initiative encourages applications for both basic and applied research, including methodological and measurement development, with a focus on human behavioral and/or social science. this initiative also seeks to promote interdisciplinary collaboration among health researchers and experts in mathematical modelling.backgroundsystems science is an interdisciplinary field comprising methodological approaches that address dynamic connections between a system’s structure and its behavior over time. “systems science methodologies” is an umbrella term that refers to a variety of methodologies including, but not limited to, agent-based modeling, microsimulation, system dynamics modeling, network analysis, discrete event analysis, markov modeling, econometric modeling, engineering methods, and a variety of other dynamic modeling and simulation approaches.systems science methodologies are valuable because they can address complex behavioral and social phenomena. these models and other novel analytic tools can be used to elucidate behavioral and social pathways and relationships and to assess population-level health policy and behavioral intervention options. by facilitating the modeling of social and behavioral determinants of health, systems science models advance scientific understanding of the underlying factors contributing to persistent public health problems.specific interestseunice kennedy shriver national institute of child health and human development (nichd)the mission of nichd is to lead research and training to understand human development, improve reproductive health, enhance the lives of children and adolescents, and optimize abilities for all.general topics of interest include basic and applied research on models of behavioral and social processes associated with health, disability, and developmental outcomes from pre-conception to adulthood. nichd is particularly interested in models that focus primarily on computational, econometric, mathematical, or engineering methods to improve the measurement and modeling of the following topics:scientific topics of low priority to nichd include: disease-specific processes and prevention that are central to the mission of other ics.national cancer institute (nci)nci leads and supports research to advance scientific knowledge and help people live longer, healthier lives. nci has a strong interest in primary prevention and in understanding the development, maintenance and improvement of multiple health behaviors associated with risk of cancer and with health disparities that emerge over the life course. many of these behaviors have their roots in early development, childhood and adolescence. because of the long latency of cancer and tracking of health behaviors over the life course, systems science can play a vital role in understanding the development of risk-related behavior over the life course and its consequences of cancer incidence and mortality, as well as modelling positive and negative consequences of programs, policies, and environments aimed at improving child health. nci is interested in research proposals that address cancer risk factors and cancer incidence and mortality over the life course, including, but not limited to:proposals should explicitly address the complex relationships between demographic, social, and environmental determinants of cancer-related health behaviors and physiological characteristics such as obesity. nci is interested in models of diverse cancer risk-factors, but will give low priority to grants making little or no effort to link their results to population level cancer incidence and mortality.office of disease prevention (odp)the mission of the odp is to improve public health by increasing the scope, quality, dissemination, and impact of prevention research supported by the nih. the odp is interested in co-funding research that uses systems science approaches to improve measurement and modeling related to:in addition, the odp encourages applications to support projects led by early stage investigators. for more information about odp strategic priorities,
