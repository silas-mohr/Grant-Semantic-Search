(foa) invites applications that propose transformative engineering solutions to technical challenges associated with new development, substantial optimization of existing technologies and clinical translation of intraoral biodevices. proposed technologies are expected to advance development of oral biodevices clinical use , including but not limited to: precision medicine-based detection, diagnosis and treatment of oral and overall health conditions, and measurement of patient functional status and clinical outcome assessment. areas of interest in this foa include engineering

of laboratory-based assays including microscopy, tissue and microbial cultures, immunoassays and nucleic-acid amplification. while development of many of these highly-sensitive and robust assays has revolutionized evidence-based diagnostics, in many situations, a continuous, non-invasive real-time assessment would offer additional significant advantages for delivery of evidence-based care.advances in biomaterial sciences, biomanufacturing, microfluidics and nanotechnology are leading to development of next generation simple, fast and reliable diagnostic devices, including biosensors, capable of real-time, continuous and noninvasive quantification of biological, chemical, and physical processes for health surveillance and rapid disease detection. amperometric-, optical-, surface plasmon resonance-, enzymatic-, dna-, phage-, and bacterial-based biosensors have shown significant promise for detection of a broad spectrum of biological analytes in medical laboratories and food bioanalysis. such technologies could be utilized in biosensors as well. additionally, biosensors are increasingly being used to augment therapeutic drug regimens by strengthening patient compliance. as biosensor technologies continue to advance towards smaller more accurate and application-specific integratable, wearable, and embeddable devices, these devices will become important components of medical diagnostics and monitoring that will allow for obtaining clinically-relevant outputs and endpoints indicative of health status, disease progression, and patients’ compliance with treatment regimens.gaps and opportunitiesthis foa seeks to address key technical barriers affecting the safety and overall performance of biodevices specifically designed to function within the oral cavity. while the oral cavity offers unique advantages to access real-time, continuous, noninvasive, physiological measurements, the oral environment presents specific design and performance requirements that need to be addressed according to target clinical applications. therefore, a systems engineering approach is needed to address major design challenges imposed by the oral environment, including: mastication forces, varying ph levels and temperatures, oral flora, adhesion to wet intraoral tissues, interference with speech, breathing and nutritional intake, material biocompatibility, and prevention of injury to oral tissues.the oral cavity is an attractive site for developing integrated biosensor-drug delivery-mobile notification devices that would improve treatment of many oral diseases and, in certain cases, would enable systemic delivery of therapeutics in an effective and patient acceptable manner. such systems would enable precise dosing of medications, enhance medication compliance, and reduce drug-related side effects. pairing of pharmaceutical products with delivery devices requires close attention to their design, function, and efficacy. an oral biodevice with combined sensing and drug delivery features must consider many different design factors including, drug release profiles, performance requirements dictated by the oral environment and patient acceptance. design of the release profile for integrated biosensor-drug delivery systems would depend on the condition being treated along with specific parameters of the patient’s metabolism, genetics, epigenetics, diet, and intake of other medications.specific objectivesthis foa seeks to advance meaningful development and substantial optimization of enabling technologies and systems engineering approaches to accelerate innovation and translation of intraoral biosensors and biodevices to clinical practice. areas of interest include, but are not limited to: improving the quality of biocompatible materials for optimal device functionality, preventing or minimizing material biofouling and advancing low-power/miniaturized/flexible electronics. in addition, this foa will support advancing the capabilities of long-term power cells, integrating biosensors with implantable devices and mobile notification systems, securing wireless data transmission and developing technologies that enable reliable adhesion of biosensors and biodevices to wet intraoral tissues.examples of research projects may include, but are not limited to the following:enabling

to deliver transformative engineering solutions to technical challenges associated with meaningful development, substantial optimization or clinical translation of intraoral biodevices and how the development and integration of such approaches will significantly benefit precision medicine-based detection, diagnosis and treatment of oral and overall health conditionsresearch plans are to include adequate rationale for design requirements, and design verification/validation activities aimed to establish preclinical safety and effective performance benchmarks of proposed technologies in the context of target clinical applications according to recognized industry standards and fda regulatory considerations. product development plans may include preclinical performance testing utilizing benchtop evaluation, animal models and human tissue samples; design validation in actual or simulated use with test subjects, clinicians or end users; and secondary analysis of physiologic data and metadata from existing clinical studies. a systems approach based on technical characteristics and intended clinical use of a proposed biodevice must be applied to product development and performance testing. performance evaluation should consider testing individual biodevice components and the whole system with respect to biocompatibility, shelf-life stability, mechanical and structural integrity, electromagnetic compatibility, electrical safety, power-cell safety and performance, survivability of the oral environment, cybersecurity, interoperability, usability, biofouling, and any other criteria needed to achieve acceptable performance in the target clinical application.adoption of human-factors-engineering and usability-engineering principles need be considered in the development process to ensure that a desired device performance is maximized within the oral environment for the intended use. implementation of risk assessment and risk management strategies must be considered to reduce design-related problems and potential human safety concerns. a rationale for use must be provided by defining situations in which the proposed intraoral biodevice would provide greater capabilities and quality of care than would be possible with a wearable device outside the oral cavity. usability criteria such as comfort, discreetness, interference with daily functions of the oral cavity and injury prevention to intraoral tissues must be considered to ensure device safety, and user acceptance and compliance.for any studies proposing the development of
