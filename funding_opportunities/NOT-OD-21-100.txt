(sgmro)office of research on women's health (orwh)this notice of special interest (nosi) is being issued by the nih adherence network through the office of behavioral and social sciences research (obssr) with participation from multiple nih institutes, centers, and offices. this nosi calls for research grant applications that address patient adherence to treatment and prevention regimens to promote health outcomes. applications may address healthcare regimen initiation, implementation, and/or persistence by patients. descriptive and intervention research may address adherence determinants at one or more levels of ecologic influence, including the patient, caregiver/family, provider, healthcare system, and community levels. the specific research interests of participating nih institutes and centers are detailed within.backgroundincreased adherence to recommended treatment and prevention regimens is an area of the behavioral and social sciences that promises substantial improvements in public health as well as savings in healthcare costs. poor adherence to healthcare regimens is common across many chronic illnesses and patient populations. this includes use of prescribed medications and many other recommended prevention, screening, treatment, monitoring, and health behavior regimens.current concepts of adherence are multidimensional. adherence to a specific health care behavior (e.g., taking a medicine, deciding to follow a diet, or making dietary changes) involves three dimensions: initiation (i.e., starting the recommended regimen), implementation (i.e., executing the schedule), and persistence (i.e., length of time on regimen before any discontinuation). each dimension of adherence may have unique determinants, and each may require distinct behavioral and social interventions.adherence behavior is dynamic with the potential to change over time. the dynamic nature of adherence underscores the need to improve routine monitoring of adherence to recommended healthcare regimens, to prompt the delivery of support interventions when needed.the determinants of adherence and non-adherence span a broad ecologic spectrum. these range across characteristics of the illness, the health care regimen, individual and social influences, and successively larger structural influences related to health care provision and health economics. multilevel adherence determinants invite a range of possible interventions that target individuals, families, caregivers, health-care providers, communities, and/or healthcare system factors. they also invite careful specification and assessment of the mechanisms of action when developing and testing adherence interventions.the next generation of research to address these adherence challenges will benefit from close attention to scientific rigor. studies should clearly define adherence, compliment self-reported measures with objective assessment of behavior, and address intervention mechanisms of action. applications are encouraged to apply approaches and tools for assessment of behavioral mechanisms developed under the nih common fund’s science of behavior change (sobc) program (see https://osf.io/zp7b4).research objectivesthe objective of this nosi is to encourage research grant applications that address patient adherence to treatment and prevention regimens to promote health outcomes. applications may address healthcare regimen initiation, implementation, and/or persistence by patients. descriptive and intervention research may address adherence determinants at one or more levels of ecologic influence, including the patient, caregiver/family, provider, healthcare system, and community levels.research projects that could be addressed in response to this nosi include, but are not limited to, the following topics. further institute- and center-specific topics subsequently follow.ic specific application and submission information:applicants must select the ic and associated foa to use for submission of an application in response to this nosi. the selection must align with the ic requirements listed in order to be considered responsive to that foa. non-responsive applications will be withdrawn from consideration for this initiative. in addition, applicants using nih parent announcements (listed below) will be assigned to those ics on this nosi that have indicated those foas are acceptable and based on usual application-ic assignment practices.national cancer institute (nci)nci seeks research that will improve adherence to recommended cancer prevention and treatment regimens in order to reduce cancer risk, improve treatment outcomes, and lower cancer-related morbidity, mortality, and disability. multi-level studies and research aimed at

(nimhd) is interested in supporting research and interventions considering determinants from more than one domain or level of influence (see nimhd research framework). intervention design should be based on theories from minority health and health disparities science. research must focus on one or more minority or health disparity population (african americans/blacks, hispanics/latinos, american indians/alaska natives, asians, native hawaiians and other pacific islanders, socioeconomically disadvantaged populations, underserved rural populations, and sexual and gender minority populations). applications may include but are not limited to multi-disciplinary etiologic and intervention research projects in community settings that advance the understanding of the mechanisms, pathways, and processes related to adherence to health promotion behaviors (e.g., healthy eating, physical activity, safe infant sleep practices, etc.), preventive screening recommendations, medication or other medical treatment regimens, and/or chronic disease self-management strategies. research may propose using available secondary data, health system data and/or collection of primary data. projects focused on patient-clinician communications, shared decision making, or other interactions, processes or services that occur within healthcare settings are not a priority for this nosi but should instead be submitted to par-20-310, health services research on minority health and health disparities (r01 clinical trial optional) or par-19-093, leveraging health information technology (health it) to address minority health and health disparities (r01 clinical trial optional).nimhd foas for this nosi include the following or their subsequent reissued equivalents:activity codefoafirst available

(ninr)ninr supports research that can build the scientific foundation for clinical practice, prevent disease and disability, manage and eliminate symptoms caused by illness, and enhance end-of-life and palliative care. in the context of this nosi, research areas of relevance include, but are not limited to: interventions that consider social ecological models that influence adherent behaviors; studies to understand gaps in adherence to national guidelines that promote healthy lifestyles and preventive behaviors; and secondary data analysis to identify moderators of evidence-based intervention strategies and that can inform new approaches to adherence research. studies that focus on health disparity populations are of particular interest.ninr foas for this nosi include the
