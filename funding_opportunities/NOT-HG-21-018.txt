some assays only indirectly measure the feature or function of interest; and many of the assays are complex to perform and implement, increasing the barriers to uptake. we remain far from consistently achieving direct measurements, precision, high quality, low costs, and rapid time to results needed to use comprehensive genomic information in many research applications and in individual health care.applicants are expected to work with the coordinating center nhgri is establishing to accelerate technology development and progress in the field of genomics via rfa-hg-20-019). this includes attending and actively participating in a yearly grantee meeting to accelerate progress in the field. at that meeting, substantial information sharing will be expected as appropriate and consistent with achieving the goals of the genome technology program (gtp). intellectual property concerns will need to be managed appropriately in the context of these meetings and for other opportunities for information sharing. grantees should also plan to work with the coordinating center as needed to assist in achieving the goals of this nosi and the gtp, including collaborating to synthesize findings and disseminate advances, developing and promoting standards for genomic technologies, and facilitating technology transfer to research and clinical utilization, as appropriateresearch proposed in response to this nosi should be generalizable, comprehensive, high-throughput and genome-scale. in some cases of very novel or new technologies, they may initially be developed at less than genome-scale as a proof of concept. in those circumstances, a justification should be given as to why the assay is an important area of interest at the pilot scale, along with a proposal for the potential to scale to genome-wide approaches.some examples of possible research topics are:application and submission informationthis notice applies to due dates on or after february 5, 2021 and subsequent receipt dates of current and reissued foas through january 10, 2024.applications for this initiative must be submitted using any of the following funding opportunity announcements (foa) or any reissues of these announcements through the expiration date of this notice:pa-20-185 - nih research project grant (parent r01 clinical trial not allowed)pa-20-195 - nih exploratory/developmental research grant program (parent r21 clinical trial not allowed)pa-20-260 - phs 2020 omnibus solicitation of the nih, cdc and fda for small business innovation research grant applications (parent sbir [r43/r44] clinical trial not allowed)pa-19-270 - phs 2019-02 omnibus solicitation of the nih for small business technology transfer grant applications (parent sttr [r41/r42] clinical trial not allowed)applicants are encouraged to contact nhgri staff early in the application process, and also to review the nhgri guidance to potential applicants for nhgri support: https://www.genome.gov/research-funding/funding-opportunities/guidance.all instructions in the sf424 (r&r) application guide and the funding opportunity announcement used for submission must be followed, with the following additions:applications nonresponsive to terms of this nosi will not be considered for the nosi initiative.scientific/research contact(s)stephanie a. morris, ph.d.national human genome research institute (nhgri)telephone: 301-435-5738email: morriss2@mail.nih.govpeer review contact(s)examine your era commons account for review assignment and contact information (information appears two weeks after the submission due date).financial/grants management contact(s)monika christmannational human genome research institute (nhgri)telephone: 301-435-7860email: christmm@exchange.nih.govweekly toc for this announcement nih funding opportunities and noticesnote: for help accessing pdf, rtf, ms word, excel, powerpoint, audio or video files, see help downloading files.
