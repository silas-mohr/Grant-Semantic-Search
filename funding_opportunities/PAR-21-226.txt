this foa or in a notice from the nih guide for grants and contracts). conformance to all requirements (both in the application guide and the foa) is required and strictly enforced. applicants must read and follow all application instructions in the application guide as well as any program-specific instructions noted in section iv. when the program-specific instructions deviate from those in the application guide, follow the program-specific instructions. applications that do not comply with these instructions may be delayed or not accepted for review.there are several options available to submit your application through grants.gov to nih and department of health and human services partners. you must use one of these submission options to access the application forms for this opportunity.many nih-funded research projects rely on vertebrate and invertebrate animal models to study the basics of biology and physiology, to investigate pathological conditions, to examine disease mechanisms and treatments, and to design novel therapies and translational procedures. in this regard, orip plays a vital role through its support of research infrastructures and animal models of human diseases.with this foa, orip encourages applications from small business concerns (sbcs) for small business technology transfer (sttr) projects to develop and implement novel tools and devices to improve animal welfare, to ease the management of individual animals and animal colonies, and to improve the monitoring and control of environmental conditions (e.g., temperature, humidity, vibrations, and ultrasonic noise) which affect outcomes and reproducibility in animal model research.poor reproducibility of experiments that use animal models has negatively impacted biomedical research for many decades. the difficulty of improving reproducibility can be realized when considering the broad range of intrinsic factors (e.g., age, species, health status, and sex) and extrinsic factors (e.g., climate, illumination, physical restraints, odors, and noise) that can affect the physiological and biological response of animals.the variation of extrinsic factors between different animal facilities has been cited as a source of irreproducibility in animal research. often, different laboratory animals require different environmental conditions for their optimal growth and well-being. also, the amount and type of pathogens, or pollutants in a facility can influence the physiological response and welfare of animals. even small differences in the handling and diets of animals can affect their physiological response. accurate accounting for and monitoring of these factors can reduce variations between experiments and lead to improvements in animal model validations and translatability to human studies.to consistently maintain an optimal environment for research animals, there is a need for devices in animal facilities that can precisely and accurately monitor the environmental conditions, especially those that are challenging to account for such as humidity, vibrations, odors, and ultrasonic noise. ideally, these devices will facilitate innovative and efficient operational procedures that utilize novel and green technologies to control and optimize the environmental conditions in animal facilities.devices that can sensitively identify types and levels of various pathogens, allergens, and/or other pollutants are especially desired in environments supporting laboratory animals. the level and type of infectious agents and other contaminants are factors that often contribute to differences in the physiological response between animals in different colonies or animal research facilities. these factors are especially hard to account for when comparing and monitoring species in the same and/or different geographical locations.additionally, needed are noninvasive or minimally invasive bio-logging devices for real-time monitoring of the behavior, food/water consumption, and bodily functions of animals. such devices should be discreet, robust, easy to apply, and mobile, while being sensitive enough to register the physiology of different animals. not only should these devices aid in the study and management of individual animals or entire colonies, but they should also lead to improvements in the performance of research protocols and data analysis. to implement such goals, there is a simultaneous need for new software that can combine data from different types of monitoring devices while being compatible with different data formats and linkable to existing databases.novel devices and tools are also needed to help ease the process of handling and restraining of animals. these devices should reduce the stress to both the animals and researcher; stress is an experimental variable and must be minimized. importantly, these devices should bring improvements in the efficiency of animal-handling practices and experimental procedures.connecting diet, environmental conditions, and physiological measurements will provide a global picture of the health and life-history of individual animals and colonies. properly accounting for these factors will further help to understand the effects of extrinsic factors on experimental outcomes.innovation is an important component of productive engineering efforts; however, new ideas are not a sufficient factor for designing and building a useful tool or device. the concept of innovation in the context of engineering endeavors and non-hypothesis driven research should be understood broadly. for example, a technology which is well established in one field and adapted to a different field may open new research areas, enable novel research projects, improve experimental procedures, and have a wider impact than its original scope.these efforts are important for a broad class of animal models, including but not limited to widely used model organisms such as fruit fly, worm, mouse, rat, zebrafish, frog, rabbit, swine, and nonhuman primates amongst others. we emphasize that this foa applies to invertebrate and vertebrate animals.disease-specific devices are not covered under this foa (e.g., glucose monitors, brain probes for specific neurological conditions, or cancer imaging tools). nor are reagents and experimental protocols appropriate for this foa.the development and implementation of novel tools and devices, and enhancement of existing equipment includes, but are not limited to, the following specific examples:applicants are advised to discuss their projects with the scientific/research contacts before submitting an application.see section viii. other information for award authorities and regulations.grant: a support mechanism

the hhs sbir/sttr program is implementing the phase i to phase ii transition rate benchmark required by the sbir/sttr reauthorization act of 2011 and the sbir and sttr extension act of 2022. the benchmark establishes a minimum number of phase ii awards the company must have received relative to a given number of phase i awards received during the 5-fiscal year time period. the transition rate is calculated as the total number of sbir and sttr phase ii awards a company received during the past 5 fiscal years divided by the total number of sbir and sttr phase i awards it received during the past 5 fiscal years excluding the most recently-completed year. the transition rate requirement, agreed upon and established by all 11 sbir agencies, was published for public comment in a federal register notice on october 16, 2012 (77 fr 63410) and amended on may 23, 2013 (78 fr 30951).on june 1 of each year, sba will identify the companies that fail to meet minimum performance requirements.sba calculates individual company phase i to phase ii transition rates using sbir and sttr award information across all federal agencies. sba will notify companies and the relevant officials at the participating agencies. more information on the phase i to phase ii transition rate requirement is available at sbir.gov.phase ii to commercialization benchmark: in accordance with guidance from the sba, the hhs sbir/sttr programs are implementing the phase ii to commercialization rate benchmark for phase i applicants, as required by the sbir/sttr reauthorization act of 2011 and the sbir and sttr extension act of 2022. the commercialization rate benchmark was published in a federal register notice on august 8, 2013 (78 fr 48537), with a reopening of the comment period published on september 26, 2013 (78 fr 59410).non-domestic (non-u.s.) entities (foreign institutions) are not eligible to apply.non-domestic (non-u.s.) components of u.s. organizations are not
