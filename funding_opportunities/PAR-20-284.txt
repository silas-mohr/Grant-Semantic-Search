you must use one of these submission options to access the application forms for this opportunity.purposethe purpose of this funding opportunity announcement (foa) entitled "innovative research in cancer nanotechnology (ircn)" is to expand the fundamental understanding of the processes pertinent to the use of nanotechnology in cancer. the goal of ircn projects is to conduct mechanistic studies and generate new fundamental knowledge associated with the development of nanotechnology-based solutions to major problems in cancer biology and/or oncology. ircn awards are expected to produce fundamental knowledge to aid future and more informed development of practical nanotechnology-based cancer interventions (although prospective clinical translation of the ircn findings remains beyond the scope of this foa). projects supported by the ircn initiative will incorporate multi-disciplinary research in biology/oncology, chemistry, physics, and/or engineering.nanotechnology in the context of this foa. to be responsive to this foa, the proposed nanotechnology approaches, materials, devices, and technologies should meet the following criteria:backgroundpotential of nanotechnology in cancer research and oncology. significant progress has been made in the synthesis and characterization of engineered nanoparticles and nano-devices for diagnosis and treatment of cancers and a few cancer nanotechnology strategies have already moved into clinical trials and obtained fda approval. however, these strategies produced only modest improvement in treatment efficacy and/or early diagnosis capabilities. in order to improve the effectiveness of nanotechnology-based cancer interventions and gain their broader acceptance, further systematic and mechanistic studies on a fundamental understanding of nanomaterial and/or nanodevice interactions with biological systems are needed.nci has been supporting the development of nanotechnology for cancer prevention, diagnosis, and treatment using a wide range of funding mechanisms (http://nano.cancer.gov). the information on general areas of research interest and status of these activities can be found in the following documents:it is recognized that further investigations into the fundamental understanding of interactions between nanoparticles and/or nano-devices and biological systems are a key to informed and successful technology translation.research objectives for ircn awardsgeneral expectations for ircn projects. ircn awards are expected to advance employment of nanotechnology in understanding, diagnosing, and treating neoplastic diseases. each proposed ircn project is expected to generate new fundamental knowledge aiding the development of nanotechnology-based solutions to major problems in cancer biology and/or oncology. typical efforts and applications in this area of research involve 1) demonstration of therapies based on nanoparticle delivery with the attempt to obtain improved efficacy and 2) demonstration of diagnostic tools (in vitro or in vivo) with improved sensitivity and specificity. these are clearly important objectives, but it is often that the above goals can be accomplished without a full understanding of the therapeutic mode of action or insight into mechanisms contributing to improved sensitivity and specificity of diagnostics. projects submitted to this foa need to be designed differently. while proposing an innovative, nanotechnology-based solution to cancer biology and/or oncology problems, the project should focus on mechanistic studies. these studies are expected to address the fundamental understanding of nanomaterial and/or nano-device interactions with biological systems in the effort to uncover mechanisms governing effective delivery of nanoparticles and/or nano-devices to desired and intended cancer targets in vivo and/or successful operation of detection and diagnostic devices and sensors in vitro. the innovative use of nanotechnology to solve cancer biology/oncology problems is viewed as more significant than innovation in nanotechnology itself (e.g., development of new nanomaterials).possible research directions. examples of appropriate research areas are listed below. these examples are not meant to be comprehensive. additional research foci are also encouraged, providing they are consistent with the general expectations stated above.tumor types. all ircn applicants are expected to concentrate their proposed efforts on one or two rationally selected tumor types. for this foa, a "tumor type" refers to either tumors of a specific tissue of origin or tumors with critical abnormalities in a particular molecular pathway(s) shared in cancers arising from a variety of tissues.annual principal investigators' meetingnci holds an annual meeting of investigators funded through the institute's nanotechnology programs with the purpose of sharing research progress and establishing collaborations.
