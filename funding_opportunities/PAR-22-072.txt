analysis of those measures are necessary. much of the focus to date on measures and methods for health disparities has been on determining the presence and magnitude of disparities or validating and assessing individual-level social determinants of health. what is needed are measures that can better capture social disadvantage. for example, what is needed are measures and methods for constructs that reflect a complex interplay of cultural, social, and environmental factors that shape an individual’s or population’s lived experience and their impact on health behaviors and outcomes. in particular, methodological approaches are needed to best assess health determinants beyond the individual level, including those at the interpersonal, family, organizational, neighborhood, community, and societal levels (see https://www.nimhd.nih.gov/about/overview/research-framework/nimhd-framework.html) as well as methods that integrate health determinants across levels. with the increasing recognition of the importance of incorporating a life course perspective into health disparities research, there is a corresponding need for measures and methods that assess cumulative risk and resilience over time for individuals and population groups. an additional area for measurement and methods development is related to intersectionality, specifically understanding the lived experience and health impacts of belonging to more than one socially disadvantaged or marginalized population. across these areas of particular importance is understanding the scientific utility of using comprehensive, granular measures (e.g., assessing every dimension of a construct or every occurrence of a specific phenomenon) versus more global, holistic measures with respect to the usefulness of information they produce, the usability of the data, resources required to analyze them, respondent acceptability and burden, and population relevance. methods of data collection that are accessible and suitable for populations that experience health disparities are needed as are methods for analysis of measures collected at multiple levels.research objectivesthis initiative will support research to improve the measures and methods for complex social constructs that capture the lived experience of populations that experience health disparities. the nih-designated u.s. populations with health disparities are racial and ethnic minority groups, sexual and gender minority groups, underserved rural populations, and socioeconomically disadvantaged populations of any race or ethnicity (https://www.nimhd.nih.gov/about/overview/).the objective of this initiative is to produce knowledge that can inform the field about the types of measurement approaches that may be most suitable for different health disparities-related research questions or specific populations, settings, or contexts. projects are expected to examine the performance and utility of specific measurement and/or methodological approaches. projects that simply use new or existing measures or methods to answer health disparities-related research questions, without examining their performance or utility, are not responsive to this foa. projects are encouraged to use multiple data sources across different levels and across multiple sectors when appropriate. however, because this initiative emphasizes capturing the lived experiences of individuals and populations, all projects are expected to include self-report measures or data in some way. projects should also include relevant diversity (e.g., with respect to age, gender, race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, sexual or gender minority status, and/or geographic region) in sampling, enrollment, and data analysis needed to advance health disparities and health equity research and interventions development.examples of potential study designs include but are not limited to the following:areas of research interestthe mission of the national eye institute (www.nei.nih.gov) is to eliminate vision loss and improve quality of life through vision research. the nei supports basic and clinical research into diseases and disorders of the visual system and the special needs of people with impaired vision or who are blind. the nei encourages innovative applications that will advance innovative development of new measures and methods, or testing and adaptation of existing measures and approaches, to address health disparities and health inequities in the prevention, diagnosis, treatment and management of eye and vision conditions.nimhd’s interests include, but are not limited to, the following:national cancer institutethe national cancer institute seeks applications that advance innovative development of new

of interest may include:national institute of environmental health sciencesthe mission of the national institute of environmental health sciences (niehs) is to discover how the environment affects people to promote healthier lives. the niehs seeks applications that advance innovative development of new measures and methods, or validation and adaptation of existing measures and approaches, to address the complex interplay of the physical, chemical, cultural, social, and built environmental factors that contribute to or exacerbate environmental health disparities. applications of interest may include, but are not limited to:national institute of dental and craniofacial researchnidcr is interested in funding research that will advance measurement, analysis, and monitoring of social determinants of health that contribute to dental, oral, and craniofacial (doc) health disparities and inequities within the u.s. population over time and across settings. to this end, nidcr will support research to examine the performance and utility of measures and methodologic approaches to improve the measurement and assessment of social determinants of doc health. specific areas of research interest include but are not limited to:national institute of mental healthnimh encourages research that addresses institute priorities and is aligned with these recommended areas for domestic and global mental health research. applicants may consider using the research domain criteria (rdoc; https://www.nimh.nih.gov/research/research-funded-by-nimh/rdoc) approach in their work. areas of interest include, but are not limited to:• applications on advancing methods for analyzing complex and dynamic systems that impact mental health disparities, including research on methods for estimating non-linear, dynamic, and time-varying relationships between sdoh and disparities in mental health service use, delivery and outcomes.• research on advancing methods for multilevel models examining mutable factors associated with disparities in mental health service use, delivery, and outcomes.• applications developing and/or refining methods for adequately powered analyses of mental health disparities experienced by smaller groups or subpopulations (e.g., when addressing intersectionality, conducting subgroup analyses) and low base rate mental health events (e.g., suicide deaths).• research to develop and validate measures and methods for expanding data capacity to appropriately represent disparities populations, incorporate sdoh, and reduce algorithmic bias in artificial intelligence and machine learning approaches for understanding risk and optimizing mental health care for populations with mental health disparities.• research to develop and validate measures and methods for integration of sdoh in health care decision-making processes and examine the impact of such integration on reducing disparities and achieving equity in mental health services outcomes.• research to develop or refine causal inference methods within quasi-experimental designs (e.g. general causal model, directed acyclic graphs, deterministic structural equation models, probabilistic causal models, instrumental variables), to address research questions addressing mental health equity for mental health disparity populations.• research to develop measures of quality of mental health care for mental health disparity populations.• development and validation of mental health measures that can be submitted to and endorsed by the national quality forum (https://www.qualityforum.org/map/) for use to advance equity and quality in mental health care as part of the healthcare effectiveness data and information set (hedis; https://www.cms.gov/medicare/health-plans/specialneedsplans/snp-hedis) or as a quality indicator for the centers for medicare and medicaid services (https://www.cms.gov/).• metrics that elucidate mechanisms at the individual, community, and organizational levels that result in disparities in specific adverse mental health outcomes across the lifespan, especially those that can point towards therapeutic targets.• assessments of how structural racism and discrimination impact trajectories of mental health disorders across the lifespan, particularly focusing on sequential and integrative relationships across neural, behavioral, and environmental factors that lead to disparities in mental health outcomes.• measures that systematically and reliably quantify individual exposure to factors that drive mental health disparities, including rigorous, lifestage-appropriate, and repeatable measures of environmental and sociocultural factors like neighborhood effects, access to and quality of healthcare, food and resource security, intersectionality, and cultural beliefs.• research on measures and approaches to be used in basic studies in healthy populations of interest addressing mechanisms of complex social, cognitive, affective and behavioral functioning.national institute on aging (nia)nia supports research to understand health differences and health inequities associated with race, ethnicity, gender, environment, socioeconomic status (ses), geography, access, and sociocultural factors over the life course and their impact on aging processes, and aging-relevant outcomes including alzheimer’s disease and alzheimer’s disease related dementias (ad/adrd). the goals of this initiative are to (1) identify the environmental, social, cultural, and behavioral factors that drive disparities in health, well-being, healthcare, and mortality; and (2) develop strategies to reduce or eliminate those disparities and promote active life expectancy and improve the health status of diverse midlife and older adults. nia's health disparities research framework reflects levels of analysis researchers might consider across each of the four domains, refines the causal pathways, and further refines potentially adaptable targets for interventions. additionally, the framework reflects priorities and investments made in this important aging research area. the framework could also facilitate researchers identifying relevant expertise needed to expand their team and ultimately accomplish the proposed study’s goals and objectives.nia’s interests in par-22-072, “measures and methods to advance research on minority health and health disparities-related constructs” include, but are not limited to, development of, or enhancements to, measures or

principal investigator’s scientific interest, funding limitations, recruitment requirements, and other considerations. thus, criteria in research protocols that target or exclude certain populations are warranted where nondiscriminatory justifications establish that such criteria are appropriate with respect to the health or safety of the subjects, the scientific study design, or the purpose of the research. for additional guidance regarding how the provisions apply to nih grant programs, please contact the scientific/research contact that is identified in section vii under agency contacts of this foa.please contact the hhs office for civil rights for more information about obligations and prohibitions under federal civil rights laws at
