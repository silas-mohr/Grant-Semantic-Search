national institutes of health (nih)national center for advancing translational sciences (ncats)r03 small grant programsee section iii. 3. additional information on eligibility.the purpose of this foa is to enhance the capability of ncats ctsa program kl2 scholars and recipients of diversity and re-entry supplements supported by the ctsa program to conduct research as they complete the transition to fully independent academic translational scientists.these r03 grants will support different clinical and translational science research projects, including pilot and feasibility studies; secondary data analysis of existing data; small, self-contained research projects; development of research methodology; and development of new research technology. research proposed in the r03 application may or may not include patient-oriented research. the r03 is, therefore, intended to support research projects that can be carried out in a short period of time with limited resources and that provide preliminary data to support submission of a subsequent r01, or equivalent, application.february 26, 2021all applications are due by 5:00 pm local time of applicant organization. all types of non-aids applications allowed for this funding opportunity announcement are due on the listed date(s).applicants are encouraged to apply early to allow adequate time to make any corrections to errors found in the application during the submission process by the due date.not applicableit is critical that applicants follow the instructions in the research (r) instructions in the sf424 (r&r) application guide,except where instructed to do otherwise (in this foa or in a notice from nih guide for grants and contracts ).conformance to all requirements (both in the application guide and the foa) is required and strictly enforced. applicants must read and follow all application instructions in the application guide as well as any program-specific instructions noted in section iv. when the program-specific instructions deviate from those in the application guide, follow the program-specific instructions.applications that do not comply with these instructions may be delayed or not accepted for review.there are several options available to submit your application through grants.gov to nih and department of health and human services partners. you must use one of these submission options to access the application forms for this opportunity.backgroundthe national center for advancing translational sciences (ncats) at the national institutes of health (nih), is transforming the translational science process so that new treatments and cures for disease can be delivered to patients faster. ncats strives to develop innovations to reduce, remove or bypass costly and time-consuming bottlenecks in the translational research pipeline in an effort to speed the delivery of new drugs, diagnostics and medical devices to patients. translation is the process of turning observations in the laboratory, clinic and community into interventions that improve the health of individuals and the public — from diagnostics and therapeutics to medical procedures and behavioral changes. translational science is the field of investigation focused on understanding the scientific and operational principles underlying each step of the translational process. ncats studies translation on a system-wide level as a scientific and operational problem. the ncats approach is not to focus on specific diseases, but on what is common among them and the translational science process by developing new approaches, technologies, resources, and models; demonstrating their usefulness; and disseminating the data, analysis and methodologies to the community.the overarching goal of the ncats clinical and translational science awards (ctsa) program is to develop innovative solutions that will improve the efficiency, quality and impact of the process for turning observations in the laboratory, clinic and community into interventions that improve the health of individuals and the public. small research grants are expected to support small self-contained research projects to be carried out in a short period of time with limited resources that are expected to 1) address a general roadblock in science and/or operations that limits the efficiency and effectiveness of translation; 2) develop, demonstrate, and/or disseminate innovative solutions and/or new or better treatments that will have an impact on improving the health of patients; and 3) support the transition of clinical and translational scientists to fully independent academic translational scientists by enabling them to acquire sufficient preliminary data and information for subsequent research applications. there is not an expectation that this r03 project will likely "move the field forward" at this stage.purposethis funding opportunity announcement (foa) supports applications for the ncats ctsa program small grant program (r03) from ncats ctsa program kl2 scholars and supplement recipients supported directly by the ctsa program. applications must be submitted for r03 due dates within 2 years of completion of the kl2 appointment or research supplement. eligibility details are described below (section iii. eligibility information).by providing this funding, the ncats ctsa program intends to foster the successful development of the next generation of clinical and translational science leaders trying to launch their independent research careers by augmenting previous investments. this grant support by the ctsa program is expected to have the following benefits:projects supported under this foa may include, but are not limited to:examples include, but are not limited to:non-responsive applicationsthe following will be considered non-responsive. non-responsive applications will not be reviewed.clinical trials restrictionas detailed in not-tr-18-025, ncats is limited to direct support of clinical trials through phase iib with the exception of phase iii (21 cfr definition) clinical trials for treatment of a rare disease or condition.design, analysis, and sample size for studies to evaluate group-based interventions: investigators who wish to evaluate the effect of an intervention on a health-related biomedical or behavioral outcome may propose a study in which (1) groups or clusters are assigned to study arms and individual observations are analyzed to evaluate the effect of the intervention, or (2) participants are assigned individually to study arms but receive at least some of their intervention in a real or virtual group or through a shared facilitator. such studies may propose a parallel group- or cluster-randomized trial, an individually randomized group-treatment trial, a stepped-wedge design, or a quasi-experimental version of one of these designs. in these studies, special methods may be warranted for analysis and sample size estimation. applicants should show that their methods are appropriate given their plans for assignment of participants and delivery of interventions. additional information is available at

applications submitted to the nih in support of the nih mission are evaluated for scientific and technical merit through the nih peer review system.for this particular announcement, note the following:the r03 small grant supports discrete, well-defined projects that realistically can be completed in two years and that require limited levels of funding. because the research project usually is limited, an r03 grant application may not contain extensive detail or discussion. accordingly, reviewers should evaluate the conceptual framework and general approach to the problem. appropriate justification for the proposed work can be provided through literature citations, data from other sources, or from investigator-generated data. preliminary data are not required, particularly in applications proposing pilot or feasibility studies.in addition, for applications involving clinical trials:a proposed clinical trial application may include study design, methods, and intervention that are not by themselves innovative but address important questions or unmet needs. additionally, the results of the clinical trial may indicate that further clinical development of the intervention is unwarranted or lead to new avenues of scientific investigation.reviewers will provide an overall impact score to reflect their assessment of the likelihood for the project to exert a sustained, powerful influence on the research field(s) involved, in consideration of the following review criteria and additional review criteria (as applicable for the project proposed).reviewers will consider each of the review criteria below in the determination of scientific merit, and give a separate score for each. an application does not need to be strong in all categories to be judged likely to have
