health (nccih)national center for advancing translational sciences (ncats)sexual and gender minority research office (sgmro)national cancer institute (nci)obssr is interested in supporting the integration of health-related behavioral and social sciences (bss) with other biomedical methodological and scientific disciplines (e.g., genetics, immunology, metabolomics, molecular biology, microbiome, biochemistry, or physiological sciences). the goal is to train a research workforce that has the integrated content expertise and skills to meaningful address gaps in scientific advancement that are not well served by a more siloed approach to research. to support this goal, the obssr is soliciting applications for a one year administrative supplement to existing nih t32 and tl1 training grants for the addition of activities that support the acquisition of expertise and skills that are foundational to conducting multidisciplinary science that integrates bss with biomedical approaches, methods, paradigms, and outcomes. activities may be designed to better prepare students for multi-disciplinary research careers in a variety of venues, such as academia, industry, government, or entrepreneurial enterprises. applicants are encouraged to develop activities that can be easily shared with other training programs. applicants can respond to this announcement by adding curricula from biomedical disciplines to t32s and tl1s that are primarily focused on bss or by adding bss curricula to t32s and tl1s that are primarily focused on biomedical sciences. the aims of the administrative supplement activities should be to support t32 or tl1 training to develop skills and expertise in integrated and multidisciplinary research that includes bss. applicants should discuss how the training module will increase interest in the t32/tl1, and how the training module will impact trainee careers. the cross-discipline curricula added to a t32 or tl1 could focus on training in discipline-specific methods, measurement approaches, research paradigms, and/or discipline specific subject matter expertise.applicants should note that this nosi provides an opportunity to request only one year of support, and the funds from this supplement must be expended during the 12-month budget period of the award. some nih institutes may have restrictions on the year in which the award can be made, so please consult with the program officer on your parent grant.application budgets are limited to no more than $100,000 direct costs (unless the cost of the parent grant is less than $100,000 at which point the request cannot exceed the cost of the parent grant) and must reflect the actual needs of the proposed project. the proposed project period cannot exceed that of the parent award. as noted in pa-20-272, administrative supplements in response to this nosi, “can be used to cover cost increases that are associated with achieving certain new research objectives, as long as the research objectives are within the original scope of the peer reviewed and approved project, or the cost increases are for unanticipated expenses within the original scope of the project. any cost increases need to result from making modifications to the project that would increase or preserve the overall impact of the project consistent with its originally approved objectives and purposes.”applicants should also note that funds from this supplement should support added curricula development and implementation and are not intended to support additional trainee slots. some of the budget can support faculty salaries but only to the extent necessary for the development and implementation of curricula.activities supported by this nosi may vary by the nih institute funding the parent award. please see institute-specific interests below.applicant organizations may submit more than one application to this nosi, provided that each is sufficiently distinct from any other administrative supplement currently under consideration by the awarding nih institute or center. however, only one supplement request per parent award will be accepted.ncats supports predoctoral and postdoctoral training through the clinical and translational science award (ctsa) program - ruth l. kirschstein national research service award (tl1/t32). the goal of the nrsa training program at ncats is to train the next generation of the clinical and translational science workforce that improves the efficiency, quality and impact of the process for turning observations in the laboratory, clinic and community into interventions that improve the health of individuals and the public. note about the award project period: supplement project and budget periods are limited to the remaining active budget period that started in fy23 for the existing parent award. to be eligible, the parent award must be active (i.e., not be in an extension period), and the activities proposed in the supplement must be accomplished within the remaining active budget period that started in fy23 for the existing parent award.the nci is interested in curricula/training opportunities to enhance (1) statistical and methodological methods, and (2) capacity of researchers to advance priority areas by fostering the integration of cancer prevention and control and biomedical research. examples include, but are not limited to, (a) geospatial thinking and analysis, (b) computational modeling and/or data science methods to understand the predictors, mediators and moderators of behavior including outcomes such as tobacco use, sedentary behavior, physical activity, sun safety, alcohol use, medication adherence and diet/nutrition, (c) multi-level models/theories that examine the effects of multiple and potentially interacting factors ranging from biology to the built environment and the impact of policy on behavior, and (d) training in newly established data collection efforts, including crowdsourcing and citizen science, wearables, sensors, smartphones and the internet. training in techniques to merge and/or link different data sets to answer novel cancer control-related research questions is also a priority.niams funds ruth l. kirschstein national research service award (nrsa) institutional research training grants (t32) to enable institutions to support pre-doctoral and postdoctoral research training for individuals in the fields of arthritis and musculoskeletal and skin diseases. the primary goal of the niams t32 program is to prepare individuals to pursue careers in research that will ultimately improve the health of persons with arthritis and musculoskeletal and skin diseases. niams is interested in applications that propose to integrate transdisciplinary training in the behavioral and social sciences, with the goal of increasing the number of future investigators with content area expertise and skills in best practice designs, measurements, and analytic methods of behavioral and social sciencedescription of circumstances for which administrative supplements are available.application and submission informationapplications for this initiative must be submitted using the following opportunity or its subsequent reissued equivalent.all instructions in the sf424 (r&r) application guide and pa-20-272
