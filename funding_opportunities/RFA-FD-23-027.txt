for a nationally integrated food safety system (ifss) by supporting manufactured food regulatory program standards (mfrps), food protection task force (fptf) programs, dietary supplement (ds) programs, and special projects. for the purposes of this foa, the term state encompasses all eligible organizations as defined in section 3.mfrps development or maintenance:the purpose of this foa section is to advance efforts for a nationally integrated food safety system by assisting state manufactured food regulatory programs to achieve and maintain conformance with the most current version of the manufactured food regulatory program standards (mfrps). the mfrps are intended to ensure that state manufactured food regulatory programs implement a high-quality regulatory program through the development and maintenance of a regulatory framework that builds on and emphasizes mutual reliance with all programs. also, the program standards are intended to enhance food safety by establishing a uniform basis for measuring and improving the performance of manufactured food regulatory programs in the united states. conformance with these program standards will help federal and state programs better direct their regulatory activities at reducing foodborne illness hazards in plants that manufacture, process, pack, or hold foods.food protection task force (fptf):the purpose of this funding option is to establish and/or support a food protection task force (fptf) with diverse membership representative of stakeholders across the state that is responsible for promoting the integration of an efficient statewide human and animal food (haf) protection system that addresses state and region-specific needs and that maximize the protection of the public health. these efforts include: establishing a food safety/protection network of subject matter experts, fostering educational opportunities, developing replicable resources and systematically fostering communication, education, outreach, cooperation and collaboration within the states among federal, state, local, tribal and territorial haf protection, public health, agriculture, and regulatory agencies, industry, academia, and consumers to initiate and/or support haf protection activities to improve public health.a strong fptf can also help improve human and animal food emergency surveillance, response, and post-response systems by focusing on preparedness, building strong communication channels, and establishing relationships with key players before food-related incidents occur.dietary supplements:the goal of this funding option is to facilitate the development of state driven dietary supplement regulatory framework and programs. the overall objective of this funding opportunity is to advance the adoption and implementation of the cgmps for dietary supplements rule codified at 21 cfr part 111. specifically, this track will provide funding support for training and program development activities.special projects:the purpose of this funding option is to develop and implement special projects that support innovation and integration in a nationally integrated food safety system (ifss) using the mfrps framework. this track will support other emerging food safety priorities that develop over the lifespan of the project. state programs will be expected to share project deliverables and resources developed with other programs.january 24, 2023january 26, 2023march 14, 2023april 21, 2023, by 11:59 pm eastern timeapplicants are encouraged to apply early to allow adequate time to

the united states, federal and state government agencies ensure the safety of human and animal food. the food and drug administration (fda) is responsible for ensuring that all human and animal foods moving in interstate commerce, except those under the united states department of agriculture (usda) jurisdiction, are safe, wholesome, and labeled properly. state agencies are responsible for conducting inspections and regulatory activities that help ensure food produced, processed, and distributed within their jurisdictions are safe and in compliance with state laws and regulations. state agencies primarily perform inspections under their own regulatory authority. many state agencies conduct inspections of food facilities under contract with the fda. partnerships amongst fda and state regulatory authorities are important because jurisdictions often overlap and consistency in inspectional approach and capabilities enhances the ifss.the fda food safety modernization act (fsma) provides further support for developing an ifss. fsma was signed into law in january 2011 and calls for enhanced partnerships and integration with federal, state, local, tribal, and territorial partners. the enhanced partnerships and integration directed under the law allow fda to rely on inspections and data collected by other agencies, to support regulatory activities and further the build on the idea of an ifss.the current good manufacturing practice, hazard analysis, and risk-based preventive controls for human food regulation 21 cfr part 117 ('preventive controls rule') is intended to ensure safe manufacturing/processing, packing, and holding of food products for human consumption in the united states. implementation of preventive controls rule across state and territorial governments will help advance a risk-based vision of food safety.the manufactured food regulatory program standards (mfrps) allows for the development and maintenance of risk-based food safety programs by establishing a uniform basis for measuring and improving the performance of state manufactured food regulatory programs in the united states.for more information on the mfrps program, please visit http://www.fda.gov/forfederalstateandlocalofficials/programsinitiatives/regulatoryprgmstnds/ucm475064.htmfor the purpose of this funding opportunity, conformance means the fulfillment of a requirement of the mfrps specifically a state program is using and can demonstrate the use of a particular element, system, or program listed in the mfrps (most recent version).goals:although individual year outcomes may vary among programs, the overall goals of the work provided under this cooperative agreement are as follows:(1) recipients will achieve and maintain conformance with the mfrps (most recent version) which is recognized as a critical element to creating a national, fully integrated food safety system.(a) if conformance is not achieved by the conclusion of the cooperative agreement, the recipient will develop and implement a strategic improvement plan to reach conformance.(b) recipients will develop strategies and resources for achieving and maintaining conformance with the mfrps that can be shared and duplicated on a national basis including: performing self-assessments, participating with fda assessments/audits, identify continuous improvement projects as well as maintain an up to date strategic improvement plan.(2) recipient will provide fda the foundation for the improvement in quality of contracts, coordination of inspections, investigations and enforcement to effectively and efficiently protect public health to further the integrated food safety system (ifss).(a) recipients will contribute to the continuous improvement of the mfrps through attendance at an annual face-to-face meeting, active participation in committees, and other initiatives that contribute to the improvement in regulatory activities in the ifss.(b) recipient will maintain an fda inspectional contract in good standing by completing all agreed upon inspectional work, audits, and associated compliance and regulatory activities.(3) recipient will establish inspection and compliance programs which incorporates a regulatory framework and authority to facilitate the ifss, including engaging with fda to participate in work planning, work sharing, and data exchange efforts.(a) to facilitate this continued development of an ifss, fda and state personnel will meet as necessary to develop and monitor progress in work planning, work sharing, and data exchange efforts.(b) when discussing work planning, states and fda should consider the inspection frequency for both high risk and non-high-risk facilities as described in fsma section 201. best practices, such as those published by the partnership for food protection (pfp), may be used as a resource to guide these meetings.(4) recipients will identify and remedy gaps in agency infrastructure necessary to fully adopt and implement the preventive controls rule or statutory and/or regulatory authority with equivalent effect as a part of the manufactured food regulatory program.(a) infrastructure needs may include personnel, it, regulatory foundation, training, updating procedures and records, management programs, and laboratory.(b) the recipients should briefly describe their current status and evaluate existing statutory and/or regulatory authority related to the preventive controls rule. if needed, plans to research changes needed to incorporate the preventive controls rule or operate under fda authority should be described. applicants may also propose to evaluate other applicable fsma rules and determine if adoption or updating existing rules and regulations is necessary (e.g. intentional adulteration, sanitary transport, foreign supplier verification program, etc.). the updating of other regulations related to fsma rules may also require the updating procedures and policies to maintain conformance with the mfrps.(c) recipients are also encouraged to participate in pilot projects and develop capabilities to share regulatory data with fda through it platforms, such as the national food safety data exchange (nfsdx), as opportunities are available.(d) recipients should also propose how novel capabilities will be maintained after the conclusion of the project.(5) applicants must hold an information sharing agreement with the fda under 21 cfr 20.88 or be able to obtain an agreement prior to the start date of the award.(6) if recipients are a part of the laboratory flexible funding model (lffm) they will apply their mfrps response, enforcement and regulatory framework to conduct follow-up inspections, investigations (including traceback/forward), and enforcement actions (including embargos, recalls, warning letters, and closures) to positive and violative samples identified as part of the lffm cooperative agreement. coordination with the rapid response team (rrt) and activation, if applicable, is required for recipients also participate in that award (insert award number).(a) recipients will commit to coordinating response and compliance follow-up on lffm samples with the fda in real-time, to include sharing findings and compliance actions or other follow-up activities discussing regulatory/compliance strategy with the fda.(b) if a potentially violative lffm sample comes to a mfrps program but is outside of the mfrps program’s regulatory authority/jurisdiction, the mfrps program agrees to identify and notify the appropriate state/federal agencies with jurisdiction, and to notify the fda.(c) potentially violative lffm samples may come to the mfrps program from any laboratory participating in the lffm human food product testing track for microbiology or chemistry. this includes – samples collected by lffm laboratories within the same state as the mfrps program (may or may not be the primary servicing laboratory for mfrps); samples collected by other states/analyzed by other lffm laboratories where the potentially violative product is traced back to the mfrps program’s state.(d) recipients will collect samples at the manufacturer, and other locations, in accordance with the collection instructions for each hazard-commodity pair on the approved lffm sample plan, as needed.(e) recipients will build the necessary regulatory and compliance response infrastructure to investigate and respond to violative samples, including qualified personnel, it resources, and regulatory authorities.this optional track provides funding for the purpose of supporting activities of a food protection task force, as described in the coalition of food protection task forces best practices manual: https://web-dfsr.s3-us-gov-west-1.amazonaws.com/op/assets/file/fptf-best-practices-final-1-12-21-508-version.pdf.task forces shall establish and annually update a vision & mission statement, organizational governance documentation, and a logic model that depicts the task force’s focus, inputs, activities, outputs (measurable/quantifiable program activities), and outcomes (qualitative and tangible benefits).task forces focuses can include: 1) enhance partnerships in an integrated food safety system; 2) gather, analyze, and synthesize input on proposed laws and regulations; 3) educate stakeholders on new laws, rules, and regulations; 4) provide technical assistance; 5) educate consumers; 6) enhance human and animal food emergency response preparedness; 7) discuss food safety issues related to emerging food trends; and 8) promote implementation of intervention strategies.for applicants that do not currently operate or fund food protection task force(s) within their jurisdiction, objectives relating to the fptf project can be accomplished via subaward to active task force(s) within their jurisdiction.encouraged activities:yearly goals for fptf:1) convene at least one task force meeting each year with the explicit purpose of informing, educating, and soliciting input from external stakeholders on items relevant to executing an effective integrated food safety system at all levels within the respective state.2) convene at least one governance meeting with diverse membership to update the vision & mission statement, organizational governance documentation, and the logic model depicting the focus and measurable impact of the food protection task force.3) annually report quantified metrics and measurements demonstrating the various integration and task force activities conducted by the task force directly and as an indirect result of the task force to demonstrate overall impact of this funding track.4) submit copies of fptf presentations, job aids, educational resources and other materials developed in part by this funding to the office of partnerships annually.fda views state-based food protection task forces as an important mechanism for providing food protection program coordination and information exchange within each state and this should be evidenced through recipient reporting of metrics and measurable impact.objectives:the overall objective of this funding opportunity is to advance the adoption and implementation of the cgmps for dietary supplements rule codified at 21 cfr part 111. this objective is classified into several broad activities to enhance and support cgmps for dietary supplements rule implementation:training:technical training in the scientific basis, procedures, and legal requirements of the cgmps for dietary supplements rule allows for the equivalent and consistent application of the cgmps for dietary supplements rule across the united states. the program training plan (as required by the mfrps) must be updated to include dietary supplement coursework and field training for inspectors engaging in these types of inspections. the state program training plan for dietary supplements should satisfy the training elements in the mfrps. the training plan will provide a foundation for evidence collection and development, and data acceptability for dietary supplement inspections. an evaluation of the program training plan using data from inspections, samples, and regulatory actions should be performed to determine if the training program needs to be updated to support advisory/regulatory action under your own authorities or by fda, when necessary. the program should consult with their assigned fda division staff, as appropriate when conducting the evaluation and shall identify and document any improvements (such as updates, modifications, or additions) to the program training plan that are needed to promote evidence collection and support possible regulatory actions. the training required for conducting environmental and product sampling to support dietary supplement inspections should also be incorporated into the training program, as appropriate. fully trained staff should conduct a minimum of 3 - 5 dietary supplement inspections annually to maintain proficiency.the recipient must identify and designate sufficient staff (minimum of 1) to serve as qualified field inspection trainers to provide dietary supplement training for staff as necessary to perform dietary supplement inspections. training required for the designated person(s) must be identified and completed. recipients will conduct the in-field training necessary to ensure staff are qualified to independently conduct dietary supplement inspections and any required sampling (environmental and product). recipients can work with their assigned fda field division office for assistance with training.auditing:as part of the state contract, the state program is expected to move towards implementation of an audit program to support the dietary supplement inspection program. once implemented, the audit program should include auditing of dietary supplement inspections. as available, the recipient should collect audit data on dietary supplement inspections, inspection reports, and sample collections and reports to evaluate general inspector and program data to identify any gaps and corrective actions needed.compliance implementation strategies:recipients will establish inspection and compliance programs which incorporates the requirements of 21 cfr part 111. programs will analyze their existing regulatory authority and identify strategies to address any gaps in existing laws and regulations. programs will analyze their existing enforcement capabilities for dietary supplements and identify gaps in existing procedures. recipients will work towards development of enforcement strategies appropriate for a dietary supplement inspection program including identifying critical observations, methods for monitoring chronic violators and chronic violations in conformance with standard 6 of the mfrps.program improvement and infrastructure development:recipients will identify and provide the framework to address the gaps in agency infrastructure necessary to fully adopt and implement the cgmps for dietary supplements rule as a part of the manufactured food regulatory program. infrastructure needs may include personnel, it, regulatory foundation, training, updating procedures and records, management programs, and laboratory. recipients should consider information sharing capabilities with fda in this assessment, as appropriate. recipients should also propose how project developed capabilities will be maintained after the conclusion of the project.other outreach activities:develop an outreach plan (as required in standard 7) and associated materials related to dietary supplement regulation and compliance as part of the state program's overall outreach plan. recipients should consider outreach to industry, including presentations at conferences, food protection task force meetings, website updates and/or other outreach efforts as appropriate.joint work planning and enforcement:fda and state personnel will meet as necessary to develop and monitor progress in work planning for dietary supplement facilities under inspection by both agencies to ensure mutually beneficial results. when discussing work planning, best practices, such as those published by the partnership for food protection (pfp), may be used as a resource to guide these meetings. the recipient should evaluate current enforcement tools, strategies, and trends to determine their effectiveness and share findings with fda. recipients are also encouraged to assist with updating guidance documents and participate in pilot projects to advance joint work planning, information sharing, firm reconciliation and enforcement actions between the state and fda, as necessary.projects that support innovation and integration in a nationally integrated food safety system (ifss) using the mfrps framework. state programs will be expected to complete the special project within the proposed project period. all project deliverables and resources developed must be made available to other programs.examples of criteria to consider when developing special project proposals include:(a) exceeds criteria in mfrps program elements.(b) addresses an ifss issue or problem.(c) is based on the most current public and environmental health and regulatory science and data available.(d) introduces an innovative approach (a new method, idea, protocol, tool/resource).(e) produces outcome data and/or a product and lessons learned that can be shared with fda and other stakeholders.(f) reflects and promotes inter-agency communication, collaboration, coordination, accountability, transparency and sharing of information.(g) supports fda’s mission and vision for building mutual reliance in an ifss under fsma.(h) focuses on prevention, intervention or response activities.(i) supports national or external (outside of applicant's state) capacity/capability development for prevention, intervention or response.potential special projects include but are not limited to:development of a new inspections or investigations course, such as for a specific commodity, investigation technique, industry, or new rule.development of a new environmental sampling methodology to enhance efficiency.development of a system to collaborate with fda and other agencies through it information sharing.development of an electronic risk-based modeling program that can demonstrate increased efficiency and effectiveness.development of a new foodborne
