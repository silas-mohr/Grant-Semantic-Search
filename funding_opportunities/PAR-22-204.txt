programs (orip) encourages grant applications aimed at developing, characterizing, or improving animal models for hiv/aids research or for improving access to information about or generated from the use of these specialized animal models for such research. the animal models, related biological materials, or technological tools to be developed must be broadly applicable to the scientific interests of two or more nih institutes or centers (ics) and must explore multiple organ systems or evaluate diseases and processes that impact multiple organ systems in order to align with orip’s nih-wide mission and programs as well as the nih hiv/aids research priorities developed by the office of aids research. applications must describe the need for and the potential impact of the proposed resources on hiv/aids research. applications for developing a limited number of resources or resources that will not have a broad impact on hiv/aids research will not be considered acceptable for this funding opportunity announcement.not applicableall applications are due by 5:00 pm local time of applicant organization.applicants are encouraged to apply early to allow adequate time to make any corrections to errors found in the application during the submission process by the due date.not applicableit is critical that applicants follow the instructions in the research (r) instructions in the sf424 (r&r) application guide, except where instructed to do otherwise (in this foa or in a notice from nih guide for grants and contracts).conformance to all requirements (both in the application guide and the foa) is required and strictly enforced. applicants must read and follow all application instructions in the application guide as well as any program-specific instructions noted in section iv. when the program-specific instructions deviate from those in the application guide, follow the program-specific instructions.applications that do not comply with these instructions may be delayed or not accepted for review.there are several options available to submit your application through grants.gov to nih and department of health and human services partners. you must use one of these submission options to access the application forms for this opportunity.animal models are indispensable for studying the genetic basis and pathobiological mechanisms of diseases, identifying drug targets, and developing effective preventive and therapeutic approaches in hiv/aids research. as described in the nih strategic plan for hiv and hiv-related research, the office of aids research (oar) has established the following hiv/aids research priorities for the nih based on current data about the hiv pandemic and the science to prevent, treat, and ultimately cure hiv/aids:animal models have made, and will continue to make, critical contributions to these research priorities. efficient use of animal models is facilitated by readily available research resources that are optimized for use with those models. animal-related resources include mutant and transgenic animals; related biological materials, such as nucleic acids, proteins, cell cultures, and tissues; reagents; and knowledge of an animal’s genome, life cycle, molecular, cellular, and physiological phenotypes, and behaviors. animal-related resources can also include information needed for optimal use of animal models, such as physical and genetic maps or computer models. orip supports development, maintenance, and distribution of these various types of resources related to animal models of human disease.purpose and scopewith this funding opportunity announcement (foa), orip encourages resource-related research projects that are aimed at developing and characterizing new animal-based resources, improving existing resources, or acquiring deep understanding of a model system to improve the utilization, accessibility, and translational values of animal models to the hiv/aids research community. the nih-wide mission of orip is to support all nih ics that fund basic and translational research by strengthening their existing programs, developing research resources, advancing areas of emerging science, and developing new initiatives to move biomedical research forward. therefore, proposed studies, models, technologies, and biological materials must have a broad impact on the hiv/aids research community.an application under this foa may be predominantly research based if that research potentially leads to the development of tools or resources that will have a broad impact on the hiv/aids research community. an application also may be aimed at final development or enhancement of existing resources.applications responding to this foa should:applications for developing a limited number of resources or resources that will not have a broad impact on hiv/aids research will not be considered acceptable for this foa.examples of resource-related projects suitable for this foa include, but are not limited to:examples of projects that will not be supported under this foa include those that:this foa will support the development of animal models and related biological materials to advance the research priorities established by the nih oar and have a broad impact on the hiv/aids research community. applications for developing a limited number of resources are not suitable for this foa and may be appropriate for research project grant activities through r21 or r01 awards supported by orip or other nih ics. those applications proposing to develop resources should describe plans to deposit resources to stock centers or databases accessible to the research community and register catalogs of their resources with current resource tagging and identification initiatives, such as force 11. these projects should also encourage investigators who use the resources to make use of the research resource identifiers (rrids) in their publications and reports.program directors/principal investigators (pd/pis) planning to work with their institutions to submit applications to this foa are strongly encouraged to contact the scientific contacts prior to submission (see scientific/research contacts in section vii. agency contacts) to be advised on appropriateness of the intended resource and research plans for this program, competitiveness of a potential application, and alignment with the nih orip and oar program priorities.see section viii. other information for award authorities and regulations.grant: a support mechanism providing money, property, or both to an eligible entity to carry out an approved project or activity.new or resubmission grants funded under the auspices of this foa will be eligible for only one funded renewal (i.e., a new grant has the potential for two four-year cycles of funding). any new grant, whether originally funded under the current foa or the previous foas, including rfa-od-19-027 and par-16-369, is eligible to compete for only one more four-year cycle of funding. any renewed grant, whether originally funded under the current foa or the previous foas, including rfa-od-19-027 and par-16-369, is not eligible for any renewal.the oer glossary and the sf424 (r&r) application guide provide details on these application types. only those application types listed here are allowed for this foa.not

in the review process. applications submitted to the nih in support of the nih mission are evaluated for scientific and technical merit through the nih peer review system.reviewers will provide an overall impact score to reflect their assessment of the likelihood for the project to exert a sustained, powerful influence on the research field(s) involved, in consideration of the following review criteria and additional review criteria (as applicable for the project proposed).reviewers will consider each of the review criteria below in the determination of scientific merit and give a separate score for each. an application does not need to be strong in all categories to be judged likely to have major scientific impact. for example, a project that by its nature is not innovative may be essential to advance a field.does the project address an important problem or a critical barrier to progress in the field? is the prior research that serves as the key support for the proposed project rigorous? if the aims of the project are achieved, how will scientific knowledge, technical capability, and/or clinical practice be improved? how will successful completion of the aims change the concepts, methods, technologies, treatments, services, or preventative interventions that drive this field?do the proposed resources or resource-related research projects support the research priorities established by the nih oar?do the proposed resources or resource-related research meet the needs of broad research areas supported by two or more nih ics?are the pd(s)/pi(s), collaborators, and other researchers well suited to the project? if early stage investigators or those in the early stages of independent careers, do they have appropriate experience and training? if established, have they demonstrated an ongoing record of accomplishments that have advanced their field(s)? if the project is collaborative or multi-pd/pi, do the investigators have complementary and integrated expertise; are their leadership approach, governance and organizational structure appropriate for the project?does the application challenge and seek to shift current research or clinical practice paradigms by utilizing novel theoretical concepts, approaches or methodologies, instrumentation, or interventions? are the concepts, approaches or methodologies, instrumentation, or interventions novel to one field of research or novel in a broad sense? is a refinement, improvement, or new application of theoretical concepts, approaches or methodologies, instrumentation, or interventions proposed?are the overall strategy, methodology, and analyses well-reasoned and appropriate to accomplish the specific aims of the project? have the investigators included plans to address weaknesses in the rigor of prior research that serves as the key support for the proposed project? have the investigators presented strategies to ensure a robust and unbiased approach, as appropriate for the work proposed? are potential problems, alternative strategies, and benchmarks for success presented? if the project is in the early stages of development, will the strategy establish feasibility and will particularly risky aspects be managed? have the investigators presented adequate plans to address relevant biological variables, such as sex, for studies in vertebrate animals or human subjects?is the approach to developing animal models or related resources feasible? does the application describe a plan to track the impact of the proposed resources or resource-related research on research priorities established by the nih oar? is the proposed plan reasonable and feasible? does the application describe a clear plan for dissemination of information and possible future distribution of the proposed resources or resource-related research to the scientific community after the project is completed?if the project involves human subjects and/or nih-defined clinical research, are the plans to address 1) the protection of human subjects from research risks, and 2) inclusion (or exclusion) of individuals on the basis of sex/gender, race, and ethnicity, as well as the inclusion or exclusion of individuals of all ages (including children and older adults), justified in terms of the scientific goals and research strategy proposed?will the institutional environment in which the [center] will operate contribute to the probability of success in facilitating the research [program/projects/network/consortium] it serves? are the institutional support, equipment and other physical resources available to the investigators adequate for the [center] proposed? will the [center] benefit from unique features of the institutional environment, infrastructure, or personnel? are resources available within the scientific environment to support electronic information handling?will the scientific environment in which the work will be done contribute to the probability of success? are the institutional support, equipment and other physical resources available to the investigators adequate for the project proposed? will the project benefit from unique features of the scientific environment, subject populations, or collaborative arrangements?as applicable for the project proposed, reviewers will evaluate the following additional items while determining scientific and technical merit, and in providing an overall impact score, but will not give separate scores for these items.for research that involves human subjects but does not involve one of the categories of research that are exempt under 45 cfr part 46, the committee will evaluate the justification for involvement of human subjects and the proposed protections from research risk relating to their participation according to the following five review criteria: 1) risk to subjects, 2) adequacy of protection against risks, 3) potential benefits to the subjects and others, 4) importance of the knowledge to be gained, and 5) data and safety monitoring for clinical trials.for research that involves human subjects and meets the criteria for one or more of the categories of research that are exempt under 45 cfr part 46, the committee will evaluate: 1) the justification for the exemption, 2) human subjects involvement and characteristics, and 3) sources of materials. for additional information on review of the human subjects section, please refer to the guidelines for the review of human subjects.when the proposed project involves human subjects and/or nih-defined clinical research, the committee will evaluate the proposed plans for the inclusion (or exclusion) of individuals on the basis of sex/gender, race, and ethnicity, as well as the inclusion (or exclusion) of individuals of all ages (including children and older adults) to determine if it is justified in terms of the scientific goals and research strategy proposed. for additional information on review of the inclusion section, please refer to the guidelines for the review of inclusion in clinical research.the committee will evaluate the involvement of live vertebrate animals as part of the scientific assessment according to the following criteria: (1) description of proposed procedures involving animals, including species, strains, ages, sex, and total number to be used; (2) justifications for the use of animals versus alternative models and for the appropriateness of the species proposed; (3) interventions to minimize discomfort, distress, pain and injury; and (4) justification for euthanasia method if not consistent with the avma guidelines for the euthanasia of animals. reviewers will assess the use of chimpanzees as they would any other application proposing the use of vertebrate animals. for additional information on review of the vertebrate animals section, please refer to the worksheet for review of the vertebrate animals section.reviewers will assess whether materials or procedures proposed are potentially hazardous to research personnel and/or the environment, and if needed, determine whether adequate protection is proposed.for resubmissions, the committee will evaluate the application as now presented, taking into consideration the responses to comments from the previous scientific review group and changes made to the project.for renewals, the committee will consider the progress made in the last funding period.for revisions, the committee will consider the appropriateness of the proposed expansion of the scope of the project. if the revision application relates to a specific line of investigation presented in the original application that was not recommended for approval by the committee, then the committee will consider whether the responses to comments from the previous scientific review group are adequate and whether substantial changes are clearly evident.note: effective for due dates on or after january 25, 2023, the data sharing plan and genomic data sharing plan (gds) as part of the resource sharing plan will not be evaluated at time of review.as applicable for the project proposed, reviewers will consider each of the following items, but will not give scores for these items, and should not consider them in providing an overall impact score.not applicablereviewers will assess the information provided in this section of the application, including 1) the select agent(s) to be used in the proposed research, 2) the registration status of all entities where select agent(s) will be used, 3) the procedures that will be used to monitor possession use and transfer of select agent(s), and 4) plans for appropriate biosafety, biocontainment, and security of the select agent(s).reviewers will comment on whether the following resource sharing plans, or the rationale for not sharing the following types of resources, are reasonable: (1) data sharing plan; (2) sharing model organisms; and (3) genomic data sharing plan (gds).for involving key biological and/or chemical resources, reviewers will comment on the brief plans proposed for identifying and ensuring the validity of those resources.reviewers will consider whether the budget and the requested period of support are fully justified and reasonable in relation to the proposed research.2. review and selection processapplications will be evaluated for scientific and technical merit by (an) appropriate scientific review group(s) convened by center for scientific review, in accordance with nih peer review policy and procedures, using the stated review criteria. assignment to a scientific review group will be shown in the era commons.as part of the scientific peer review, all applications will receive a written
