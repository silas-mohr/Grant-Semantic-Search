behavioral and social sciences research (obssr)office of dietary supplements (ods)office of research on women's health (orwh)the eunice kennedy shriver national institute of child health and human development and participating nih institutes and offices announce this new funding opportunity to advance the goals of the nih implementing a maternal health and pregnancy outcomes vision for everyone (improve) initiative. improve aims to understand the biological, behavioral, environmental, sociocultural, and structural factors that affect pregnancy-related and pregnancy-associated morbidity and mortality and build an evidence base for improved care and outcomes. the initiative promotes research to address health disparities associated with pregnancy-related and pregnancy-associated morbidity and mortality.the purpose of this notice of special interest (nosi) is to stimulate dissemination and implementation research on innovative approaches built on evidence-based findings from foundational research on factors that contribute to maternal morbidity and mortality (mmm). this nosi will support the development and implementation of strategies to inform integrated efforts involving policy and practice changes to improve preconception, pregnancy, perinatal, and postpartum care and advance maternal health and maternal health equity.definitionsfor the purpose of this nosi, note the following definitions:“structural discrimination” refers to macro-level conditions (e.g., residential segregation) that limit opportunities, resources, and well-being of less privileged groups (healthy people 2020, https://www.healthypeople.gov/2020/topics-objectives/topic/social-determinants-health/interventions-resources/discrimination).“structural racism and discrimination (srd)” refers to structural discrimination on the basis of race/ethnicity and/or other statuses, including but not limited to gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, disability status, social class or socioeconomic status, religion, national origin, immigration status, limited english proficiency, or physical characteristics or health conditions.“nih-designated u.s. populations that experience health disparities” nih-designated health disparity populations (hdps) currently include blacks/african americans, hispanics/latinos, american indians/alaska natives, asian americans, native hawaiians and other pacific islanders, socioeconomically disadvantaged populations, underserved rural populations, and sexual and gender minorities (see https://www.nimhd.nih.gov/about/overview/).“health care models” refers to the different existing or newly proposed models of patient-centered care. examples of existing health care models include the chronic care model, the ehealth enhanced chronic care model, the community-based transition model, the nurse management model, the home-based model, the integrated delivery systems model, the patient-centered model and the value-based care models.“multi-component” refers to the different components of the health care models (e.g., health care system organization, clinician decision support, clinical information system, patient self-management support, delivery system design, and others).“multi-level” refers to the multi-dimensional framework of determinants relevant to understand minority health and address health disparities. this concept is further described under the nimhd research framework (https://www.nimhd.nih.gov/about/overview/research-framework/).“dissemination research” is defined as the scientific study of targeted distribution of information and intervention materials to a specific public health or clinical practice audience. the intent is to understand how best to communicate and integrate knowledge and the associated evidence-based interventions. gaps include missing critical information about how, when, by whom, and under what circumstances evidence spreads throughout communities, organizations, front line workers, and consumers of public health and clinical services.“implementation research” is defined as the scientific study of the use of strategies to adopt and integrate evidence-based health interventions into clinical and community settings to improve individual outcomes and benefit population health. implementation research seeks to understand the behavior of practitioners and support staff, organizations, consumers and family members, and policymakers in context as key influences on the adoption, implementation, and sustainability of evidence-based health interventions and guidelines (e.g., community guide to preventive services, u.s. preventive services task force, and clinical and professional societies' recommendations and guidelines).“dissemination and implementation (d&i) research” broadly, studies in this field typically involve both interdisciplinary cooperation and trans-disciplinary collaboration, utilizing theories, empirical findings, and methods from a variety of fields. relevant fields include but are not limited to the following: information science, clinical decision-making, organizational and management theory, economics, individual and systems-level behavioral change, public health, business and public administration, statistics, anthropology, epidemiology, learning theory, engineering, and marketing. d&i research will often include significant and ongoing collaboration with stakeholders from multiple public health and/or clinical practice settings as well as consumers of services and their families/social networks.“maternity care desert” maternity care deserts are counties in which access to maternity health care services is limited or absent, either through lack of services or barriers to a woman's ability to access that care within counties. a maternity care desert is any county in the united states without a hospital or birth center offering obstetric care and without any obstetric providers. low access to appropriate preventive, prenatal and postpartum care is defined as counties with one or fewer hospitals or birth centers that provide obstetric care, few obstetric providers (fewer than 60 per 10,000 births) or a high proportion of women without health insurance (10 percent or more). moderate access to care is defined as living in a county with access to few hospitals/birth centers or obstetrical providers and adequate health insurance coverage (less than 10 percent of women of reproductive age uninsured). full access to maternity care can be defined by availability of hospitals or birth centers providing obstetric care and availability of providers offering obstetric care.“community organization” a non-federal, non-academic organization that provides goods, services, support, resources, or advocacy to members of a defined community. examples include community or faith-based organizations, local businesses, neighborhood associations, labor unions, patient or consumer advocacy groups, public health departments, healthcare systems, school systems, law enforcement or criminal justice agencies, social service agencies, or departments of commerce, labor, transportation, housing, recreation. governmental organizations at the local, regional, tribal, or state level fall within this definition. for additional resources on dissemination and implementation

https://www.nih.gov/research-training/medical-research-initiatives/improve-initiative.backgroundmaternal morbidity and mortality (mmm) in the united states is the highest among developed nations. approximately 700 women each year die of causes related to pregnancy in the united states. mortality rates for black women (40.8 mortality incidences per 100,000 births) were more than 320% higher than white women (12.7), and native american women (29.7) demonstrated rates nearly 240% higher. it is estimated that about one-third of pregnancy-related deaths occur during pregnancy, one-third occur during or in the week after delivery, and one third occur between 1 week to 1 year postpartum.in addition, approximately 50,000 women experience severe maternal morbidity (smm). causes of maternal morbidity and smm are multifaceted and vary widely by state. in the united states, the leading causes are cardiovascular disease, hypertension, thromboembolism, hemorrhage, infection, and mental health related conditions, including substance use, suicide, and violence. significant contributing factors include comorbid conditions (e.g., obesity, mental health, and substance use disorders) and structural and health care system factors. it is estimated that 60–70 percent of maternal deaths in the united states are preventable.high rates of pregnancy-related and pregnancy-associated morbidity and mortality disproportionately affect specific racial/ethnic populations. black or african american (aa) and american indian/alaska native (ai/an) women are 2 to 4 times more likely to die from pregnancy-related causes compared to white women. furthermore, black or african american, hispanic/latina, asian, pacific islander, and american indian/alaska native women all have higher incidence of smm compared to white women.several factors affect mmm, including, age, disabilities, geographical location, and social determinants of health (sdoh), including, but not limited to, education, structural discrimination and racism, and socioeconomic standing. sdoh and psychosocial factors (e.g., stress, social isolation, mental health, intimate partner violence, substance use, quality of life, etc.) contribute to pregnancy-related and pregnancy-associated morbidity and mortality, particularly among women from racial/ethnic minority groups, less privileged socioeconomic status groups, and other underserved populations. structural discrimination and racism (e.g., residential segregation that restricts access to healthcare and healthy living environments) have profound negative impacts on maternal health and well-being outcomes during pregnancy and up to one year postpartum. structural factors that contribute to negative impacts include occupational segregation and barriers which limit access to health insurance, sick or maternity leave, and healthy working conditions (inclusive of contributing policies and organizational psychology that impact these barriers); and criminal justice inequities that lead to a greater risk of incarceration or fewer legal protections for women who are victims of violence, amongst others. therefore, implementing multifaceted strategies to address preventable contributors to mmm in under-represented populations that experience health disparities (hdps), and conducting novel systems research examining the health care and community approaches to maternal wellbeing have the potential to drastically reduce pregnancy-related maternal deaths and decrease maternal morbidity.to address morbidity and mortality related to and associated with pregnancy, the nih launched the implementing a maternal health and pregnancy outcomes vision for everyone (improve) initiative. improve supports research to reduce preventable causes of maternal deaths and improve health for pregnant and postpartum women before, during, and after delivery. the initiative focuses on addressing the leading causes of mmm. improve places particular emphasis on understanding the contributing factors and eliminating the adverse maternal outcomes related to sdoh disproportionally affecting populations that experience health disparities.improve seeks to cover the full spectrum of research related to mmm, from foundational and mechanistic science, and interventional approaches through to implementation and dissemination. while there are a variety of evidence-based practices, interventions, and clinical guidelines available to address many factors contributing to mmm, best practices are not available and/or have not been equitably implemented or delivered. some approaches may not yet be sufficient to address root causes for populations experiencing health disparities.specific objectiveswith this nosi, nih invites research grant applications to plan and carry out projects to disseminate and implement evidence-based interventions or practices into public health, clinical, and community (e.g., workplace, school, place of worship) settings to advance a holistic approach to improve maternal health and maternal health equity in populations disproportionately impacted by mmm. applicants are encouraged to propose studies that include interventions with demonstrated efficacy for the target populations and demonstrated effectiveness in real-world settings. strategies should include plans to identify and overcome barriers and facilitators and adapt to local contexts.evidence-based practice areas of interest include behavioral interventions; prevention, early detection, diagnostic, treatment, and management interventions; and quality improvement programs, with emphasis on culturally and linguistically appropriate strategies for nih-designated hdps. of particular interest are evidence-based practices with demonstrated effectiveness that address mmm related to sdoh, stress-, cardiovascular-, metabolic-, infectious-, mental health-, and infection and immunity-related causes.multidisciplinary, systems, and community-partnered implementation science approaches utilizing existing community-engaged partnerships to reduce morbidity and mortality related to and associated with pregnancy encompassing the preconception, pregnancy and post-partum periods are encouraged.applicants may propose approaches for the identification, development, testing, deployment, evaluation, and/or refinement of implementation and dissemination strategies. projects may include pilot/feasibility studies or full-scale implementation or dissemination projects.this notice encourages multidisciplinary investigators with expertise in developing and testing strategies to address preventable contributors to smm and mm in under-represented minority populations and proficiency in conducting novel systems research investigating health care and community-partnered approaches to maternal well-being to consider working with their relevant institutions to apply for this nosi. projects must include a focus on one or more u.s. populations that experience maternal health disparities, such as underrepresented racial and ethnic communities (including but not limited to blacks/african americans, hispanics/latinos, american indians/alaska natives, asian americans, native hawaiians and other pacific islanders), socioeconomically disadvantaged groups, underserved rural populations (e.g., living in obstetrical deserts), sexual and gender minority groups, or persons with disabilities. in addition to scientific diversity, applicants must incorporate diversity in their team development plan. please refer to notice of nih’s interest in diversity, not-od-20-031, for more details.for clinical trial proposals, dissemination and implementation research should be limited to strategies to disseminate and/or implement interventions that have evidence of efficacy/potency, as well as evidence that the intervention can be delivered in the community with fidelity.implementation of evidence-based interventionsareas of interest include but are not limited to:build evidence to address gaps in maternal health implementation scienceareas of interest include but are not limited to:key considerationscollaborative research. given the range of expertise that may be needed for conducting dissemination and implementation research, applicants are encouraged to leverage multidisciplinary teams of scientists and stakeholders.community engagement. investigators proposing implementation projects should engage community partners at the onset and throughout the project who can successfully advise and provide feedback to implementation strategy development and testing teams. this type of involvement may include advice from the community, partnership in research, and shared leadership.all projects are encouraged to leverage existing resources and expand community partnerships (e.g., tribal governments and agencies, academic, private, safety-net health systems, other health systems, grassroots organizations, public health departments, community and faith-based organizations, and schools or childcare settings) to complete the study aims. approaches such as team science, community-engaged research, participatory action research, and related approaches may be used to engage stakeholders and underserved populations throughout the research process. study budgets should include funds for the community partners to be fully engaged and successfully participate in research design and implementation.key characteristics of implementation (d&i) research:all applications must address how the proposed research impacts maternal health in u.s. hdps and how it may contribute to achieving maternal health equity. studies that examine or address multiple levels and domains of influence affecting maternal health, care, and access are strongly encouraged (see the nimhd research framework for more information). projects are expected to incorporate research strategies to address individual and structural sdoh that present barriers to adequate and timely health care.expected interactions, collaboration and sharingawardees will be expected to pursue opportunities for interaction, sharing and collaboration with the maternal health research centers of excellence (coes) to be launched by nih in 2023 (see rfa-hd-23-035, rfa-hd-23-036, and rfa-hd-23-037). the goal of the centers of excellence will be to conduct collaborative research to mitigate preventable maternal mortality, decrease maternal morbidity and promote maternal health equity and enhance research to advance maternal health. the data innovation and coordinating hub/resource center and the implementation science hub/resource center will serve as a research resource where data collected from the improve centers of excellence and other improve projects including those to be supported through this nosi, can be aggregated, accessed, analyzed, and shared within and across maternal health research centers of excellence. investigators are encouraged to review the improve funding announcements when designing their application. upon establishment of the coes, nih will provide opportunities for nosi awardees and coe leadership and the hubs to leverage resources, establish the approaches for data and methodology sharing and discuss opportunities for scientific collaboration. specifically, nih will provide investigators conducting projects awarded through this nosi opportunities to interact with the maternal health research centers of excellence data implementation science hub/resource center (see rfa-hd-23-037). the implementation science hub will develop and implement a consultation and technical assistance program tailored to the needs of the maternal health research centers and other improve projects and facilitate in bridging the evidence-to-practice gap to inform integrated efforts involving policy and practice changes to improve pregnancy, perinatal, and postpartum care and advance maternal health and maternal health equity.data harmonizationto maximize comparisons across datasets or studies and facilitate data integration and collaboration where appropriate to study aims, researchers funded through this nosi are strongly encouraged to use the following data resources below. in particular, the use of the collections
