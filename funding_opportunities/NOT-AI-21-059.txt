july 30, 2021pa-20-185 - nih research project grant (parent r01 clinical trial not allowed) pa-20-195 - nih exploratory/developmental research project grant (parent r21 clinical trial not allowed)national institute of allergy and infectious diseases (niaid)this notice of special interest (nosi) solicits transdisciplinary research projects to understand the immunologic events in the vertebrate host that occur at the bite site (skin) and systemically during and after feeding by hematophagous and ectoparasitic arthropods. exploratory research on arthropod blood feeding was formerly supported by niaid through the expired foa, par-18-860, “immune response to arthropod blood feeding (r21 clinical trial not allowed). the intent of this nosi is to indicate continued niaid support for research in this area as described below through applications to the parent r01 and r21 foas.backgroundthe national institute of allergy and infectious diseases (niaid), national institutes of health (nih), promotes and supports a broad range of research programs focused on advancing the understanding of immunology, vector biology, and transmission of vector-borne pathogens.a large number of pathogens are transmitted to humans by arthropod vectors, but how these pathogens are transmitted from arthropod vectors to vertebrate hosts is not well-defined. a common feature shared among hematophagous arthropod vectors during blood feeding is the exchange of biologically active molecules and microbiota between the arthropod and the vertebrate host at the bite site. during this process, the arthropod releases salivary factors into the vertebrate host skin and ingests vertebrate bioactive molecules.it is well-established that arthropod salivary factors have immunomodulatory effects in the vertebrate host and play a significant role in pathogen transmission and pathogenesis. similarly, although ectoparasites (e.g., mites, chiggers, bed bugs) may not transmit pathogens, they can live and multiply in human skin, and feed within the skin interface, thereby exposing the vertebrate host to salivary immunomodulatory factors, which not only lead to localized inflammation, allergy, dermatitis, or vein eruptions, but also indirectly increase the transmission of various viruses and bacteria. however, few of these salivary immunomodulatory and immunosuppressive molecules have been characterized in select arthropod vectors. many of the individual salivary components have not yet been identified and the mechanisms by which they act on the vertebrate host are largely unknown. research on the identification of immunoregulatory salivary factors and elucidation of the underlying mechanism of how the salivary components modulate the immune system will significantly expand our understanding of the pathogenesis of vector-borne diseases and shed light on the development of novel vaccines and therapeutics to prevent and treat these diseases. in addition, the recent increase in allergic responses to red meat and other animal-derived products following tick bites has highlighted the importance of the interplay between arthropod-derived salivary factors and the vertebrate host’s immune system. thus, this nosi supports studies to better understand the role of arthropod salivary factors in the establishment of vector-borne infections and immune-mediated diseases (e.g., alpha-gal syndrome), and local as well as systemic immune modulation. this nosi supports the nih strategic plan for tickborne disease research (objective 1.3.: alpha-gal syndrome, 1.4.: study of salivary proteins).in addition to addressing the immediate scientific objectives, studies in response to this nosi will have broader implication. identification and characterization of novel immunologically active molecules from blood-feeding arthropods could lead to the identification of new vaccine adjuvants, therapeutic drugs for the treatment of inflammation or autoimmune disease, or new antigenic targets for the development of vaccines against arthropod saliva or as biomarkers of exposure to vector bite.research objectivesthe purpose of this nosi is to encourage transdisciplinary research to understand the immunologic events in the vertebrate host that occur during and after feeding by hematophagous (e.g., mosquitoes, ticks) and ectoparasitic (e.g., mites, chiggers, bed bugs) arthropods at the bite site and systemically.given current knowledge gaps, some research areas may involve or require descriptive projects. another goal of this nosi is to foster new and/or strengthen existing collaborations between vector biologists and immunologists.the scientific objectives of this nosi initiative are to:examples of research topics supported by this
