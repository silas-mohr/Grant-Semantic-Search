notice number: not-hg-20-017key dates release date: february 6, 2020 first available due date: may 25, 2020 expiration date: may 26, 2023par-23-078 - biomedical knowledgebase (u24 - clinical trials not allowed)par-23-079 - biomedical data repository (u24 - clinical trials not allowed)issued by national human genome research institute (nhgri)purposethe purpose of this nosi is to communicate nhgri’s special interest in potential applications under the biomedical data repository (par-20-089) and knowledgebase (par-20-097) foas, focused on the establishment of new, or continued development of established genomic data resources that use state-of-the-art and cost-effective technologies and approaches, and that are of high value to the broad genomic research community. this nosi applies to applications for both data repositories and knowledgebases.topics of interestspecifically, nhgri will support the development of data resources that will accelerate genomic research on the structure of genomes, the biology of genomes, and the biology of disease; that will advance the science of genomic medicine; and that will incorporate genomics to improve the effectiveness of healthcare. note, for the purpose of this notice we use the term “resource” to encompass both data repositories and knoweldgebases. nhgri will only accept applications that support the collection, curation, integration, and distribution of data and information related to genome-wide sets of genes, variants, sequences, phenotypes, and other genetic and genomic information.applications for data resources that support genomic research that is relevant only to a particular disease or organ system will not be supported by nhgri and should be directed to another appropriate nih institute or center. applications for data resources that support specific biological questions, such as human development or mechanisms of mutation, are also not appropriate for nhgri.the data should be from humans, model organism of human diseases, or other biomedically relevant species. microbial and microbiome databases are not appropriate for nhgri support.applicants are strongly encouraged to consult the nhgri scientific/research contact regarding the appropriateness of the planned data resource application to nhgri’s mission, scientific areas of interests and programmatic priorities. nhgri-defined programmatic needs will play a large part in determining which resources are supported, as well as the long-term funding needs and sustainability plans of proposed data resources.application and submission informationsubmit applications for this initiative using one of the following foas or any reissues of these announcements through the expiration date of this notice.this notice applies to due dates on or after september 25, 2020 of the foas listed above, and subsequent receipt dates through may 9, 2023.all instructions in the sf424 (r&r) application guide and the funding opportunity announcement used for submission must be followed, with the following additions:although nhgri is not listed as a participating organization in all the foas listed above, applications for this initiative will be accepted.inquiriesscientific/research contact(s) christopher wellington national human genome research institute (nhgri) telephone: 301-480-3496 email: wellingtonc@mail.nih.govpeer review contact(s)ken nakamura, ph.d. national human genome research institute (nhgri) telephone: 301-402-8823 email: nakamurk@mail.nih.govfinancial/grants management contact(s)anneliese galczynski national human genome research institute (nhgri) telephone: 301-443-4935 email: anneliese.galczynski@nih.govweekly toc for this announcement nih funding opportunities and noticesnote: for help accessing pdf, rtf, ms word, excel, powerpoint, audio or video files, see help downloading files.
