funding opportunitysee section iii. 3. additional information on eligibility.the national institute on aging (nia) invites outstanding graduate students from a wide range of broad research areas who are interested in receiving aging-related postdoctoral training to apply to this funding opportunity announcement (foa). this foa seeks to foster the development of research and clinician scientists in the following areas: genetic, biological, clinical, epidemiological, neuroscientific, behavioral, social, and economic research on aging, both basic and translational.successful applicants will be awarded the transition to aging research award for predoctoral students, whose purpose is to recruit and retain emerging investigators in aging research. this two-phase award will allow awardees to complete doctoral dissertation projects and provide a variety of training supports to facilitate the smooth transition of doctoral graduates into competitive, aging-focused postdoctoral positions.this funding opportunity announcement (foa) does not allow applicants to propose to lead an independent clinical trial, but does allow applicants to propose research experience in a clinical trial led by a sponsor or co-sponsor.not applicableall applications are due by 5:00 pm local time of applicant organization.applicants are encouraged to apply early to allow adequate time to make any corrections to errors found in the application during the submission process by the due date.no late applications will be accepted for this funding opportunity announcement.not applicableit is critical that applicants follow the fellowship (f) instructions in the sf424 (r&r) application guide except where instructed to do otherwise (in this foa or in a notice from the nih guide for grants and contracts). conformance to all requirements (both in the application guide and the foa) is required and strictly enforced. applicants must read and follow all application instructions in the application guide as well as any program-specific instructions noted in section iv. when the program-specific instructions deviate from those in the application guide, follow the program-specific instructions. applications that do not comply with these instructions may be delayed or not accepted for review.there are several options available to submit your application through grants.gov to nih and department of health and human services partners. you must use one of these submission options to access the application forms for this opportunity.note: this funding opportunity announcement (foa) does not allow applicants to propose to lead an independent clinical trial, but does allow applicants to propose research experience in a clinical trial led by a sponsor or co-sponsor.this foa seeks to foster the development of research and clinician scientists in the following areas: genetic, biological, clinical, epidemiological, neuroscientific, behavioral, social, and economic research on aging, both basic and translational. successful applicants will be awarded the transition to aging research award for predoctoral students (f99/k00), whose purpose is to facilitate the transition of outstanding and committed graduate students into aging-focused post-doctoral positions.the f99/k00 award may provide up to six years of support in two phases. the f99 phase provides a minimum of one, and up to two, years of support to doctoral students to complete their dissertation research projects before transitioning into the aging-focused post-doctoral phase (k00). please note that the k00 phase supports the awardees for up to four years of mentored post-doctoral training; however, the fourth year of award is contingent upon submission of any career development award application (e.g., k99/r00) before the end of the third year of the k00 phase.please note that the four years of k00 support of this award will not preclude the awardees from applying for other mentored nia career development (k) awards, such as k99/r00. awardees can justify the need for additional mentored career development beyond the four years of k00 support and apply for nia's other mentored career development awards.see section viii. other information for award authorities and regulations.grant: a support mechanism providing money, property, or both to an eligible entity to carry out an

applications submitted to the nih in support of the nih mission are evaluated for scientific and technical merit through the nih peer review system.for this particular announcement, note the following:reviewers will provide an overall impact score to reflect their assessment of the likelihood that the fellowship will enhance the candidate’s potential for, and commitment to, a productive independent scientific research career in a health-related field, in consideration of the scored and additional review criteria.reviewers will consider each of the review criteria below in the determination of scientific merit, and give a separate score for each. an application does not need to be strong in all categories to be judged likely to have major scientific impact.as applicable for the project proposed, reviewers will evaluate the following additional items while determining scientific and technical merit, and in providing an overall impact score, but will not give separate scores for these items.when the proposed project involves human subjects and/or nih-defined clinical research, the committee will evaluate the proposed plans for the inclusion (or exclusion) of individuals on the basis of sex/gender, race, and ethnicity, as well as the inclusion (or exclusion) of individuals of all ages (including children and older adults) to determine if it is justified in terms of the scientific goals and research strategy proposed. for additional information on review of the inclusion section, please refer to the guidelines for the review of inclusion in clinical research.for research that involves human subjects but does not involve one of the categories of research that are exempt under 45 cfr part 46, the committee will evaluate the justification for involvement of human subjects and the proposed protections from research risk relating to their participation according to the following five review criteria: 1) risk to subjects, 2) adequacy of protection against risks, 3) potential benefits to the subjects and others, 4) importance of the knowledge to be gained, and 5) data and safety monitoring for clinical trials. for research that involves human subjects and meets the criteria for one or more of the categories of research that are exempt under 45 cfr part 46, the committee will evaluate: 1) the justification for the exemption, 2) human subjects involvement and characteristics, and 3) sources of materials. for additional information on review of the human subjects section, please refer to the guidelines for the review of human subjects.the committee will evaluate the involvement of live vertebrate animals as part of the scientific assessment according to the following criteria: (1) description of proposed procedures involving animals, including species, strains, ages, sex, and total number to be used; (2) justifications for the use of animals versus alternative models and for the appropriateness of the species proposed; (3) interventions to minimize discomfort, distress, pain and injury; and (4) justification for euthanasia method if not consistent with the avma guidelines for the euthanasia of animals. reviewers will assess the use of chimpanzees as they would any other application proposing the use of vertebrate animals. for additional information on review of the vertebrate animals section, please refer to the worksheet for review of the vertebrate animal section.for resubmissions, the committee will evaluate the application as now presented, taking into consideration the responses to comments from the previous scientific review group and changes made to the project.not allowednot allowednote: effective for due dates on or after january 25, 2023, the data sharing plan and genomic data sharing plan (gds) as part of the resource sharing plan will not be evaluated at time of review, and a data management and sharing plan is not applicable for this foa.as applicable for the project proposed, reviewers will consider each of the following items, but will not give scores for these items, and should not consider them in providing an overall impact score.all applications for support under this foa must include a plan to fulfill nih requirements for instruction in the responsible conduct of research (rcr). taking into account the level of experience of the candidate, including any prior instruction or participation in rcr as appropriate for the candidate’s career stage, the reviewers will evaluate the adequacy of the proposed rcr training in relation to the following five required components: 1) format - the required format of instruction, i.e., face-to-face lectures, coursework, and/or real-time discussion groups (a plan with only on-line instruction is not acceptable); 2) subject matter - the breadth of subject matter, e.g., conflict of interest, authorship, data management, human subjects and animal use, laboratory safety, research misconduct, research

assignment to a scientific review group will be shown in the era commons.as part of the scientific peer review, all applications will receive a written critique.applications may undergo a selection process in which only those applications deemed to have the highest scientific and technical merit (generally the top half of applications under review) will be discussed and assigned an overall impact score.appeals of initial peer review will not be accepted for applications submitted in response to this foa.applications will be assigned to the appropriate nih institute or center. applications will compete for available funds with all other recommended applications submitted in response to this foa. following initial peer review, recommended applications will receive a second level of review by the national advisory council on aging. the following will be considered in making funding decisions:3. anticipated announcement and award datesafter the peer review of the application is completed, the pd/pi will be able to access his or her summary statement (written critique) via the era commons. refer to part 1 for dates for peer review, advisory council review, and earliest start date.information regarding the disposition of applications is available in the nih grants policy statement.1. award noticesif the application is under consideration for funding, nih will request "just-in-time" information from the applicant as described in the nih grants policy statement.a formal notification in the form of a notice of award (noa) will be provided to the applicant organization for successful applications. the noa signed by the grants management officer is the authorizing document and will be sent via email to the recipient's business official.recipients must comply with any funding restrictions described in section iv.6. funding restrictions. selection of an application for award is not an authorization to begin performance. any costs incurred before receipt of the noa are at the recipient's risk. these costs may be reimbursed only to the extent considered allowable pre-award costs.any application awarded in response to this foa will be subject to terms and conditions found on the award conditions and information for nih grants website. this includes any recent legislation and policy applicable to awards that is highlighted on this website.institutional review board or independent ethics committee approval: recipient institutions must ensure that protocols are reviewed by their irb or iec. to help ensure the safety of participants enrolled in nih-funded studies, the recipient must provide nih copies of documents related to all major changes in the status of ongoing protocols.2. administrative and national policy requirementstransition to the postdoctoral career development k00 phasethe f99/k00 award is intended to facilitate the successful transition to an aging-focused postdoctoral career. consequently, a requirement for the k00 phase award is successful completion of the doctoral research degree and subsequent transition to an aging-related, mentored, traditional postdoctoral research position. applicants are encouraged to expand their skill set and apply for postdoctoral positions at departments and institutions other than where they conducted their doctoral research. it is important for all applicants to provide a detailed plan by which they will separate their work from their ph.d. sponsor. those applicants who intend to stay at the predoctoral phase institution for the postdoctoral phase should also provide a strong justification for staying. the transition from the predoctoral phase to the postdoctoral phase is intended to be continuous in time; therefore, except in unusual circumstances, nia will not extend the f99 phase. to begin the k00 award phase of the grant, individuals must a) have been offered a postdoctoral appointment to carry out aging-focused research and b) have received approval from nia for the k00 transition (see below). upon starting the k00 phase of the award, the f99 phase of the award is terminated. prospective applicants are strongly encouraged to contact their program official to discuss plans for transition to, and application for, the k00 phase as soon as a plan to assume a postdoctoral position develops, not later than 6 months prior to the end of the f99 phase of the award.a proposed k00 institution and mentor must have appropriate infrastructure to support the proposed research program and a history of external research funding. applicants may apply for nih-sponsored postdoctoral positions within the nih intramural research program (irp). however, should the individual accept such a position in the irp, the postdoctoral phase will be supported directly by nih intramural funds. the k00 postdoctoral phase institution must submit the materials on behalf of the candidate for the k00 award no later than 12 weeks prior to the proposed start of the k00 award. the institution's authorized organizational representative will email the application in pdf format using the phs 398 form to the nia scientific contact listed in section vii. the k00 application will be evaluated by nia program staff for completeness and responsiveness to the program. candidates who are not approved to transition will receive written notification from the awarding component communicating the rationale for the disapproval. this notification will typically be sent within 60 days of receipt of the k00 application. although the financial plans of nia provide support for this program, awards pursuant to this funding opportunity are contingent upon the availability of funds.instructions for the k00 transition awardk00 transition applications must follow the career development (k) instructions in the sf424 (r&r) application guide, including supplemental grant application instructions, except where instructed in the foa to do otherwise, as described here. the k00 transition application will include the following components:updated sections of the phs career development award supplemental
