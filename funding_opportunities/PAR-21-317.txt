national institutes of health (nih)national institute of dental and craniofacial research (nidcr)ug3/uh3 exploratory/developmental phased award cooperative agreementsee notices of special interest associated with this funding opportunitypar-22-068- continuation or revision of nidcr clinical trial implementation cooperative agreement (uh3 clinical trial required)see section iii. 3. additional information on eligibility.the purpose of this funding opportunity announcement (foa) is to encourage ug3/uh3 phased cooperative agreement research applications to plan and implement behavioral and social intervention clinical trials. studies appropriate for this announcement include clinical trials to develop and test behavior change interventions related to dental, oral, or craniofacial conditions. awards made under this foa will initially support a milestone-driven planning phase (ug3) for up to 2 years, with possible transition to a clinical trial implementation phase (uh3) of up to five years. only ug3 projects that have met the scientific milestones and feasibility requirements may transition to the uh3 phase. the ug3/uh3 application must be submitted as a single application, following the instructions described in this foa. the ug3 phase will permit both scientific and operational planning activities. scientific planning activities include small-scale data collection to assess the feasibility and/or acceptability of a planned behavioral or social intervention and associated study procedures (e.g., acceptability of study content or mode of delivery; feasibility of proposed data collection procedures; preliminary testing of intervention training and fidelity monitoring procedures). operational planning activities include, at a minimum, development of: the final clinical protocol; the intervention manual or equivalent; the data management system and other tools for data and quality management, safety and operational oversight plans; recruitment and retention strategies; and other essential documents. the uh3 phase will support the conduct of investigator-initiated intervention research at all stages, from early mechanistic research and intervention development (e.g., stages 0/ i) through implementation and cost-effectiveness research (stages iv/v).30 days prior to the application dateall applications are due by 5:00 pm local time of applicant organization. all types of non-aids applications allowed for this funding opportunity announcement are due on the listed date(s).applicants are encouraged to apply early to allow adequate time to make any corrections to errors found in the application during the submission process by the due date.not applicableit is critical that applicants follow the instructions in the research (r) instructions in the sf424 (r&r) application guide, except where instructed to do otherwise (in this foa or in a notice from nih guide for grants and contracts).conformance to all requirements (both in the application guide and the foa) is required and strictly enforced. applicants must read and follow all application instructions in the application guide as well as any program-specific instructions noted in section iv. when the program-specific instructions deviate from those in the application guide, follow the program-specific instructions.applications that do not comply with these instructions may be delayed or not accepted for review.there are several options available to submit your application through grants.gov to nih and department of health and human services partners. you must use one of these submission options to access the application forms for this opportunity.purposethe purpose of this foa is to provide support for planning and implementing well-designed, rigorously conducted behavioral or social intervention studies relevant to dental, oral, and craniofacial health. this foa will support a broad range of intervention research projects, for participants of any age or developmental stage; for any dental, oral, or craniofacial condition with public health significance (e.g., dental caries, periodontal disease, craniofacial anomalies, oral cancers, salivary gland dysfunctions, oral mucosal diseases, orofacial pain); for a range of outcomes (e.g., direct intervention with patients to improve outcomes, intervention with practitioners to improve care, intervention on health systems to improve continuity of care); for stakeholders from different sectors (e.g., patients, families, social networks and communities, practitioners, care-delivery systems, professional organizations, policy-makers); and for behavioral or social intervention research at all stages, from early mechanistic research and intervention development (e.g., stages 0/i) through implementation and health services research (stages iv/v).this foa may also support basic behavioral experimental studies with humans that are considered clinical trials based on the nih's revised clinical trial definition (please see clinical trial requirements for grants and contracts for guidance). such studies are sometimes referred to as basic experimental studies involving humans (besh), stage 0 studies, type 1 translation studies, or basic mechanistic studies. these studies now meet the nih definition of a clinical trial, and so are appropriate for this foa. examples of such studies include experimental manipulation or laboratory-based studies in which behavioral or social probes are used to evoke participants' responses (e.g., emotional regulation, dental fear, social norms, pain intensity) under varied conditions, and for which proximal health-related behavioral or social outcomes—but not necessarily disease outcomes--are assessed.this foa does not support the testing of drugs, devices or biologics regulated by the fda. applicants interested in conducting such trials are encouraged to contact an nidcr program official and to visit the nidcr clinical trials program website.backgroundthe nidcr behavioral and social sciences research program supports research consistent with two trans-nih frameworks for approaching behavior change: the nih stage model of intervention development, and the nih common fund's science of behavior change experimental medicine approach. both frameworks emphasize the importance of understanding mechanisms of behavior change, as the building blocks of a cumulative science of behavior change, and as the essential elements of developing interventions and programs that can be adapted for sustainable delivery in their target settings.the nih stage model of intervention developmentthe stage model provides a framework for describing where an intervention is in the developmental pipeline, and specifies research activities appropriate for different stages of intervention development. for instance, the stage model describes different research activities that are typical in early intervention-development studies than are typical in effectiveness or implementation studies. the stage model also describes activities expected in all stages of intervention development, including the specification of hypothesized mechanisms of action of the intervention, and the inclusion of fidelity monitoring activities, although use of fidelity data may change with the stage of intervention development. the nih stage model provides a common language that facilitates discussion of intervention development research by applicants, reviewers, and funders. applications for nidcr support of clinical trials research are expected to identify research proposals using the nih stage model framework, described in detail here.the nih common fund's science of behavior change programthe nidcr behavioral and social sciences clinical research and clinical trials program also draws on the mechanisms-focused, experimental medicine approach encouraged by the nih common fund's science of behavior change (sobc) program. the experimental medicine approach to behavior change research encourages clear a priori specification of the intended behavioral and social target(s) of an intervention, and methods that test the degree to which an experimental manipulation or intervention engaged those targets. the sobc program describes 4 steps involved in the experimental medicine approach: 1) identifying one or more hypothesized intervention targets; 2) attempting to engage the target(s) through experimentation or intervention; 3) measuring the degree to which the experimental manipulation or intervention actually engaged the hypothesized target(s); and 4) testing the degree to which target engagement produces the desired change in health behaviors or clinical outcomes. for more information about the sobc program, please visit the science of behavior change website. the purposes of this approach are to increase the contributions of each intervention study to a cumulative science of behavior change, to allow for mechanisms-based design of doc behavior change interventions, and to facilitate testing of whether mechanisms-based interventions improve doc health. applications for nidcr support of clinical trials research are expected to incorporate an experimental medicine approach. applications that do not include an experimental medicine approach to behavior change must provide a strong justification for not doing so.scope of this ug3/uh3 foaclinical trial planning phase (ug3)the ug3 award will provide up to 2 years of support for scientific and operational planning activities necessary to conduct the clinical trial. the ug3 planning phase should incorporate all activities required—and not yet completed--to prepare for conduct of a subsequent clinical trial (i.e., intervention or basic experimental study with humans).when not yet already completed, at a minimum, ug3 planning activities should include the following activities, included as ug3 milestones:measurement of target engagement: applications should include plans to measure the hypothesized intervention target(s) and the degree to which the intervention engaged (e.g., changed) the target(s). for instance, if a study intends to test an intervention meant to increase self-efficacy for oral hygiene, the ug3 phase should demonstrate that the study changes in self-efficacy in response to the intervention can be accurately measured.acceptability and feasibility of the study intervention(s) or procedures: if acceptability and/or feasibility of the intervention has not yet been established in the study population, the ug3 phase should propose activities necessary to ensure acceptability and feasibility. relevant stage i activities may include consultation with stakeholders, delivery of the intervention to gather feedback from participants and providers, and/or other activities. in addition to the acceptability and feasibility of the study intervention(s), planning activities should establish the acceptability and feasibility of proposed study procedures. if not already established, the ug3 planning phase should include pilot-testing of study procedures, such as participant recruitment, methods of data collection, interventionist training procedures, and other key aspects of study conduct.finalization of agreements for use of resources available within ctsas, practice-based research networks, patient, registries, etc., as applicable.finalization of the clinical protocol and other required study documentation: to ensure adherence to the principles of good clinical practice (international conference on harmonisation (ich) e6), required documentation will include a clinical protocol, clinical quality management plan, data quality management plan, and participant consent/assent forms and procedures. for some studies, additional documentation may be required; for instance, a manual of operations is typically required for multi-site studies where site-level procedures may vary. applications should describe plans for developing relevant study documentation that will require nidcr review and approval before progressing to the uh3 phase.development of fidelity monitoring procedures: monitoring the degree to which a study intervention is delivered as it was intended to be delivered (i.e., with fidelity) is expected at every stage of intervention development; although the way fidelity data is used differs depending on the stage of intervention development and the associated research question(s). for instance, in stages of intervention development where efficacy is being established, fidelity monitoring is used to ensure intervention fidelity, and to identify interventionists who may need re-training. for studies in later stages of intervention development where efficacy has already been established, and research questions concern effectiveness or implementation, fidelity data may be used to identify challenges to intervention delivery. if methods for monitoring the fidelity of intervention delivery are not already established, ug3 planning activities should include the development of these methods.completion of the data management systemfinalization of all materials required for regulatory approvals (irb and applicable oversight committees)finalization of any other documents necessary to implement the trialclinical trial implementation phase (uh3)the uh3 award will provide up to 5 years of support to conduct the clinical trial in accordance with activities planned in the ug3 phase, and is contingent upon successful completion of the ug3 milestones. the nidcr expects clinical trials supported during the uh3 phase to be hypothesis driven, milestone-defined, and to contribute meaningfully to a cumulative science of behavior change within the research mission of the nidcr. the clinical trial must meet all applicable nih, and office of human research protections (ohrp) policy requirements.at a minimum, uh3 activities should include the following operational activities, expressed as uh3 milestones:see section viii. other information for award authorities and regulations.cooperative agreement: a support mechanism used when there will be substantial federal scientific or programmatic involvement. substantial involvement means that, after award, nih

in support of the nih mission are evaluated for scientific and technical merit through the nih peer review system.a proposed clinical trial application may include study design, methods, and intervention that are not by themselves innovative but address important questions or unmet needs. additionally, the results of the clinical trial may indicate that further clinical development of the intervention is unwarranted or lead to new avenues of scientific investigation.reviewers will provide an overall impact score to reflect their assessment of the likelihood for the project to exert a sustained, powerful influence on the research field(s) involved, in consideration of the following review criteria and additional review criteria (as applicable for the project proposed).reviewers will consider each of the review criteria below in the determination of scientific merit, and give a separate score for each. an application does not need to be strong in all categories to be judged likely to have major scientific impact. for example, a project that by its nature is not innovative may be essential to advance a field.does the project address an important problem or a critical barrier to progress in the field? is the prior research that serves as the key support for the proposed project rigorous? if the aims of the project are achieved, how will scientific knowledge,

requires federal award making officials to review and consider information about an applicant in the designated integrity and performance system (currently fapiis) prior to making an award. an applicant, at its option, may review information in the designated integrity and performance systems accessible through fapiis and comment on any information about itself that a federal agency previously entered and is currently in fapiis. the federal awarding agency will consider any comments by the applicant, in addition to other information in fapiis, in making a judgement about the applicant’s integrity, business ethics, and record of performance under federal awards when completing the review of risk posed by applicants as described in 45 cfr part 75.205 “federal awarding agency review of risk posed by applicants.” this provision will apply to all nih grants and cooperative agreements except fellowships.the following special terms of award are in addition to, and not in lieu of, otherwise applicable u.s. office of management and budget (omb) administrative guidelines, u.s. department of health and human services (dhhs) grant administration regulations at 45 cfr part 75, 2 cfr part 200, and other hhs, phs, and nih grant administration policies.the administrative and funding instrument used for this program will be the cooperative agreement, an "assistance" mechanism (rather than an "acquisition" mechanism), in which substantial nih programmatic involvement with the recipients is anticipated during the performance of the activities. under the cooperative agreement, the nih purpose is to support and stimulate the recipients' activities by involvement in and otherwise working jointly with the award recipients in a partnership role; it is not to assume direction, prime responsibility, or a dominant role in the activities. consistent with this concept, the dominant role and prime responsibility resides with the awardees for the project as a whole, although specific tasks and activities may be shared among the awardees and the nih as defined below.the pd(s)/pi(s) will have the following primary responsibilities:* all aspects of the study, including any modification of study design, conduct of the study, quality control, data analysis and interpretation, preparation of publications, dissemination of data, tools, and technologies, and collaboration with other investigators are the pd(s)/pi(s) responsibilities. the recipient agrees to accept close coordination, cooperation, and participation of nidcr staff in those aspects of scientific and technical management of the study as stated in these terms and conditions.the pd(s)/pi(s) will retain custody of and have primary rights to the data and software developed under these awards, subject to government rights of access consistent with current hhs, phs, and nih policies.nih staff will have the following primary responsibilities:an nidcr program staff member(s) acting as a project scientist(s) will be assigned to have substantial programmatic involvement that is above and beyond the normal stewardship role in awards, as described below. additional nidcr staff members may be designated to have substantial involvement. the nidcr project scientist(s) and any other substantially involved staff members will not attend peer review meetings of renewal (competing continuation) and/or supplemental applications. if such participation is deemed essential, these individuals will seek nidcr waiver according to the nidcr procedures for management of conflict of interest. some program officials will also have substantial programmatic involvement. in that case, the individual involved will not attend peer review meetings of renewal (competing continuation) and/or supplemental applications or will seek an nidcr waiver as stated above.the main activities of the nidcr substantially involved staff members include but are not limited to the following aspects:an nidcr program official will be responsible for the normal scientific and programmatic stewardship of the award and will be named in the award notice. an nidcr medical or dental officer will monitor the studies and serve as the medical monitor.the nidcr reserves the right to terminate, temporarily suspend, or modify a study or any portion of a study in the event of (a) failure to implement the study protocol, (b) a substantial shortfall in participant recruitment, follow-up, data reporting and dissemination, quality control or other major breach of the protocol, (c) substantive changes in the agreed-upon protocol with which the nidcr does not concur, (d) reaching a major study objective substantially before schedule with persuasive statistical evidence, or human subject ethical issues that may dictate a premature termination.data management and sharingnote: the nih policy for data management and sharing is effective for due dates on or after january 25, 2023.consistent with the nih policy for data management and sharing, when data management and sharing is applicable to the award, recipients will be required to adhere to the data management and sharing requirements as outlined in the nih grants policy statement. upon the approval of a data management and sharing plan, it is required for recipients to implement the plan as described.when multiple years are involved, recipients will be required to submit the research performance progress report (rppr) annually and financial statements as required in the nih grants policy statement.a final rppr, invention statement, and the expenditure data portion of the federal financial report are required for closeout of an award, as described in the nih grants policy statement.the federal funding accountability and transparency act of 2006 (transparency act), includes a requirement for recipients of federal grants to report information about first-tier subawards and executive compensation under federal assistance awards issued in fy2011 or later. all recipients of applicable nih grants and cooperative agreements are required to report to the federal subaward reporting system (fsrs) available at www.fsrs.gov on all subawards over $25,000. see the nih grants policy statement for additional information on this reporting requirement.in accordance with the regulatory requirements provided at 45 cfr 75.113 and appendix xii to 45 cfr part 75, recipients that have currently active federal grants, cooperative agreements, and procurement contracts from all federal awarding agencies with a cumulative total value greater than $10,000,000 for any period of time during the period of performance of a federal award, must report and maintain the currency of information reported in the system for award management (sam) about civil, criminal, and administrative proceedings in connection with the award or performance of a federal award that reached final disposition within the most recent five-year period. the recipient must also make semiannual disclosures regarding such proceedings. proceedings information will be made publicly available in the designated integrity and performance system (currently fapiis). this is a statutory requirement under section 872 of public law 110-417, as amended (41 u.s.c. 2313). as required by section 3010 of public law 111-212, all information posted in the designated integrity and performance system on or after april 15, 2011, except past performance reviews required for federal procurement contracts,
