research on the efficacy of interventions that address nutrition security and the mechanisms of food insecurity on a variety of health outcomes. it also calls for the development of new measures for nutrition security and assessment of food insecurity that are broadly applicable. . it was developed by the office of nutrition research (onr) implementation working group on nutrition and health disparities in collaboration with nih institutes and centers (ics) and offices in support of the goals and objectives of the strategic plan for nih nutrition research.backgroundimagine a world without hunger, in which all individuals, families, and communities have ready access to enough affordable, nutritious food to sustain a happy and healthy life. the goal is urgent with levels of hunger, worsened by a weak supply chain that restricts access of nutritious food to underserved populations. the result is a rising incidence of food and nutrition insecurity, which like hunger, stems from many factors beyond food and aligns with lack of access to life-enhancing resources.food insecurity — defined as the lack of consistent access to enough food for an active, healthy life — is a major public health concern and was exacerbated due to high rates of unemployment and reduction in work hours during the covid-19 pandemic. in 2020, the united states department of agriculture reported that 13.8 million us households (approximately 10.5 percent of all us households) experienced food insecurity. food insecurity is inextricably linked to poverty, with 35.3 percent of households with a household income to poverty ratio under 1 being food insecure. moreover, household food insecurity affected 14.8 percent of households with children and was particularly high in households headed by black (21.7 percent) or hispanic (17.2 percent) individuals. food insecurity has also been noted as a concern for additional subgroups such as the aging population, those that experience disabilities, and american indian/alaska native communities. related is the concept of nutrition security, which is defined as having consistent access, availability, and affordability of foods and beverages that promote well-being and prevent (and if needed, treat) disease, particularly among racial/ethnic minority populations, lower income populations, and rural and remote populations including tribal communities and insular areas (usda). this term is less documented in the research literature and there is no validated measure to assess nutrition security. this is therefore an opportunity for future research.food insecurity is related to suboptimal and/or poor diet quality, which increases chronic disease risk among the socioeconomically disadvantaged. several cross-sectional studies have shown that food insecure adults have lower nutrient intakes and lower healthy eating index scores compared with secure food adults, especially among those with lower incomes. consequently, food insecurity is associated with increased risk for nutrition-related negative outcomes, such as diabetes, obesity, hypertension, heart disease, and some cancers. although this association has been examined in the literature, the biological mechanisms are still poorly understood. in addition, there are major gaps in the literature on effective interventions that could mitigate the effects of food insecurity. therefore, it is important to increase our understanding regarding the influence of food insecurity on the onset and progression of chronic diseases.nutrition security and equitable access to healthy and affordable food in the u.s. are public health concerns. according to the usda, approximately 13.5 million people in the u.s. have limited access to supermarkets or large grocery stores impacting access to healthy foods. research shows higher diet quality is associated with proximity to and density of food stores, neighborhood socioeconomic status (ses), and perception of healthy food environments, especially for racial and ethnic minority populations. food environments, such as lack of access to grocery stores and the presence of fast food restaurants at the neighborhood level, are associated with increased risk of hypertension, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and cancer survival. elucidating the role of these social and environmental conditions on diet and nutritional status could help to prevent and manage diet-related health disparities and promote health equity. this is therefore an opportunity for future research to advance nutrition equity, including the broad categories below:some examples of appropriate studies include, but are not limited to, the following:development and testing of interventions, innovative programs, and natural experiments:identification of key risk factors and mechanistic pathways through epidemiological researchdevelopment, validation, and evaluation of tools to measure food insecurity and nutrition securityinterdisciplinary research teams (e.g., including behavioral scientists, nutrition researchers, academic physicians, economists, systems scientists, etc.) are encouraged.the office of nutrition research (onr) will convene annual virtual meetings which will serve as a forum to share study results, best practices for community engagement, and important lessons learned during the conduct of these studies. all awardees supported through this nosi are encouraged to attend these annual virtual meetings and should so indicate in the cover letter.non-responsive applications will not be reviewed and will be withdrawn from consideration for this initiative.applicants are strongly encouraged to reach out to the relevant scientific contacts to discuss whether their applications are responsive.specific areas of research interestfogarty international center (fic)fic is dedicated to advancing the mission of the nih by supporting and facilitating global health research conducted
