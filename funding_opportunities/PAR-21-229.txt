coordination, planning and strategic initiatives, office of research infrastructure programs (orip)r01 research project grantsee section iii. 3. additional information on eligibility.rapid advances in genotyping and next generation sequencing technologies have led to the identification of genetic variants that are associated with a wide variety of congenital defects including structural birth defects (sbds), intellectual developmental disabilities (idds) and inborn errors of metabolism (iems). large quantities of genomic data collected from pediatric birth defects cohorts are available to the research community through several databases such as the database of genotypes and phenotypes (dbgap), the gabriella miller kids first data resource portal, the european genome-phenome archive and clinical genome resource (clingen). the purpose of this initiative is to promote the screening, functional validation and characterization of birth defects-associated genetic variants identified through public facing databases and individual efforts using in-silico tools, appropriate animal models, in vitro systems or multi-pronged approaches. this initiative addresses a challenging gap between identifying sequence variations of potential interest and recognizing which of those variations have functional effects on the phenotype of interest.30 days prior to application due date(s)all applications are due by 5:00 pm local time of applicant organization. all types of non-aids applications allowed for this funding opportunity announcement are due on the listed date(s).applicants are encouraged to apply early to allow adequate time to make any corrections to errors found in the application during the submission process by the due date.not applicableit is critical that applicants follow the instructions in the research (r) instructions in the sf424 (r&r) application guide, except where instructed to do otherwise (in this foa or in a notice from nih guide for grants and contracts).conformance to all requirements (both in the application guide and the foa) is required and strictly enforced. applicants must read and follow all application instructions in the application guide as well as any program-specific instructions noted in section iv. when the program-specific instructions deviate from those in the application guide, follow the program-specific instructions.applications that do not comply with these instructions may be delayed or not accepted for review.there are several options available to submit your application through grants.gov to nih and department of health and human services partners. you must use one of these submission options to access the application forms for this opportunity.purpose/research objectivesrapid advances in genotyping and next generation sequencing technologies have led to the identification of genetic variants that are associated with a wide variety of congenital defects including structural birth defects (sbds), intellectual developmental disabilities (idds) and inborn errors of metabolism (iems). the purpose of this initiative is to promote the screening, functional validation and characterization of birth defects-associated genetic variants identified through public facing databases and individual efforts using in-silico tools, appropriate animal models, in vitro systems or multi-pronged approaches. the ultimate goal is to enhance the translation of basic knowledge gained from functional genomic approaches into the development of new, innovative, and efficacious strategies for the molecular diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of human birth defects.backgroundannually, almost five percent of all live births in the united states (more than 180,000 babies) involve babies born with birth defects when broadly defined to include both structural and functional/ metabolic abnormalities. birth defects are the leading cause of death in children within the first year of life and account for half of all pediatric hospitalizations. structural birth defects have a great impact on public health, socioeconomics, and family life.the genomic revolution holds promise for enabling the discovery of effective and targeted therapies based on the underlying genetic classification of conditions – the basis for precision medicine. studies of developmental biology are revealing the underlying genetic networks essential to cell/tissue differentiation, morphogenesis, organogenesis, as well as functions of cells and cellular organelles. disruptions in these fundamental developmental processes result in birth defects. the combined efforts of basic scientists studying the genetic networks and physician scientists sequencing patient cohorts together place the field of birth defects research on the verge of major advances.the nih has made significant investment in genomic studies and technologies to identify dna sequence variations associated with a wide variety of birth defects. among others, the gabriella miller kids first pediatric research program (kids first), the center for mendelian genomics (cmg), pediatric cardiac genomics consortium (pcgc), deciphering developmental disorders (ddd) and the undiagnosed disease network (udn) are generating large-scale clinical and genetic data from patients and their families with syndromic and organ-specific developmental disorders. data generated through whole genome sequencing, snp and sv analysis, and whole-exome sequencing are available to the research community through several databases such as the database of genotypes and phenotypes (dbgap), the kids first data resource portal, the european genome-phenome archive and clinvar.despite an explosion of data resources, researchers face a challenging gap between identifying birth defect-associated sequence variations and recognizing which of these variations have functional effects on the phenotype of interest. in order to pursue mechanistic studies of how specific genetic variants affect developmental pathways and gene networks leading to the observed phenotype, researchers must have effective methods to screen potential variants to identify the causal ones. faster, less expensive, and more accurate gene-to-function screens are critical for accelerating the translation of genomic findings into greater understanding of structural developmental disorders.scopethis initiative encourages screening and functional validation of genomic variants associated with birth defects and invites grant applications proposing to identify and prioritize genomic variants through in-silico analyses and/or cell-based assays, and followed by functional validation and deep mechanistic studies of causal variants in appropriate model systems.criteria for responsive applications:applicants may propose non-hypothesis driven screening of variants to establish association with birth defects under investigation, or hypothesis-driven mechanistic studies to generate critical information on how variant functions affect the disease phenotypes, or a combination of both types of studies.variant selection:model systems:novel and/or high throughput screening strategies to validate genomic variants may be based on:assays:providing multiple lines of convergent evidence supporting functionality using a combination of in silico, in vitro, and in vivo models is encouraged.applicants are encouraged to provide a timeline for achieving the major goals stated in the application and describe metrics for evaluating achievement of the goals and what action will be taken, and when, if a goal is not met or significantly delayed.non-responsive applications: projects with the following properties will be

data sharing plannichd plans for sharing human and non-human data and/or biospecimensnichd expects that data, biospecimens, and results of nichd-funded research will be shared with the wider scientific community to the extent feasible and in a timely manner. nih data sharing policy expects the timely release and sharing of data to be no later than the acceptance for publication of the main findings from the final dataset. all nichd applications, regardless of the amount of direct costs requested for any one year, are expected to include a sharing plan that addresses sharing of data as well as biospecimens, if applicable. ideally, this plan would include submitting data or biospecimens to an appropriate repository. these plans will also be considered by program staff as award decisions are being made as appropriate and consistent with achieving the goals of the program.specifically, for human data, the nichd encourages the use of the data and specimen hub (dash), a centralized resource for researchers to store and access de-identified data from studies funded by nichd. they can also submit information about the location and availability of biospecimens to dash, if applicable. submission of data to the nichd dash is one way that grantees may meet the requirements of the nih data sharing policy and make study data available for secondary analyses. information about dash may be obtained at https://dash.nichd.nih.gov/if use of dash is not feasible, nichd expects awardees to share data and/or biospecimens through other equivalent broad-sharing data and/or biospecimen repositories. for projects generating large-scale human genetic data, applicants should provide a provisional or institutional certification specifying whether the individual-level data can be shared through an nih approved repository, such as dbgap, in line with the nih genomic data sharing policy (https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/not-od-14-124.html).when involving
