information section iv. application and submission information section v. application review information section vi. award administration information section vii. agency contacts section viii. other informationdrug development tools (ddts) are methods, materials, or measures that can potentially facilitate drug development. to support ddt development efforts, fda established qualification programs for animal models for use under the regulations commonly referred to as the animal rule (see 21 cfr 314.600-650 for drugs and 21 cfr 601.90-95 for biological products), biomarkers, and clinical outcome assessments. examples of ddts may include but are not limited to: a biomarker used for clinical trial enrichment, a clinical outcome assessment (coa) used to evaluate clinical benefit, or an animal model used for efficacy testing of medical countermeasures under the animal rule.qualification is a conclusion that within the stated context of use, the ddt can be relied upon to have a specific interpretation and application in drug development and regulatory review under the fd&c act. qualification does not encompass the use of a ddt outside the context of use (cou) specified through the qualification process.once qualified, a ddt may be used within the qualified cou as part of any relevant drug or biologic investigational new drug application (ind), new drug application (nda) or biologic licensing application (bla) without submission of additional information to justify the use of the ddt. qualification of a ddt is voluntary, and the use of a qualified ddt is not required for drug or biologic development. however, having qualified ddts that can be used by multiple sponsors helps optimize drug development and evaluation. increased public availability of qualified ddts for specific contexts of use is anticipated to benefit the public health through (1) increased availability of effective drugs, (2) earlier access to medical therapies and (3) an enhanced knowledge of the drug under development. the qualification process allows for greater efficiency of development of ddts by promoting ddt development in the precompetitive arena through collaborative efforts such as public-private partnerships and consortia.these grants will be used to provide funding to developers of drug development tools that have an accepted letter of intent (loi) within cder/cber's drug development tool qualification program and are working towards to next qualification submission as described here: https://www.fda.gov/drugs/developmentapprovalprocess/drugdevelopmenttoolsqualificationprogram/ucm378219.htm and https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/qualification-process-drug-development-tools-guidance-industry-and-fda-staff. the grants will be used to further the development of tools that, once qualified, will be made publicly available to fill unmet needs in drug development. applicants should use the outline of the qualification plan (qp) or full qualification package (fqp) of the respective ddt program they are in, to assist in developing their grant application. funding will only support grantee's work towards either their qualification plan or full qualification package.as the duration of the grant is only for one year with a limited amount of budget, applicants are encouraged to focus the research strategy and the specific aims to fill the gaps for the subsequent qualification submission, rather than describing the entire development effort. limit the scope of the proposal to what you can achieve and deliver within the duration of the grant support. for example, you can focus on a component of the plan such as statistical analysis plan (sap) that requires additional work or addressing concerns identified during the discussions with fda.see section viii. other information for award authorities and regulations.cooperative agreement: a support mechanism used when there will be substantial federal scientific or programmatic involvement. substantial involvement means that, after award, fda scientific or program staff will assist, guide, coordinate, or participate in project activities. see section vi.2 for additional information about the substantial involvement for this foa.newthe oer glossary and the sf424 (r&r) application guide provide details on these application types. only those application types listed here are allowed for this foa.optional: accepting applications that either propose or do not propose clinical trial(s)clinical trials for ddt development are allowed provided that any therapies are

completeness and compliance with application instructions by the assigned grants management specialist and responsiveness by components of participating organizations, fda. applications that are incomplete, non-compliant and/or nonresponsive will not be reviewed.post-submission materials are those submitted after submission of the grant application but prior to objective review. they are not intended to correct oversights or errors discovered after submission of the application. fda accepts limited information between the time of initial submission of the application and the time of objective review. applicants must contact the assigned grants management specialist to receive approval, prior to submitting any post submission materials. acceptance and/or rejection of any post submission materials is at the sole discretion of the fda. any inquiries regarding post submission materials should be directed to the assigned grants management specialist.only the review criteria described below will be considered in the review process.reviewers will consider each of the review criteria below in the determination of scientific merit.does the project proposed address an important problem or a critical barrier to progress in the drug development? is there a strong scientific premise for the project? if the aims of the project are achieved, how will scientific knowledge, technical capability, clinical practice, and drug development process be improved? how will successful completion of the project change the current paradigm of assessments and accelerate the development of safe and effective medical products for the patients who need them the most?are the aims of the proposal well aligned with the scope of the ddt qualification program and of the current standing of the project based on the discussions with fda? is the proposal well developed to overcome the issues and roadblocks that currently hamper the progress of the project towards the ddt qualification? does the proposal adequately address prior questions from fda and is it consistent with prior inputs and recommendations from fda? if these aims are achieved successfully, does it enable the project to move towards to the next steps in the qualification? is there a plan in place to make this tool available, accepted and adopted widely by the communities?are the overall strategy, methodology, and analyses well-reasoned and appropriate to accomplish the specific aims of the project? have the investigators presented strategies to ensure a robust and unbiased approach, as appropriate for the work proposed? are potential problems, alternative strategies, and benchmarks for success presented? is the approach feasible, practical and implementable in the real world, technologically, logistically and economically? have the investigators presented adequate plans to deliver a preliminary progress at 6 months (a qp or fqp submission) and tangible results at the completion of the grant period (a reviewable qp or fqp)?are the pd(s)/pi(s), collaborators, and other researchers well suited to carry out the project? do they have a record of accomplishments that have advanced their field(s)? do they have strong credentials to achieve consensus or to bring accepted practices in the relevant research communities? e.g. creation and adaptation of new standards.are the investigators and collaborators assembled for this proposal complementary and have well-integrated expertise to overcome the identified roadblocks and to make significant progress towards the ddt qualification? e.g. execution of statistical analysis plan (sap), access to clinical data and other resources for validation etc.will the scientific environment in which the work will be done contribute to the probability of success? are the institutional support, equipment and other physical resources available to the investigators adequate for the project proposed? will the project benefit from unique features of the scientific environment, subject populations, or collaborative arrangements?as applicable for the project proposed, reviewers will evaluate the following additional items but will not give separate scores for these items and should not consider them in providing an overall score.for research that involves human subjects but does not involve one of the categories of research that are exempt under 45 cfr part 46, the committee will evaluate the justification for involvement of human subjects and the proposed protections from research risk relating to their participation according to the following five review criteria: 1) risk to subjects, 2) adequacy of protection against risks, 3) potential benefits to the subjects and others, 4) importance of the knowledge to be gained, and 5) data and safety monitoring for clinical trials.for research that involves human subjects and meets the criteria for one or more of the categories of research that are exempt under 45 cfr part 46, the committee will evaluate: 1) the justification for the exemption, 2) human subjects involvement and characteristics, and 3) sources of materials. for additional information on review of the human subjects section, please refer to the guidelines for the review of human subjects.when the proposed project involves human subjects and/or clinical research, the committee will evaluate the proposed plans for the inclusion (or exclusion) of individuals on the basis of sex/gender, race, and ethnicity, as well as the inclusion (or exclusion) of individuals of all ages (including children and older adults) to determine if it is justified in terms of the scientific goals and research strategy proposed. for additional information on review of the inclusion section, please refer to the guidelines for the review of inclusion in clinical research.the committee will evaluate the involvement of live vertebrate animals as part of the scientific assessment according to the following criteria: (1) description of proposed procedures involving animals, including species, strains, ages, sex, and total number to be used; (2) justifications for the use of animals versus alternative models and for the appropriateness of the species proposed; (3) interventions to minimize discomfort, distress, pain and injury; and (4) justification for euthanasia method if not consistent with the avma guidelines for the euthanasia of animals. reviewers will assess the use of chimpanzees as they would any other application proposing the use of vertebrate animals. for additional information on review of the vertebrate animals section, please refer to the worksheet for review of the vertebrate animal section.reviewers will assess whether materials or procedures proposed are potentially hazardous to research personnel and/or the environment, and if needed, determine whether adequate protection is proposed.not applicablenot applicablenot applicablereviewers will assess the information provided in this section of the application, including 1) the select agent(s) to be used in the proposed research, 2) the registration status of all entities where select agent(s) will be used, 3) the procedures that will be used to monitor possession use and transfer of select agent(s), and 4) plans for appropriate biosafety, biocontainment, and security of the select

model organisms; and (3) genomic data sharing plan (gds).for projects involving key biological and/or chemical resources, reviewers will comment on the brief plans proposed for identifying and ensuring the validity of those resources.reviewers will consider whether the budget and the requested period of support are fully justified and reasonable in relation to the proposed research.applications will be evaluated for scientific and technical merit by (an) appropriate objective review committee using the stated review criteria.as part of the objective review, all applications:appeals of objective review will not be accepted for applications submitted in response to this foa.applications will compete for available funds with all other recommended applications submitted in response to this foa. the following will be considered in making funding decisions:successful applicants will be notified of additional information that may be required or other actions leading to an award. the decision not to award a grant, or to award a grant at a particular funding level, is discretionary and is not subject to appeal to any fda or hhs official or board.a formal notification in the form of a notice of award (noa) will be provided to the applicant organization for successful applications. the noa signed by the grants management officer is the authorizing document and will be sent via email to the recipient’s business official.awardees must comply with any funding restrictions described in section iv.5. funding restrictions and in the notice of award. selection of an application for award is not an authorization to begin performance. any costs incurred before receipt of the noa are at the recipient's risk. these costs may be reimbursed only to the extent considered allowable pre-award costs.any application awarded in response to this foa will be subject to terms and conditions found in the hhs grants policy statement, this foa, and notice of award.institutional review board or independent ethics committee approval: for projects that involve human subjects and/or clinical trials research, recipient institutions must ensure that protocols are reviewed by their irb or iec. to help ensure the safety of participants enrolled in fda-funded studies, the awardee must provide fda copies of documents related to all major changes in the status of ongoing protocols.all fda grant and cooperative agreement awards include the hhs grants policy statement as part of the noa.recipients of federal financial assistance (ffa) from hhs must administer their programs in compliance with federal civil rights laws that prohibit discrimination on the basis of race, color, national origin, disability, age and, in some circumstances, religion, conscience, and sex. this includes ensuring programs are accessible to persons with limited english proficiency. the hhs office for civil rights provides guidance on complying with civil rights laws enforced by hhs. please see https://www.hhs.gov/civil-rights/for-providers/provider-obligations/index.html and http://www.hhs.gov/ocr/civilrights/understanding/section1557/index.html.hhs recognizes that research projects are often limited in scope for many reasons that are nondiscriminatory, such as the principal investigator’s scientific interest, funding limitations, recruitment requirements, and other considerations. thus, criteria in research protocols that target or exclude certain populations are warranted where nondiscriminatory justifications establish that such criteria are appropriate with respect to the health or safety of the subjects, the scientific study design, or the purpose of the research. for additional guidance regarding how the provisions apply to fda grant programs, please contact the scientific/research contact that is identified in section vii under agency contacts of this foa.please contact the hhs office for civil rights for more information about obligations and prohibitions under federal civil rights laws at https://www.hhs.gov/ocr/about-us/contact-us/index.html or call 1-800-368-1019 or tdd 1-800-537-7697.in accordance with the statutory provisions contained in section 872 of the duncan hunter national defense authorization act of fiscal year 2009 (public law 110-417), fda awards will be subject to the federal awardee performance and integrity information system (fapiis) requirements. fapiis requires federal award making officials to review and consider information about an applicant in the designated integrity and performance system (currently fapiis) prior to making an award. an applicant, at its option, may review information in the designated integrity and performance systems accessible through fapiis and comment on any information about itself that a federal agency previously entered and is currently in fapiis. the federal awarding agency will consider any comments by the applicant, in addition to other information in fapiis, in making a judgement about the applicant’s integrity, business ethics, and record of performance under federal awards when completing the review of risk posed by applicants as described in 45 cfr part 75.205 “federal awarding agency review of risk posed by applicants.” this provision will apply to all fda grants and cooperative agreements.fda considers the sharing of research resources developed through fda-sponsored research an important means to enhance the value and further the advancement of research. when research resources have been developed with fda funds and the associated research findings published, those findings must be made readily available to the scientific community.upon acceptance for publication, scientific researchers must submit the author’s final manuscript of the peer-reviewed scientific publication resulting from research supported in whole or in part with fda funds to the nih national library of medicine's (nlm) pubmed central (pmc). fda defines the author's final manuscript as the final version accepted for journal publication, which includes all modifications from the publishing peer review process. the pmc archive is the designated repository for these manuscripts for use by the public, health care providers, educators, scientists, and fda. please see the fda public access policy.additional terms and conditions regarding fda regulatory and cber/cder programmatic requirements may be part of the notice of award.reporting requirements:all fda grants require both financial and performance reporting.financial reporting:a. cash transaction
