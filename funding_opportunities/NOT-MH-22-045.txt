diversity specialized predoctoral to postdoctoral advancement in neuroscience (d-span) award (f99/k00 clinical trial not allowed)national institute of mental health (nimh)nimh is issuing this notice of special interest (nosi) to highlight interest in research to analyze existing and accumulating data to aid in refining phenotypes of posttraumatic psychopathology(ies), markers of onset and change, and risk detection. nimh is also interested in research using available data to identify potential prevention and treatment targets and to advance and refine measurement and validation of potential novel targets for future development in experimental therapeutics research.backgroundhistorically, the manifestation of mental health problems following traumatic stress exposure has been considered largely under the umbrella of post-traumatic stress disorder (ptsd). however, there is high variability in presentation and frequent comorbidity with other conditions including depression, anxiety disorders, substance abuse, and a variety of other symptoms. comorbidity and variability in presentation of patients post trauma is the rule, rather than the exception. given the current limited ability to predict posttraumatic outcomes, match interventions to risk, and treat the underlying causes of specific dysfunction and disorder, research involving persons exposed to traumatic events can improve understanding in these areas.in response to a traumatic event, people commonly report a range of acute symptoms, e.g., hyperarousal, avoidance, re-experiencing, and changes in thoughts and mood. quickly, many individuals progressively improve, and symptoms recede. those who continue to experience distress may develop diagnosable mental health problems, including ptsd and other conditions- which may become chronic. however, scientists and clinicians lack the ability to predict, at an individual level, who will suffer from mental health problems and who will recover naturally after trauma exposure. variability within those diagnosed contributes to poor prediction and inconsistent treatment response. further evidence of heterogeneity in ptsd is that response to the best evidence-based treatment is highly variable. patients ostensibly suffering from the same disorder often respond differently to empirically supported treatments (both psychological and pharmacological). why some but not other patients derive benefits is largely unknown. emerging data from neuroimaging, neurochemistry, physiological, cognitive and behavioral studies reveal significant differences in systems related to arousal, memory, and reward in those experiencing maladaptive responses to trauma and may help reveal the mechanisms that give rise to eventual clinical presentations. novel interventions are needed and may be both developed and targeted to those who would most benefit.nimh, with partner departments of defense and veterans affairs, created a set of common data elements for research in the traumatic stress space. nimh has made the depositing and sharing of research data through the nimh data archive (nda) routine. data characterizing alterations (cognitive, behavioral, physiological, neurobiological, etc.) after exposure to traumatic events and pre-existing vulnerabilities are accumulating and increasingly available for integrated analyses. for example, in addition to more typical size or scope research projects (e.g., nda #2297, nda #2541, nda #2527), nimh supported a substantial initiative (the aurora study) to collect longitudinal data from an acutely traumatized cohort of adults presenting in emergency rooms and followed for up to a year with assessment across domains and levels of functioning. there is substantial opportunity to leverage data available in nda and other large private and public databases to advance the understanding, prevention, and treatment of posttraumatic psychopathology.research objectivesto advance research through analysis of existing and accumulating data alone or in combination with new data, nimh is encouraging submission of applications to leverage available data related to posttraumatic psychopathology in nda and other public and private databases to address the following areas of scientific interest:training applicants, junior investigators, and established investigators are all encouraged under this nosi. applicants are encouraged to consider the most appropriate foa for the scope of the research proposed and the pi career stage.areas that are lower priority for this nosi
