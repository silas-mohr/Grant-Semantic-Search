(original expiration date: february 16, 2024 )not applicableit is critical that applicants follow the instructions in the research (r) instructions in the sf424 (r&r) application guide, except where instructed to do otherwise (in this foa or in a notice from nih guide for grants and contracts).conformance to all requirements (both in the application guide and the foa) is required and strictly enforced. applicants must read and follow all application instructions in the application guide as well as any program-specific instructions noted in section iv. when the program-specific instructions deviate from those in the application guide, follow the program-specific instructions.applications that do not comply with these instructions may be delayed or not accepted for review.there are several options available to submit your application through grants.gov to nih and department of health and human services partners. you must use one of these submission options to access the application forms for this opportunity.purpose/research objectives:this funding opportunity announcement (foa) invites applications for cutting-edge basic research awards (cebra) to foster highly innovative and/or conceptually creative research that advances our understanding of the etiology, pathophysiology, prevention, or treatment of substance use disorders (suds). while nida supports innovative biomedical research relevant to suds and related health problems such as hiv and other comorbidities, the cebra program represents the high priority nida places on fostering transformative and innovative research approaches. cebra is specifically designed to support high-risk and potentially high-impact research that is underrepresented or not included in nida's current portfolio. it is not intended for incremental research or research extending ongoing programs. there is enormous potential for advances when knowledge is generated and combined in new and unexpected ways. therefore, this announcement encourages applications from investigators with experience in sud-relevant research who wish to explore and develop new methods, techniques or conceptual frameworks to study basic questions in this research area. it also encourages applications from investigators with expertise in fields other than suds who wish to establish innovative research programs in this area or to develop new approaches, techniques or technologies that have the potential for high-impact applications in sud and related research.the r21 mechanism supports projects that have a strong rationale and conceptual framework, but are in the early, first stages of development where there are little or no preliminary data. the cebra r21 program is not intended for large-scale undertakings or to support or supplement ongoing research. applications submitted under this mechanism should be exploratory, novel, and describe projects distinct from those supported through the traditional r01 mechanism. the research proposed in a cebra application should break new ground or extend previous discoveries toward new directions or applications. for the cebra program, "basic research" is broadly inclusive. cebra applications will be considered for all nida divisions.special features of the cebra includeresearch objectives:pharmacological, neurobiological, behavioral, cellular, and genetic research has provided rich insight into how addictive drugs exert their actions on the brain and other organs. neurobiological, behavioral and cognitive studies have shown how addictive drugs affect behavior and information processing in the brain, and have helped to elucidate the normal behavioral and neurobiological processes that are "hijacked" by addictive substances. they have also helped us understand motivational aspects of suds and other relevant behaviors, emotional regulation, and decision-making processes. genetic, epigenetic, and single cell studies have delineated genes, proteins, and epigenetic factors that modulate responses to drug exposures. they have also demonstrated key alleles, genes, and epigenetic modifications associated with various aspects of substance use disorders and demonstrated that there are genetic differences underlying consumption compared with problematic consequences.basic science discoveries have consistently been the basis for many major advances in both clinical and applied sud research and have contributed to the development and implementation of successful treatment strategies for suds and associated behavioral phenotypes. basic research has also led to the discovery of new targets for medications, non-addictive treatments for pain, the development of technologies that enhance prevention and treatment programs for suds, and new approaches for statistical analysis of epidemiological and clinical trials data.basic research to establish new animal models and new methods to synthesize small molecules and immunotherapies has supported the development of new medications to treat suds. basic research has also addressed how addictive substances interact with viral infections such as hiv, hbv, and hcv. in addition, technologies and approaches, such as nanobiology, bioengineering, epigenomics, computational science, imaging methods and optogenetics have had a significant impact on cutting-edge research. however, there is still a need to increase our understanding of suds and related disorders through basic research in all these areas in order to develop effective diagnostic, treatment and prevention interventions to alleviate the pain and devastation of addiction.the goal of nida's cebra program is to accelerate the pace of discoveries to advance addiction research by encouraging scientifically sound applications that focus on innovation. the cebra encourages researchers to explore new approaches, test imaginative new ideas, and challenge existing paradigms in drug addiction research.we encourage the development of:the cebra program will support high-risk, high impact research that: (1) tests an innovative and significant hypothesis for which there are scant precedent or preliminary data and which, if confirmed, would transform current thinking; or (2) develops, and/or adapts, revolutionary techniques or methods for addiction research or that show promising future applicability to sud research.special considerations:national advisory council on drug abuse recommended guidelines for the administration of drugs to human subjects: the national advisory council on drug abuse (nacda) recognizes the importance of research involving the administration of drugs with abuse potential, and dependence or addiction liability, to human subjects. potential applicants are encouraged to obtain and review these recommendations of council before submitting an application that will administer compounds to human subjects.points to consider regarding tobacco industry funding of nida applicants: the national advisory council on drug abuse (nacda) encourages nida and its grantees to consider the points it has set forth with regard to existing or prospective sponsored research agreements with tobacco companies or their related entities and the impact of acceptance of tobacco industry funding on nida's credibility and reputation within the scientific community.data harmonization for substance abuse and addiction via the phenx toolkit: nida strongly encourages investigators involved in human-subjects studies to employ a common set of tools and resources that will promote the collection of comparable data across studies and to do so by incorporating the measures from the core and specialty collections, which are available in the substance abuse and addiction collection of the phenx toolkit (www.phenxtoolkit.org). please see not-da-12-008 for further details.design, analysis, and sample size for studies to evaluate group-based interventions: investigators who wish to evaluate the effect of an intervention on a health-related biomedical or behavioral outcome may propose a study in which (1) groups or clusters are assigned to study arms and individual observations are analyzed to evaluate the effect of the intervention, or (2) participants are assigned individually to study arms but receive at least some of their intervention in a real or virtual group or through a shared facilitator. such studies may propose a parallel group- or cluster-randomized trial, an individually randomized group-treatment trial, a stepped-wedge design, or a quasi-experimental version of one of these designs. in these studies, special methods may be warranted for analysis and sample size estimation. applicants should show that their methods are appropriate given their plans for assignment of participants and delivery of interventions. additional information is available at nih research methods resources.see section viii. other information

resource sharing plan will not be evaluated at time of review.only the review criteria described below will be considered in the review process. applications submitted to the nih in support of the nih mission are evaluated for scientific and technical merit through the nih peer review system.for this particular announcement, note the following:the r21 exploratory/developmental grant supports investigation of novel scientific ideas or new model systems, tools, or technologies that have the potential for significant impact on biomedical or biobehavioral research. an r21 grant application need not have extensive background material or preliminary information. accordingly, reviewers will emphasize the conceptual framework, the level of innovation, and the potential to significantly advance our knowledge or understanding. appropriate justification for the proposed work can be provided through literature citations, data from other sources, or, when available, from investigator-generated data. preliminary data are not required for r21 applications; however, they may be included if available.the research proposed in cebra r21 applications should break new ground or extend previous discoveries toward new directions or applications. thus, the emphasis of the reviewer's evaluation should focus on 1. the significance and innovation of the proposed project, , and 2. the degree to which the proposed project fits into the category of high-risk, high-reward research that has the potential to transform our understanding of, develop new tools and technologies for, or markedly advance research on substance use disorders.in addition, for applications involving clinical trials: a proposed clinical trial application may include study design, methods, and intervention that are not by themselves innovative but address important questions or unmet needs. additionally, the results of the clinical trial may indicate that further clinical development of the intervention is unwarranted or lead to new avenues of scientific investigation.reviewers will provide an overall impact score to reflect their assessment of the likelihood for the project to exert a sustained, powerful influence on the research field(s) involved, in consideration of the following review criteria and additional review criteria (as applicable for the project proposed).reviewers will consider each of the review criteria below in the determination of scientific merit, and give a separate score for each. an application does not need to be strong in all categories to be judged likely to have major scientific impact. for example, a project that by its nature is not innovative may be essential to advance a field.does the project address an important problem or a critical barrier to progress in the field? is the prior research that serves as the key support for the proposed project rigorous? if the aims of the project are achieved, how will scientific knowledge, technical capability, and/or clinical practice be improved? how will successful completion of the aims change the concepts, methods, technologies, treatments, services, or preventative interventions
