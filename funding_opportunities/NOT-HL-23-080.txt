february 23, 2023pa-20-185 - nih research project grant (parent r01 clinical trial not allowed)rescinded not-hl-23-003 - notice of special interest (nosi): enhancing research on deciphering mechanisms of covid-19-associated coagulopathynational heart, lung, and blood institute (nhlbi)this notice of special interest (nosi) aims to accelerate a comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms of covid-19-associated coagulopathy (cac) which are provoked by vascular endothelial cell injury, hyperimmune responses, and hypercoagulability at genomic, molecular, and cellular levels.knowledge obtained from such studies may be applied to the future design of early diagnostics and effective treatment for high-risk patients as well as enable cac research findings to be applied to on-going covid-19 clinical trials.backgroundthe incidence of thrombosis in covid-19 icu patients is estimated to be 20-30%. one of the most striking complications of covid-19 is acute large vessel occlusion with ischemic stroke in patients under 50 years of age. rates of venous thromboembolism (vte) also appear markedly elevated (between 25-49%) in patients with severe covid-19. these patients frequently exhibit a heavily prothrombotic state with elevated c-reactive protein, d-dimer, p-selectin and fibrin(ogen) levels, but, paradoxically, with little change in partial thromboplastin time, prothrombin time, or significant decline in platelet levels. this represents a unique pattern of biomarkers which distinguishes cac from classical disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (dic). the aforementioned lab findings in combination with an arterial and/or venous thromboembolic event in a patient with covid-19 is known as cac.presently, cac is postulated to result from the interaction between damaged vascular endothelial layers, the immune response, and the coagulation system, resulting in dysregulation of the finely balanced procoagulant/fibrinolytic state. however, the mechanisms linking inflammation in covid-19 patients to dysregulated hemostasis and thrombosis are yet to be delineated. hypercoagulability may also be linked to confounding factors such as underlying comorbidities as well as sex and age of patients. therefore, a better understanding of the pathogenesis of cac at the genomic, molecular and cellular levels is needed to identify and diagnose patients at risk for cac, to pinpoint potential therapeutic targets, and to mitigate sequelae of cac events.research objectivesthis nosi will support research that focuses on the basic mechanisms of covid-19 associated thrombosis ranging from vascular endothelial cell injury, the host immune responses, to the coagulation and fibrinolysis systems. identifying risk factors, or co-morbidities that predispose patients to cac are also of interest.the scientific objectives of this nosi include:applicants are encouraged to establish collaborations among researchers with a multi-disciplinary background, such as cell biology, molecular biology, immunology, hematology, virology, systems biology, multi-omics, and data science.research areas of interest include, but are not limited to:applications aiming to study involvement of cac in post-acute sequelae of sars cov-2 infections should consider applying to not-od-22-038 notice of special interest (nosi): availability of administrative supplements for research
