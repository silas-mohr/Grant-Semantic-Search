september 22 and september 30, 2022see section iii. 3. additional information on eligibility.the purpose of this funding opportunity announcement (foa) is to solicit applications for pilot projects to elucidate a role for understudied proteins associated with rare diseases. awards will support generation of preliminary data and/or tools around eligible understudied protein(s). a list of eligible proteins is provided and are members of druggable protein families that have a known association with a rare disease. this foa is intended to jumpstart research on understudied proteins that are associated with rare diseases and provide applicants with sufficient funding to perform basic biochemical and/or biological work to further the characterization of understudied proteins associated with rare disease.30 days prior to the application due dateall applications are due by 5:00 pm local time of applicant organization.applicants are encouraged to apply early to allow adequate time to make any corrections to errors found in the application during the submission process by the due date.not applicableit is critical that applicants follow the instructions in the research (r) instructions in the sf424 (r&r) application guide, except where instructed to do otherwise (in this foa or in a notice from nih guide for grants and contracts).conformance to all requirements (both in the application guide and the foa) is required and strictly enforced. applicants must read and follow all application instructions in the application guide as well as any program-specific instructions noted in section iv. when the program-specific instructions deviate from those in the application guide, follow the program-specific instructions.applications that do not comply with these instructions may be delayed or not accepted for review.there are several options available to submit your application through grants.gov to nih and department of health and human services partners. you must use one of these submission options to access the application forms for this opportunity.introductionthe national center for advancing translational sciences (ncats) at the national institutes of health (nih), is transforming the translational science process so that new treatments and cures for disease can be delivered to patients faster. ncats strives to develop innovations to reduce, remove or bypass costly and time-consuming bottlenecks in the translational research pipeline in an effort to speed the delivery of new drugs, diagnostics and medical devices to patients.this funding opportunity announcement (foa) aims to promote innovative research to increase knowledge of understudied proteins associated with rare diseases. the submission of small research grant (r03) applications is encouraged from institutions and organizations proposing projects leading to a better understanding of eligible proteins listed below.small research (r03) grants provide flexibility for initiating discrete, well-defined projects that realistically can be completed in one year and require only limited levels of funding. this program supports different types of projects including, but not limited to, the following:these awards will support generation of preliminary data and tools around eligible understudied protein(s) with the intent of elucidating the function of these proteins in the context of rare disease and obtaining sufficient preliminary data and/or research resources for subsequent grant applications and/or drug discovery projects. these grants are non-renewable.this funding opportunity announcement does not accept applications proposing clinical trial(s). background the human genome has revealed a great deal about the human proteome, though significant portions of the genome remain understudied. only a subset of expressed proteins demonstrates the requisite properties to serve as targets for the development of therapeutics. many bona fide drug targets likely remain to be studied in the “druggable proteome” (dp), which can be defined as the fraction of proteins which have the ability to bind drug-like molecules. the term "drug-like" refers to the physical, biochemical, and pharmacological attributes of small molecule compounds that are generally recognized to be required for efficacious clinical drugs in humans. while the number of proteins in the dp is upwards of 4,500, the existing clinical pharmacopeia is represented by only a few hundred targets, leaving a huge swath of druggable biology unexploited.the expanded exploration of the relationship between the protein and the rare disease phenotype, or the development of a useful tool or reagent can accelerate research into a previously understudied protein. many interesting and critical biological processes and potential therapeutic avenues remain unexplored because an initial catalyzing event (e.g., association with a biologic process or phenotype, creation of tools or reagents for the protein, etc.) has not yet occurred. the purpose of this foa is to spark such catalyzing events through the support of small r03 awards to identify novel drug targets for the treatment of human disease, specifically rare diseaseobjectives and scopethe goal of this specific solicitation is to provide a needed opportunity for the collection of preliminary data around the role of understudied proteins associated with rare diseases. this foa will provide funding to support research that will characterize new targets for treatment of human disease among the understudied proteins of the druggable proteome. these projects should be carried out in a short period of time with limited resources as defined by the funding mechanism.it has been recognized through workshops and publications that understudied proteins become “illuminated” when (1) there are tools to study the protein (e.g., tools that modulate protein activity) and/or (2) there is biochemical, cellular, or animal model evidence of disease/physiological relevance. this foa was developed to address the need for expanded research and validation experiments on eligible understudied protein(s), with the intent of producing preliminary data to address the lack of biochemical, cellular, or animal model data associated with many understudied proteins. it is expected that the award will be used to obtain preliminary data and/or research resources for subsequent grant applications and/or drug discovery projects.the nih supports research on a broad range of diseases that are defined as rare; that is diseases affecting fewer than 200,000 individuals in the united states (per the rare disease act of 2002). collectively, there are an estimated 7,000 rare diseases, which affect approximately 25-30 million people in the united states. most are serious or life-threatening, with a disproportionate number of rare diseases affecting children. at this time, effective treatments are available for fewer than 5%. the idg program has linked over 6,000 proteins to rare diseases, with over 80% of these proteins considered extremely understudied. for the purposes of this foa, eligible proteins are those that have an association with rare disease through data mining of the encyclopedia of rare disease annotations for precision medicine (eram) and orphanet, are considered understudied (those proteins that lack small molecule binders and/or have limited biological characterization) and are within a protein family that is traditionally considered druggable.proteins open for study under this foa:enzymes:arsa, arsb, arse, atad3a, btd, ddah2, dtx1, dtx4, eral1, ethe1, fancl, galns, gch1, gns, hace1, hecw1, huwe1, itch, mex3c, mib1, mib2, mkrn3,

will not be evaluated at time of review.only the review criteria described below will be considered in the review process. applications submitted to the nih in support of the nih mission are evaluated for scientific and technical merit through the nih peer review system.for this particular announcement, note the following:the r03 small grant supports discrete, well-defined projects that realistically can be completed in one year and that require limited levels of funding. because the research project usually is limited, an r03 grant application may not contain extensive detail or discussion. accordingly, reviewers should evaluate the conceptual framework and general approach to the problem. this foa is intended to jumpstart research on understudied proteins that are associated with rare diseases and provide applicants with funding to perform basic biochemical and/or biological work to further the characterization of understudied proteins associated with a rare disease. preliminary data are not required, particularly in applications proposing pilot or feasibility studies and appropriate justification for the proposed work can be provided through literature citations, data from other sources, or from investigator-generated data.overall impactreviewers will provide an overall impact score to reflect their assessment of the likelihood for the project to exert a sustained, powerful influence on the research field(s) involved, in consideration of the following review criteria and additional review criteria (as applicable for the project proposed).scored review criteriareviewers will consider each of the review criteria below in the determination of scientific merit and give a separate score for each. an application does not need to be strong in all categories to be judged likely to have major scientific impact. for example, a project that by its nature is not innovative may be essential to advance a field.significancedoes the project address an important problem or a critical barrier to progress in the field? is the prior research that serves as the key support for the proposed project rigorous? if the aims of the project are achieved, how will scientific knowledge, technical capability, and/or clinical practice be improved? how will successful completion of the aims change the concepts, methods, technologies, treatments, services, or preventative interventions that drive this field?specific to this foa:to what extent does the project help to elucidate the function and/or structure of the understudied protein(s) in relevant models that will ultimately inform human conditions? how will the project address critical barriers to understanding the role of understudied proteins in fundamental physiology, in disease processes, and/or as novel therapeutic targets? in what way does the stated hypothesis provide sufficient justification to indicate why the approach was chosen?investigator(s)are the pd(s)/pi(s), collaborators, and other researchers well suited to the project? if early stage investigators or those in the early stages of independent careers, do they have appropriate experience and training? if established, have they demonstrated an ongoing record of accomplishments that have advanced their field(s)? if the project is collaborative or multi-pd/pi, do the investigators have complementary and integrated expertise; are their leadership approach, governance, and organizational structure appropriate for the project?innovationdoes the application challenge and seek to shift current research or clinical practice paradigms by utilizing novel theoretical concepts, approaches or methodologies, instrumentation, or interventions? are the concepts, approaches or methodologies, instrumentation, or interventions novel to one field of research or novel in a broad sense? is a refinement, improvement, or new application of theoretical concepts, approaches or methodologies, instrumentation, or interventions proposed?approachare the overall strategy, methodology, and analyses well-reasoned and appropriate to accomplish the specific aims of the project? have the investigators included plans to address weaknesses in the rigor of prior research that serves as the key support for the proposed project? have the investigators presented strategies to ensure a robust and unbiased approach, as appropriate for the work proposed? are potential problems, alternative strategies, and benchmarks for success presented? if the project is in the early stages of development, will the strategy establish feasibility and will particularly risky aspects be managed? have the investigators presented adequate plans to address relevant biological variables, such as sex, for studies in vertebrate animals or human subjects?if the project involves human subjects and/or nih-defined clinical research, are the plans to address 1) the protection of human subjects from research risks, and 2) inclusion (or exclusion) of individuals on the basis of sex/gender, race, and ethnicity, as well as the inclusion or exclusion of individuals of all ages (including children and older adults), justified in terms of the scientific goals and research strategy proposed?specific to this foa: how will the proposed approach further characterize the understudied protein in the context of rare disease or enable such characterization (in instances where the focus is generation of reagents/tools)?environmentwill the scientific environment in which the work will be done contribute to the probability of success? are the institutional support, equipment, and other physical resources available to the investigators adequate for the project proposed? will the project benefit from unique features of the scientific environment, subject populations, or collaborative arrangements?additional review criteriaas applicable for the project proposed, reviewers will evaluate the following additional items while determining scientific and technical merit, and in providing an overall impact score, but will not give separate scores for these items.protections for human subjectsfor research that involves human subjects but does not involve one of the categories of research that are exempt under 45 cfr part 46, the committee will evaluate the justification for involvement of human subjects and the proposed protections from research risk relating to their participation according to the following five review criteria: 1) risk to subjects, 2) adequacy of protection against risks, 3) potential benefits to the subjects and others, 4) importance of the knowledge to be gained, and 5) data and safety monitoring for clinical trials.for research that involves human subjects and meets the criteria for one or more of the categories of research that are exempt under 45 cfr part 46, the committee will evaluate: 1) the justification for the exemption, 2) human subjects involvement and characteristics, and 3) sources of materials. for additional information on review of the human subjects section, please refer to the guidelines for the review of human subjects.inclusion of women, minorities, and individuals across the lifespanwhen the proposed project involves human subjects and/or nih-defined clinical research, the committee will evaluate the proposed plans for the inclusion (or exclusion) of individuals on the basis of sex/gender, race, and ethnicity, as well as the inclusion (or exclusion) of individuals of all ages (including children and older adults) to determine if it is justified in terms of the scientific goals and research strategy proposed. for additional information on review of the inclusion section, please refer to the guidelines for the review of inclusion in clinical research.vertebrate animalsthe committee will evaluate the involvement of live vertebrate animals as part of the scientific assessment according to the following criteria: (1) description of proposed procedures involving animals, including species, strains, ages, sex, and total number to be used; (2) justifications for the use of animals versus alternative models and for the appropriateness of the species proposed; (3) interventions to minimize discomfort, distress, pain and injury; and (4) justification for euthanasia method if not consistent with the avma guidelines for the euthanasia of animals. reviewers will assess the use of chimpanzees as they would any other application proposing the use of vertebrate animals. for additional information on review of the vertebrate animals section, please refer to the worksheet for review of the vertebrate animal section.biohazardsreviewers will assess whether materials or procedures proposed are potentially hazardous to research personnel and/or the environment, and if needed, determine whether adequate protection is proposed.resubmissionsfor resubmissions, the committee will evaluate the application as now presented, taking into consideration the responses to comments from the previous scientific review group and changes made to the project.renewalsnot
