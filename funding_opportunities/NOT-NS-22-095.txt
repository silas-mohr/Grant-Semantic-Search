thus, it is critical that models and outcome measures/endpoints represent causally relevant aspects of pain pathology and are well-validated in terms of their predictive relationship to clinical outcomes. this initiative encourages rigorous internal and external validation studies of models, outcome measures and endpoints. external validation refers to the demonstration that the model can recapitulate aspects of the disease phenotype and etiology (see par-21-123 for details regarding external validation, including face, construct, and predictive types of validity). validation may also include independent replication studies, ideally at multiple sites. validation studies that include independent replication would lend greater confidence in the model and/or endpoint(s) by the broader research community, and use of these well-validated models and endpoints in the evaluation of candidate therapeutics has the potential to increase reproducibility, ultimately de-risking translational projects.research objectivesthis nosi will support the development, validation, and independent replication of translationally relevant animal models, endpoints, and outcome measures for pain using par-21-123. applications to this nosi must address all requirements of par-21-123.validation studies are required under par-21-123. as part of the larger validation plan, projects may include independent replication studies, including replication studies carried out by partnering academic institutions, contract research organizations, and/or small business concerns. proposals focused solely on replication studies of preexisting models are allowed; applications may also expand variables as appropriate (e.g., testing across different ages, incorporating relevant comorbities, multiple endpoints, etc.).a current challenge in the field is that interventions showing efficacy in animal models of pain often fail to produce significant clinical outcomes in humans. therefore, applications are strongly encouraged to focus on models that reflect human pathological pain and promote a significant improvement in the translational relevance of animal models that will be utilized to facilitate future development of non-addictive analgesics.resources are available for applicants looking to maximize the impact of their heal-supported projects through broad data sharing. information on heal data stewardship can be found here: https://www.healdatafair.org/examples of applications or studies that are non-responsive to this nosi:interested investigators are strongly encouraged to contact scientific/research staff prior to submitting an application.application and submission informationthis notice applies to due dates on or after october 18, 2022 and subsequent receipt dates through june 25, 2025.submit applications for this initiative using one of the following funding opportunity announcements (foas) or any reissues of these announcement through the expiration date of this notice.all instructions in the sf424 (r&r) application guide and the funding opportunity announcement used for submission must be followed, with the following additions:applications nonresponsive to terms of this nosi will be withdrawn from consideration for this initiative.scientific/research contact(s)rebecca roof, phd national institute of neurological disorders and stroke (ninds) telephone: 301-496-1779 email: rebecca.roof@nih.govjulia l bachman, phd national institute of neurological disorders and stroke (ninds) email: julia.bachman@nih.govalex tuttle, phd national center for complimentary and integrative health (nccih) telephone: 301-814-6115 email: alex.tuttle@nih.govmark egli, phd national institute on alcohol abuse and alcoholism (niaaa) email: megli@willco.niaaa.nih.govmelissa ghim, phd national institute of dental & craniofacial research (nidcr) telephone: 301-529-6570 e-mail: melissa.ghim@nih.govrachel altshuler, ph.d. national cancer institute (nci) telephone: 240-276-5873 email: rachel.altshuler@nih.govdevon oskvig, ph.d. national institute on aging (nia) telephone: 301-496-9350 e-mail:devon.oskvig@nih.govhelena ahn, ph.d. eunice kennedy shriver national institute of child health and human development (nichd) telephone: 301-827-3207 email: helena.ahn@nih.govmarie mancini, ph.d. national institute of arthritis and musculoskeletal and skin diseases (niams) telephone: 301-594-5032 email: mancinim2@mail.nih.govpeer review contact(s)examine your era commons account for review assignment and contact information (information appears two weeks after the submission due date).financial/grants management contact(s)chief grants management officer national institute of neurological disorders and stroke (ninds) email: chiefgrantsmanagementofficer@ninds.nih.govweekly toc for this announcement nih funding opportunities and noticesnote: for help accessing pdf, rtf, ms word, excel, powerpoint, audio or video files, see help downloading files.
