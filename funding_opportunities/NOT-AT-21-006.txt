trial required)national center for complementary and integrative health (nccih)the purpose of this notice of special interest (nosi) is to describe nccih priorities in innovative basic and mechanistic research or technology/method development research relevant to complementary and integrative health approaches.complementary health approaches include a broad range of practices and interventions that are not typically part of conventional medical care. complementary approaches can be classified by their primary therapeutic input, which may be dietary (e.g., special diets, dietary supplements, herbs, probiotics, and microbial-based therapies), psychological (e.g., meditation, hypnosis, music-based interventions, relaxation therapies), physical (e.g., acupuncture, massage, chiropractic manipulation, devices related to these approaches), or a combination of psychological and physical (e.g., yoga, tai chi, dance therapies, some forms of art therapies). the dietary approaches include what have been previously categorized as natural products, whereas psychological and/or physical approaches encompass what have been commonly referred to as mind and body interventions. integrative health brings conventional and complementary approaches together in a coordinated way. integrative health also emphasizes multimodal interventions that aim to improve health in multiple interconnected domainsâ€”social, psychological, and physical, including multiple organs and systems.basic and mechanistic research on complementary and integrative health approaches should investigate the following key aspects. the first is the approach (also called intervention) itself, the second is the biological, behavioral, psychological, and/or social systems potentially targeted by the approach or intervention, and the third is the platform in which they will be studied (e.g., cell cultures, animal models, human subjects, or a computational model/in silico system). in the context of complementary and integrative health approaches, mechanistic research often refers to studies examining the interactions between the approach and the systems (e.g., biological, behavioral, psychological, and/or social), whereas basic research may investigate either the approach or intervention itself, the systems without the interactions, or the associated technologies. when basic research is pursued, applicants are encouraged to articulate the relevance of their basic or technological/method development research to a complementary or integrative health approach if the approach is not to be directly studied.although the areas of research submitted under this nosi can be very broad, the following topics are high program priorities for nccih:basic research (please specify the potential relevance of the proposed study to a complementary or integrative health approach if no interventions are to be studied directly.)research on mechanisms of complementary or integrative
