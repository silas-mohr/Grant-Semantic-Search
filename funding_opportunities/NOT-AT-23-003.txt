behavioral and social sciences research (obssr)the brain research through advancing innovative neurotechnologies (brain) initiative is aimed at revolutionizing neuroscience through development and application of innovative technologies to map neural circuits, monitor and modulate their activity, and understand how they contribute to thoughts, sensations, emotions, and behaviors. nih has issued a variety of funding opportunity announcements (foas) that will support projects that apply technologies to understand neural circuit function in the context of specific circuits, resulting in a diverse portfolio of research into the fundamental biology of nervous system function.the purpose of this announcement is to notify the research community that nih welcomes brain initiative applications targeting interoceptive processes and circuits, as appropriate to the goals and requirements of specific brain initiative foas. for this nosi, interoception includes the processes by which an organism senses, interprets, integrates, and regulates signals originating within itself and represents its internal states. interoception includes the processes by which an organism senses, interprets, integrates, and regulates internal signals. here, the action of “sensing” denotes communication from physiological systems outside of the central nervous system (cns) to the cns, through the commonly called ascending or afferent pathways, whereas the action of “regulating” refers to the communication from the brain to other physiological systems via descending or efferent pathways. the cns, especially the brain, is primarily responsible for interpreting and integrating these signals into a representation of the internal world as well as the generation of regulating signals. the systems involved in sensing signals about the internal environment include not only the peripheral nervous system and the cns but also components of the peripheral internal organs such as vascular, endocrine, and immune systems.although implicated in a variety of neurologic and psychiatric disorders, interoception is part of normal nervous system function and is therefore of interest to the brain initiative. it is expected that the unique opportunities of the brain initiative will enable production of detailed maps of dynamic interoceptive circuits, and the adoption of powerful new tools for monitoring and modulating interoception circuit activity, leading to significant advances in the understanding of sensory processing and interoception within the cns of animal models or appropriate human subjects. this nosi is focused on the basic and fundamental science of central nervous system circuits whereas the ‘promoting research on interoception and its impact on health and disease’ notice of special interest emphasizes the interests of the 7 participating nih institutes and centers (not-at-21-002).for a list of relevant brain initiative foas, see the table below. for
