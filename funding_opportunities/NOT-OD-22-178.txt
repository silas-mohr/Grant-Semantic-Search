i.e., grade a or b recommended screenings), community preventive services task force (cpstf), american academy of pediatrics (aap) bright futures guidelines, and the american college of obstetricians and gynecologists (acog) women’s preventive services initiative. notably, although the affordable care act has helped to reduce disparities in coverage and increased access to screenings in populations that experience health disparities, screening rates for certain services remain suboptimal among some racial and ethnic minority groups, rural residents, and persons of lower socioeconomic status. these disparities may be driven by the complex interplay between determinants or factors at different levels of the social ecological model of health (e.g., individual, relationship, community, and societal levels), necessitating a multilevel approach to improve screening uptake.the nih convened a “pathways to prevention (p2p) workshop: achieving health equity in preventive services” in 2019 to evaluate the evidence on disparities in the uptake of uspstf-recommended clinical preventive services, including screenings. the workshop concluded that enhanced delivery and uptake of proven effective screening interventions to communities disproportionately burdened by chronic diseases is a pressing need. the corresponding independent panel report and federal partners meeting report of this p2p workshop delineates recommendations for future research to improve the dissemination and implementation of effective screening preventive services.research objectives:this nosi encourages highly innovative translational research focused on the delivery of multilevel interventions to improve uptake of evidence-based screening services that promote health equity and that are recommended by expert committees (e.g., the uspstf, cpstf, aap, acog). multilevel interventions are one tool to reduce health disparities and promote health equity because they address the dynamic interplay of multiple levels of socioecological influence, including those at the individual, interpersonal, family, organizational, neighborhood, community, and societal levels. for the purpose of this nosi, a multilevel intervention addresses at least two levels of influence to improve screening uptake (see the nimhd minority health and health disparities research framework and the nia health disparities research framework for examples of health determinants at different levels of influence). multilevel interventions would include group- or cluster-randomized trials and stepped wedge group- or cluster-randomized trials (see the research methods resources website for more information). prospective applicants whose research interests relate to studies that seek to build the evidence base for screenings that have not received a definitive grade or recommendation from expert committees are directed to the companion nosi (not-od-22-179).at minimum, the proposed studies must:research within scope of this funding opportunity includes, but is not limited to:populations of particular interest within the above-described research scope include, but are not limited to:feasibility and pilot research studies are encouraged, as well as efficacy and effectiveness studies of new, adapted, or tailored interventions.researchers are highly encouraged to use the phenx toolkit to maximize comparisons across datasets or studies and facilitate data integration and collaboration.investigators should carefully review the specific research interests of nih ics that are participating in this nosi.ico specific application and submission information:nih ics have separately advanced funding opportunity announcements (foas) relevant to this nosi. these foas might be specific to each ic mission area. applicants must select the ic and associated foa to use for submission of an application in response to the nosi. the selection must align with the ic requirements listed in order to be considered responsive to that foa. non-responsive applications will be withdrawn from consideration for this initiative.national cancer institute (nci)the national cancer institute (nci) is interested in multilevel evidence-based cancer screening studies among all populations, and especially among diverse populations experiencing health disparities. nci is particularly interested in studies that address gaps in cancer screening identified by the president’s cancer panel. for this nosi, evidence-based cancer screenings are those with a or b recommendations from the united states preventive services task force (uspstf), including tests for breast, cervical, colorectal, and lung cancers; tests for conditions that increase cancer risk are also of interest. these risk-increasing conditions include brca-related genetic testing and hepatitis c screening. refer to the uspstf website for the most recent cancer screening a and b recommendations.multilevel interventions should focus on and measure outcomes at two or more levels of individuals (patients, clinicians, and care caregivers), teams, healthcare systems and organizations, and the community setting where the healthcare system is located. interventions that focus on screening as a process rather than a single encounter are encouraged.additional areas of interest include, but are not limited to, studies that propose to:national institute on aging (nia)the national institute on aging (nia) encourages experimental, observational, or interventional studies focused on screening adults in midlife and at older ages. interventions may be focused on individuals, dyads, families, communities, organizations, and/or systems. nia is interested in intervention research that aligns with the alzheimer's disease-related dementias (ad/adrd) research implementation milestones (https://www.nia.nih.gov/research/milestones).for clinical trial proposals, studies should use screening strategies that have evidence of efficacy and that the intervention can be delivered with fidelity. nia is especially interested in receiving applications that fall within stage v of the nih stage model for behavioral intervention development that focus on the mechanisms that promote the successful implementation of interventions, consistent with the nih science of behavior change emphasis on mechanisms of change. nia is also interested in preliminary (stage i, ii, and iii) behavioral intervention development for mid-life and older individuals that capitalizes on and integrates basic research to inform the development of efficacious interventions, in accordance with the nih stage model. information about the nih stage model and behavioral intervention development can be found at: https://www.nia.nih.gov/research/dbsr/stage-model-behavioral-intervention-development.areas of interest include, but are not limited to:new data collection, novel interventions, or secondary analysis of existing datasets, such as the health and retirement study or the midlife in the u.s. (midus) study, which contain rich data on adults targeted by this foa are encouraged. for a list of datasets sponsored by the nia, see: data-resources-behavioral-and-social-research-aging.national institute on alcohol abuse and alcoholism (niaaa)the united states preventive services task force (uspstf) recommends that primary care providers screen all adults and conduct brief counseling for those who misuse alcohol, as it found evidence in support of screening and brief intervention (sbi) delivered in primary care to adults. however, disparities in such screening have been found to exist, as black non-hispanic persons report significantly lower prevalence of screening than do white non-hispanic persons, and college graduates report significantly higher prevalence of screening than do those with a high school degree or less. moreover, while many validated instruments already exist for alcohol screening, research indicates that many providers who do report screening for alcohol misuse do not use screening tools that can detect the full spectrum of alcohol misuse—e.g., they may be asking about drinking but are not properly screening—or they do not engage in follow-up questions, or they are unfamiliar with typical “standard drink” equivalents in discussing drinking with patients. furthermore, screening for alcohol misuse is performed inconsistently by emergency department (ed) and primary care physicians. other populations that likely would benefit from enhanced screening strategies are pregnant women and those in elderly care. beyond the screening process itself, provision of brief advice about drinking and subsequent referral to specialty treatment have been found to be inconsistently provided by primary care, ed, and other providers.areas of interest include, but are not limited to:national institute of arthritis and musculoskeletal and skin diseases (niams)the united states preventive services task force (uspstf) recommends screening for osteoporosis with bone measurement testing to prevent osteoporotic fractures in women 65 years and older and in postmenopausal women younger than 65 years who are at increased risk of osteoporosis, as determined by a formal clinical risk assessment tool (see osteoporosis). the uspstf found adequate evidence that clinical risk assessment tools are moderately accurate in identifying risk of osteoporosis and osteoporotic fractures and the most commonly used test is central dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (dxa) of the hip and lumbar spine. in the context of this nosi, the national institute of arthritis and musculoskeletal and skin diseases (niams) encourages highly innovative translational research focused on the dissemination and implementation of research findings from clinical and translational studies that address screening recommendations for osteoporosis. studies seeking to improve the uptake of osteoporosis evidence-based screening services across the lifespan and in diverse populations including, but not limited to, those experiencing health disparities and those that have been underserved are also highly encouraged. applicants are encouraged to discuss potential applications with the appropriate niams program director.eunice kennedy shrivernational institute of child health and human development (nichd):nichd invites applications that respond to the priority areas articulated in the nichd strategic plan 2020. nichd supports research to understand human development, improve reproductive health, enhance the lives of children and adolescents, and optimize abilities for all. for this funding opportunity, nichd is interested in projects that aim to increase implementation and uptake of evidence-based screening among nichd priority populations, which include:nichd is particularly interested in projects that establish the effectiveness and scalability of screening shown to improve health outcomes in the foregoing populations and considers context, including the needs, motivations, sustainability, and barriers to participation in screening services. nichd encourages applications that consider context and the multiple levels of the socioecological model, including family and community. nichd’s strive initiative aims to improve equity, diversity, inclusion, and accessibility (edia) in all aspects of supported research, which includes encouragement to leverage unique insights from members of the populations of interest as research team members or in paid advisory roles.national institute on drug abuse (nida)the united states preventive services task force (uspstf) recommends screening adults 18 years or older for unhealthy drug use, including pregnant and postpartum women. the uspstf has concluded that the current evidence for screening adolescents for unhealthy drug use is insufficient to make a recommendation for screening in this population. there is a need for research to contribute to the evidence base on implementation, sustainability, and scaling of screening for substance misuse and substance use disorder, including illicit drug use, prescription drug and opioid misuse, and opioid use disorder in adults, including pregnant women, in primary care, other healthcare settings, and community settings and systems.areas of interest include, but are not limited to, research to:national institute on deafness and other communication disorders (nidcd)the national institute on deafness and other communication disorders (nidcd) welcomes applications focused on normal and disordered communication processes, including diseases or conditions affecting hearing, balance, taste, smell, voice, speech, and language. populations of interest include both pediatric and adult. for this initiative, applications focused on screening and early identification of differences and disorders related to nidcd mission areas are highly desirable. applicants are strongly encouraged to learn more about nidcd research areas at https://www.nidcd.nih.gov/research/extramural.ares of interest include, but are not limited to:national institute of dental and craniofacial research (nidcr)the dental office is a primary care setting that provides an opportunity for oral health practitioners to conduct preventive general and oral health services, such as evidence-based screenings. many adolescents and adults in the u.s. may have a dental visit in a given year, but not a routine medical visit, or they may not be aware of the need to be screened for certain conditions throughout the lifespan. evidence-based health screenings in dental offices provide opportunities to identify individuals with undiagnosed or progressing medical conditions, beyond those conditions specific to the head and neck region. several studies have demonstrated the feasibility of conducting evidence-based screenings in the dental setting for medical conditions, such as diabetes. additionally, previous research indicates acceptability of screening for medical conditions in a dental setting by both dental professionals and patients. similarly, many young children in the u.s. may have annual medical wellness visits, but do not receive routine dental care due to access to care and other issues. preventive oral health services delivered in medical offices may address oral health disparities and reduce dental caries, one of the most prevalent chronic conditions affecting children in the u.s.nidcr encourages multilevel interventions focused on implementing sustainable screening by oral health professionals in a dental setting and appropriate follow-up (treatment or referral) for medical conditions and risk behaviors that have received an evidence-based grade a or b by the u.s. preventive services task force (uspstf). examples of conditions suitable for screening include but are not limited to: tobacco use in children/adolescents or tobacco smoking cessation in adults; depression in children, adolescents, and adults; obesity in children and adolescents; prediabetes and type 2 diabetes; hypertension; and/or human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) infection. further, nidcr encourages multilevel interventions focused on implementing preventive oral health services in young children by medical professionals in a medical setting, such as fluoride varnish application and fluoride supplement prescriptions to prevent dental caries. the complete list of conditions with uspstf evidence grade a & b is updated periodically, and investigators are encouraged to review the most up-to-date listing. investigators may also consider interventions that are related to screening activities recommended in the american academy of pediatrics (aap) bright futures guidelines, or by the advisory committee on immunization practices (acip), and that are relevant to nidcr’s mission.study designs would include efficacy, effectiveness, dissemination or implementation studies that examine aspects of screening across the care continuum from risk assessment to detection, through initial referral, and seeking care with medical or dental providers. research proposals must include screening uptake as a primary outcome.areas of interest include, but are not limited to, interventions that:national institute on mental health (nimh)the national institute of mental health (nimh) is interested in research on multi-level implementation strategies to increase recommended screening for indicated mental health conditions or autism spectrum disorder (asd) as part of routine care. research is needed to test multilevel implementation strategies at the organizational, community, provider, and patient-levels to assess their impact on the adoption, scale-up and sustainment of research supported screening and related practices in relevant settings. examples may include universal evidence-based depression screening across all populations ages 12 and older, and especially among underserved populations impacted by mental health disparities, in healthcare systems (e.g., primary care, emergency departments, coordinated specialty care and integrated behavioral healthcare) as well as other settings (e.g., community, school, child welfare, juvenile justice). additional examples include screening for suicide risk among those patients 12 and above being treated for behavioral conditions, screening for asd in pediatric settings, etc. for this nosi, evidence-based screenings are those with an a or b recommendation from the united states preventive services task force (uspstf) or recommendations from other professional organizations (e.g., american academy of pediatrics) that use a credible approach to reviewing evidence and making screening recommendations.examples of research encouraged by the nosi include, but are not limited to, studies that focus on:for clinical trial research on the effectiveness of implementation strategies, nimh requires a study design using an experimental therapeutics approach, in which clinical trials test intervention effects on mental health outcomes as well as elucidate the intervention’s mechanism(s) of action. in the case of implementation studies, targets/mechanisms might involve change in organizational/system-level factors to improve the adoption and sustained implementation of screening, and the fidelity and equity with which screening and related services are implemented. see the support for clinical trials at nimh web page for additional information and contact nimh program staff in advance of applying for information about nimh clinical trials practices and priorities.in response to the clinical trial parent announcements (pa-20-183; pa-20-184; pa-20-194; pa-20-195; or pa-20-196), nimh only accepts mechanistic studies that meet nih's definition of a clinical trial. see the foas for further information.national institute on minority health and health disparities (nimhd)nimhd is interested in projects that address screening disparities for conditions that are more prevalent in populations experiencing health disparities. populations with health disparities include african americans/blacks, hispanics/latinos, american indians/alaska natives, asians, native hawaiians and pacific islanders, socioeconomically disadvantaged populations, underserved rural populations, and sexual and gender minorities. projects are encouraged that encompass multiple domains (e.g., biological, behavioral, socio-cultural, environmental, physical environment, healthcare system) and multiple levels (e.g., individual, interpersonal, community, societal) to improve screening behavior and effectiveness of current recommended screening practices in these populations (see the nimhd research framework, https://www.nimhd.nih.gov/about/overview/research-framework.html).examples of potential topic areas include, but are not limited to:national institute of neurological disorders and stroke (ninds)the ninds is interested in mission relevant applications. the ninds supports basic, clinical, translational, and implementation research focused on identifying, monitoring, and targeting biological, environmental, social, community, structural, and healthcare system factors that lead to or are associated with disparities (or inequities) in neurological diseases and care across the lifespan. some priority disease areas include stroke and other cerebrovascular diseases, alzheimer’s disease-related dementias (including frontotemporal neurodegeneration, lewy body dementias, vascular contributions to cognitive impairment and dementia and mixed etiology dementia), epilepsy, migraine, nervous system infections, spinal cord injury, headache, parkinson's disease, and other neurodegenerative disorders, brain trauma, neurodevelopmental disorders, and the neurological consequences of hiv/aids. applicants are encouraged to incorporate community engagement strategies into their study designs. a letter of intent and communication with ninds program staff prior to submission of an application is strongly encouraged.ninds will only accept applications in response to?pa-20-184?“research project grant (parent r01 basic experimental studies with humans required)” and pa-20-185?“nih research project grant (parent r01 clinical trial not allowed)” in response to this nosi.national institute of nursing research (ninr)the national institute of nursing research (ninr) supports research that advances the prevention, detection, and management of disease and disability for individuals and populations and informs practice and policy across clinical and community settings. drawing on nursing’s holistic, contextualized perspective, ninr funds observational, intervention, and implementation research that integrates factors at multiple levels, including social determinants of health, to identify their role in health, health improvement, and health equity across many settings, including homes, schools, workplaces, clinics, justice settings, and the community.office of disease prevention (odp)the odp is interested in research that tests multilevel interventions to improve the uptake of evidence-based screening services among (but not limited to) populations that experience health disparities and that address topics relevant to the mission and research priorities outlined in the odp strategic plan. studies that aim to understand and address barriers to screening are also encouraged. furthermore, the odp encourages applications that include projects seeking to develop and/or test preventive interventions. the odp offers co-funding support for research that has strong implications for disease and injury prevention, advances health equity, and that includes innovative and appropriate research design, measurement, and analysis methods. information on resources for designing studies using the best available methods is available at: https://researchmethodsresources.nih.gov/. odp does not award grants. please contact one of the ic program contacts listed for questions related to funding.office of dietary supplements
