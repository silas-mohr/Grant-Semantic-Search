(r21) is intended to support both basic and clinical research from scientists who are beginning to establish an independent research career. it cannot be used for thesis or dissertation research. the research must be focused on one or more of the areas within the biomedical and behavioral scientific mission of the nidcd: hearing, balance, smell, taste, voice, speech, or language. the nidcd ecr award r21 grant mechanism supports different types of projects including secondary analysis of existing data; small, self-contained research projects; development of research methodology; translational research; outcomes research; and development of new research technology. irrespective of the type of project, the intent of the nidcd ecr award r21 is for the program director(s)/principal investigator(s) (pd(s)/pi(s)) to obtain sufficient preliminary data for a subsequent r01 application.not applicable.february 26, 2021; june 24, 2021; october 28, 2021; february

critical that applicants follow the instructions in the research (r) instructions in the sf424 (r&r) application guide,except where instructed to do otherwise (in this foa or in a notice from nih guide for grants and contracts ).conformance to all requirements (both in the application guide and the foa) is required and strictly enforced. applicants must read and follow all application instructions in the application guide as well as any program-specific instructions noted in section iv. when the program-specific instructions deviate from those in the application guide, follow the program-specific instructions.applications that do not comply with these instructions may be delayed or not accepted for review.there are several options available to submit your application through grants.gov to nih and department of health and human services partners. you must use one of these submission options to access the application forms for this opportunity.the nidcd early career research (ecr) award is different from other nih r21 programs. it is restricted to clinical and basic scientists who are transitioning to, or are already in the early stages of, their independent research career. the research should be focused on one or more of the areas within the biomedical and behavioral scientific mission of the nidcd, specifically: hearing, balance, smell, taste, voice, speech, or language. the expected outcome from projects funded under this mechanism is the acquisition of necessary preliminary data for a subsequent research project grant (r01) applicationthe proposed project may or may not be hypothesis-driven since the goal is to collect the necessary preliminary data sufficient to apply for an r01 grant. the project may aid in the formulation of hypotheses and may be milestone-driven or descriptive in scope. given that the goal is to collect preliminary data, r21 projects may be less immediately impactful or significant compared to the typical r01. it is not an expectation that this r21 project will likely "move the field forward" at this stage.preliminary data are not required. however, the project should be supported by sufficient information to give confidence to the reviewers that the proposed work is feasible and that data derived from the project would likely be suitable as preliminary data for a subsequent r01 application. if preliminary data are available, it is recommended that these be included.the nidcd ecr award r21 may be used by beginning clinical scientists planning a future application for an nidcd k08 or k23 mentored research career development award to demonstrate the feasibility of the research project to be proposed in their k-award application. applicants that have already received a k award from nidcd may reduce their effort on the k-award to no less than 50% (6 person-months based on a 12 month calendar) during the last two years of the k-award in order to become pd/pi on the nidcd ecr award r21 (see nih policy http://grants1.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/not-od-08-065.html). the pd/pi’s total level of effort must remain at 75% (9 person-months based on a 12 month calendar) or more across the k-award and the r21 award. questions regarding eligibility should be addressed prior to beginning to prepare the application by contacting the training staff member listed in section vii. agency contacts.see section viii. other information for award authorities and regulations.grant: a support mechanism providing money, property, or both to an eligible entity to carry out an approved project or activity.the oer glossary and the sf424 (r&r) application guide provide details on these application types. only those application types listed here are allowed for this foa.the oer glossary and the sf424 (r&r) application guide provide details on these application types. only those application types listed here are allowed for this foa.need help determining whether you are doing a clinical trial?the number of awards is contingent upon nih appropriations and the submission of a sufficient number of meritorious applications.the combined budget for direct costs for the entire project period may not exceed $375,000. no more than $125,000 in direct costs may be requested in any single year.the scope of the proposed project should determine the project period. the maximum period of support is 3 years.nih grants policies as described in the nih grants policy statement will apply to the applications submitted and awards made from this foa.higher education institutionsthe following types of higher education institutions are always encouraged to apply for nih support as public or private institutions of higher education:nonprofits other than institutions of higher educationfor-profit organizationslocal governmentsfederal governmentsothernon-domestic (non-u.s.) entities (foreign institutions) are not eligible to apply.non-domestic (non-u.s.) components of u.s. organizations are not eligible to apply.foreign components, as defined in the nih grants policy statement, are allowed.applicant organizationsapplicant organizations must complete and maintain the following registrations as described in the sf 424 (r&r) application guide to be eligible to apply for or receive an award. all registrations must be completed prior to the application being submitted. registration can take 6 weeks or more, so applicants should begin the registration process as soon as possible. the nih policy on late submission of grant applications states that failure to complete registrations in advance of a due date is not a valid reason for a late submission.program directors/principal investigators (pd(s)/pi(s))all pd(s)/pi(s) must have an era commons account. pd(s)/pi(s) should work with their organizational officials to either create a new account or to affiliate their existing account with the applicant organization in era commons. if the pd/pi is also the organizational signing official, they must have two distinct era commons accounts, one for each role. obtaining an era commons account can take up to 2 weeks.any individual(s) with the skills, knowledge, and resources necessary to carry out the proposed research as the program director(s)/principal investigator(s) (pd(s)/pi(s)) is invited to work with his/her organization to develop an application for support. individuals from underrepresented racial and ethnic groups as well as individuals with disabilities are always encouraged to apply for nih support.for institutions/organizations proposing multiple pds/pis, visit the multiple program director/principal investigator policy and submission details in the senior/key person profile (expanded) component of the sf424 (r&r) application guide.the pd/pi must be a u.s. citizen, permanent resident or valid u.s. visa holder. the pd/pi must be no more than 7 years beyond the date that the first professional, advanced professional, or terminal academic degree was awarded, whichever is most recent. the 7 year eligibility period will be calculated based on the mm/dd/yyyy the degree was awarded. the last application due date, not the application submission date, that falls within the 7 year eligibility period will be the last date an application may be submitted. formal years of clinical training (internship, residency, and fellowship) are not counted as part of the 7 year limit. in addition, exemption of years for clinical training is not limited to physicians. for example, individuals with clinical training or clinical fellowship years in clinical molecular genetics, audiology, or speech-language pathology are also eligible for our exemption. under certain rare and compelling circumstances, nidcd will accept requests for an extension to the 7-year standard eligibility period for its nidcd ecr award (r21) program. for extensions please contact the program coordinator listed in section vii. agency contacts. the request for an extension must be made prior to the expiration of the standard 7 year eligibility period.a resubmission will be allowed even if the 7 year eligibility period has expired provided the resubmission application is received within 37 months from the original submission due date based on current nih guidelines (not-od-14-074). for further information please contact the nidcd ecr award (r21) program coordinator listed in section vii. agency contacts.the pd/pi may be an independent early stage investigator or a late-stage postdoctoral fellow still in his/her mentor's laboratory. however, if still a postdoctoral fellow, there should be a clear commitment to the provision of laboratory space and a clear indication that a transition away from the mentor is being initiated and that the research project will be transferable to another u.s. institution.questions regarding eligibility should be addressed prior to beginning to prepare the application by contacting the appropriate staff member listed in section vii. agency contacts.individuals who have served as pd/pi on any nih research grant (including an r01, r03, r15, r21, sbir/sttr, subprojects of program project or center grants) or any other federally-funded research grant (e.g., nsf, doe, va) are not eligible for the nidcd ecr award grant program. however, former recipients of federally-funded national research service award fellowships and traineeships (i.e. f- and t- series awards) or mentored career development awards (i.e. k awards) are eligible for the nidcd ecr award grant program. recipients of the k99/r00 award are not eligible to apply for the nidcd ecr award (r21).this foa does not require cost sharing as defined in the nih grants policy statement.applicant organizations may submit more than one application, provided that each application is scientifically distinct.the nih will not accept duplicate or highly overlapping applications under review at the same time. this means that the nih will not accept:only one nidcd ecr award (r21) application may be submitted by a pd/pi per due date. pd/pis who successfully obtained an nidcd small grant award are ineligible for an nidcd ecr award (r21).applicants may not submit an nidcd r01, r15 or r21 application for the same review cycle that the nidcd ecr award application is submitted. in such cases, the nidcd ecr award r21 application will be withdrawn.the application forms package specific to this opportunity must be accessed through assist, grants.gov workspace or an institutional system-to-system solution. links to apply using assist or grants.gov workspace are available in part 1 of this foa. see your administrative office for instructions if you plan to use an

be followed.those pd/(s)/pi(s) with formal years of clinical training who wish to have those years excluded from the 7 year limit of eligibility must document those years of clinical training in their biographical sketch. the mm/yyyy the terminal degree was awarded, specific dates of clinical training i.e. from mm/yyyy to mm/yyyy, as well as the title and location of the clinical training should be specified in the pd/pi's biographical sketch.inclusion of the mentor(s) as an investigator/collaborator on the ecr award (r21) application is strongly discouraged and does not support the notion that the pd/pi is moving towards independence.all instructions in the sf424 (r&r) application guide must be followed.modular budgetall instructions in the sf424 (r&r) application guide must be followed. the effort dedicated to the nidcd ecr award r21 project must be commensurate with the aims of the project. at a minimum, the pd/pi is expected to commit 25% effort (i.e. 3 person-months based on a 12 month calendar) to the project unless a compelling justification for less is provided in the budget justification section of the application. pd/pi effort may be as high as 100% (i.e. 12 person-months based on a 12 month calendar). effort dedicated to the project reflects time commitment and may be more than the grant-supported salary committed. for example, the pd/pi may have a 25% time effort with only 10% of the pd/pi salary derived from the nidcd ecr award r21 with the rest coming from other sources.all instructions in the sf424 (r&r) application guide must be followed.all instructions

are required to follow the instructions for post-submission materials, as described in the policy. any instructions provided here are in addition to the instructions in the policy.note: effective for due dates on or after january 25, 2023, the data sharing plan and genomic data sharing plan (gds) as part of the resource sharing plan will not be evaluated at time of review.only the review criteria described below will be considered in the review process. applications submitted to the nih in support of the nih mission are evaluated for scientific and technical merit through the nih peer review system.the nidcd ecr award r21 grant is a mechanism supporting investigation of novel scientific ideas or new model systems, tools, or technologies that have the potential for significant impact on biomedical or biobehavioral research. an r21 grant application need not have extensive background material or preliminary information. accordingly, reviewers will focus their evaluation on the conceptual framework, the level of innovation, and the potential to significantly advance our knowledge or understanding. appropriate justification for the proposed work can be provided through literature citations, data from other sources, or, when available, from investigator-generated data. preliminary data are not required for r21 applications; however, they may be included if available. an ecr award grant application will not have the same level of detail or extensive discussion found in an r01 application. the pd/pi should provide sufficient information to give confidence to the reviewers that the proposed work is feasible and that data derived from the project would likely be suitable as pilot data for a subsequent r01 application.it is not expected that at this stage these data will make a significant contribution to ‘drive’ or move the field forward. finally, the nidcd ecr award program is intended for investigators who are in the beginning stages of establishing an independent research career. these pd/pis are not expected to have the same grant writing experience as a more senior r01 funded investigator. nidcd ecr award projects may be less immediately impactful or significant compared to an r01.in addition, for applications involving clinical trials: a proposed clinical trial application may include study design, methods, and intervention that are not by themselves innovative but address important questions or unmet needs. additionally, the results of the clinical trial may indicate that further clinical development of the intervention is unwarranted or lead to new avenues of scientific investigationreviewers will provide an overall impact score to reflect their assessment of the likelihood for the project to exert a sustained, powerful influence on the research field(s) involved, in consideration of the following review criteria and additional review criteria (as applicable for the project proposed).reviewers will consider each of the review criteria below in the determination of scientific merit, and give a separate score for each. an application does not need to be strong in all categories to be judged likely to have major scientific impact. for example, a project that by its nature is not innovative may be essential to advance a field.significancedoes the project address an important problem or a critical barrier

investigators and staffing for a coordinating center?innovationdoes the application challenge and seek to shift current research or clinical practice paradigms by utilizing novel theoretical concepts, approaches or methodologies, instrumentation, or interventions? are the concepts, approaches or methodologies, instrumentation, or interventions novel to one field of research or novel in a broad sense? is a refinement, improvement, or new application of theoretical concepts, approaches or methodologies, instrumentation, or interventions proposed?in addition, for applications proposing clinical trialsdoes the design/research plan include innovative elements, as appropriate, that enhance its sensitivity, potential for information or potential to advance scientific knowledge or clinical practice?are the overall strategy, methodology, and analyses well-reasoned and appropriate to accomplish the specific aims of the project? have the investigators included plans to address weaknesses in the rigor of prior research that serves as the key support for the proposed project? have the investigators presented strategies to ensure a robust and unbiased approach, as appropriate for the work proposed? are potential problems, alternative strategies, and benchmarks for success presented? if the project is in the early stages of development, will the strategy establish feasibility and will particularly risky aspects be managed? have the investigators presented adequate plans to address relevant biological variables, such as sex, for studies in vertebrate animals or human subjects?in addition, for applications proposing clinical trials:does the application adequately address the following, if applicable:study designis the study design justified and appropriate to address primary and secondary outcome variable(s)/endpoints that will be clear, informative and relevant to the hypothesis being tested? is the scientific rationale/premise of the study based on
