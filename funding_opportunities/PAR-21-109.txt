questions in basic physiology, individual behavior, social and group processes, and developmental and aging processes. because of a shared evolutionary history, nhps can serve as valuable models of humans in physiology, immunology, neuroanatomy, reproduction, sensory and motor function, and cognitive and social complexity. to facilitate translation, nhps provide a critical step in therapeutic development and improve the chances of accurately predicting human responses to treatment.however, research with nhps presents challenges that do not exist with most other animal models. for example, due to their larger size, longer life span, and enhanced requirements for maintenance and care, work with nhps requires more elaborate management and higher expenses than for most other animal models. the high expense and specialized expertise required for nhp research can create a prohibitive barrier to entry for early stage investigators (esis) pursuing a career in promising nhp-based basic science or translational research. the purpose of this funding opportunity announcement is to provide tailored support for esis to initiate basic or translational research with nhps. these awards will allow esis additional funds, time to generate preliminary data, and the opportunity to establish all skills needed to set up and run an nhp laboratory independently. it is expected that these awards will thereby improve an esi’s ability to secure larger research awards (e.g., r01) and will facilitate their transition to independent tenure-track positions.research interests of participating institutes, centers and officesoffice of research infrastructure programs (orip)the office of research infrastructure programs (orip) in the office of the director (od) will support applications from esis using nhp models who are veterinarian scientists. veterinarian scientists are individuals with a dvm/vmd degree who are engaged in biomedical research.national institute on aging (nia)the national institute on aging (nia) will support applications from esis using nhp models to investigate aging processes and aging related diseases/conditions, and for research that aligns with the national institute on aging’s strategic directions for research, 2020-2025.national institute on alcohol abuse and alcoholism (niaaa)the national institute on alcohol abuse and alcoholism (niaaa) will support applications from esis using nhp models to conduct research within the mission of niaaa. the proposed studies need to be in compliance with the ethical guideline in using nhp models and to generate fundamental knowledge about consequences of alcohol misuse and alcohol use disorder (aud), and to advance treatments for aud and other alcohol-related diseases.national center for complementary and integrative health (nccih)the national center for complementary and integrative health (nccih) will support applications from esis using nhp models to study the mechanisms of action and preclinical assessments of complementary and integrative health approaches. such approaches may include natural products, such as botanicals, probiotics and microbials, dietary supplements, special medical diets, or their extracts or natural components, as well as mind and body approaches, including acupuncture, transcutaneous vagal stimulation, spinal manipulations, massage, mindful breathing or meditation, progressive relaxation, music-based interventions, olfaction-based interventions, light-based interventions, or other meditative movement therapies. studies in the context of well-being, health promotion and restoration, disease prevention, resilience, pain, sleep, and symptom management would be of interest. translational studies using similar intervention paradigms as those used in humans as well as assessing comparable mechanistic and pathophysiological outcomes are encouraged.see section viii. other information for award authorities and regulations.grant: a

innovation, and the potential to significantly advance our knowledge or understanding. appropriate justification for the proposed work can be provided through literature citations, data from other sources, or, when available, from investigator-generated data. preliminary data are not required for r21 applications; however, they may be included if available.this funding opportunity announcement focuses on the use of nhps as models to initiate/develop basic or translational research in the areas of interest of participating institutes.reviewers will provide an overall impact score to reflect their assessment of the likelihood for the project to exert a sustained, powerful influence on the research field(s) involved, in consideration of the following review criteria and additional review criteria (as applicable for the project proposed).reviewers will consider each of the review criteria below in the determination of scientific merit, and give a separate score for each. an application does not need to be strong in all categories to be judged likely to have major scientific impact. for example, a project that by its nature is not innovative may be essential to advance a field.significancedoes the project address an important problem or a critical barrier to progress in the field? is the prior research that serves as the key support for the proposed project rigorous? if the aims of the project are achieved, how will scientific knowledge, technical capability, and/or clinical practice be improved? how will successful completion of the aims change the concepts, methods, technologies, treatments, services, or preventative interventions that drive this field?is this project likely to lay the groundwork for basic science research or translational/clinical studies in humans?investigator(s)are the pd(s)/pi(s), collaborators, and other researchers well suited to the project? if early stage investigators or those in the early stages of independent careers, do they have appropriate experience and training? if established, have they demonstrated an ongoing record of accomplishments that have advanced their field(s)? if the project is collaborative or multi-pd/pi, do the investigators have complementary and integrated expertise; are their leadership approach, governance and organizational structure appropriate for the project?do the pd(s)/pi(s) and/or collaborators have experience performing basic science or translational research in nonhuman primates?innovationdoes the application challenge and seek to shift current research or clinical practice paradigms by utilizing novel theoretical concepts, approaches or methodologies, instrumentation, or interventions? are the concepts, approaches or methodologies, instrumentation, or interventions novel to one field of research or novel in a broad sense? is a refinement, improvement, or new application of theoretical concepts, approaches or methodologies, instrumentation, or interventions proposed?are the overall strategy, methodology, and analyses well-reasoned and appropriate to accomplish the specific aims of the project? have the investigators included plans to address weaknesses in the rigor of prior research that serves as the key support for the proposed project? have the investigators presented strategies to ensure a robust and unbiased approach, as appropriate for the work proposed? are potential problems, alternative strategies, and benchmarks for success presented? if the project is in the early stages of development, will the strategy establish feasibility and will particularly risky aspects be managed? have the investigators presented adequate plans to address relevant biological variables, such as sex, for studies in vertebrate animals or human subjects?does the research plan describe basic science or translational research in nonhuman primates with clear potential translation to humans?if the project involves human subjects and/or nih-defined clinical research, are the plans to address 1) the protection of human subjects from research risks, and 2) inclusion (or exclusion) of individuals on the basis of sex/gender, race, and ethnicity, as well as the inclusion or exclusion of individuals of all ages (including children and older adults), justified in terms of the scientific goals and research strategy proposed?environmentwill the scientific environment in which the work will be done contribute to the probability of success? are the institutional support, equipment and other physical resources available to the investigators adequate for the project proposed? will the project benefit from unique features of the scientific environment, subject populations, or collaborative arrangements?do the pd(s)/pi(s) and/or collaborators have appointments at a nonhuman primate facility which can provide nonhuman primates, core facilities, and intellectual resources for using nonhuman primates in basic science or translational research, such as a national primate research center or similar? if the pd(s)/pi(s) do not have an appointment at a nonhuman primate facility, is there documentation of a commitment from an appropriate nonhuman primate facility to host the research?as applicable for the project proposed, reviewers will evaluate the following additional items while determining scientific and technical merit, and in providing an overall impact score, but will not give separate scores for these items.protections for human subjectsfor research that involves human subjects but does not involve one of the categories of research that are exempt under 45 cfr part 46, the committee will evaluate the justification for involvement of human subjects and the proposed protections from research risk relating to their participation according to the following five review criteria: 1) risk to subjects, 2) adequacy of protection against risks, 3) potential benefits to the subjects and others, 4) importance of the knowledge to be gained, and 5) data and safety monitoring for clinical trials.for research that involves human subjects and meets the criteria for one or more of the
