programs in clinical and community settings. however, relatively little is spent on research to understand how best to ensure that the lessons learned from research are relevant to inform and improve the quality of health, delivery of services, and the utilization and sustainability of evidence-based interventions. for years, we have known of the limitations of research publications in leading to widespread uptake of evidence-based interventions, but too often the scientific pathway ends prematurely, before we can determine the best ways to improve equitable adoption, implementation, and sustainability. given the interest and investment in intervention trials that seek to determine the optimal interventions to be used in clinical and community settings, it is essential that practitioners (e.g., healthcare providers, public health practitioners), consumers, families, caregivers, communities (e.g., workplace, school, place of worship), healthcare practice settings, and policymakers are equipped with empirically-supported strategies to integrate scientific knowledge and effective health interventions into everyday use. the national institutes of health has recognized that closing the gap between biomedical or basic behavioral discovery, population health, and healthcare delivery and public health is both a complex challenge and an absolute necessity if we are to ensure that all populations benefit from the nation’s investments in scientific discoveries.for many years, health researchers may have assumed that evidence-based interventions would be readily adopted and implemented; however, compelling evidence suggests that this has not been the case. even when interventions have been tested within effectiveness studies, the development of knowledge to support their broader dissemination and implementation (e.g., cost and financing of the intervention, practitioner training, availability of resources, integration into community or healthcare systems, delivery to underserved or under-resourced populations, monitoring the quality or equity of intervention delivery) has often remained outside the scope of these large-scale clinical trials. this has also been the case for the dissemination and implementation of policies and guidelines.dissemination and implementation research intends to bridge the gap between research, practice, and policy by building a knowledge base about how health information, effective interventions, and new clinical practices, guidelines, and policies are communicated and integrated for public health and health care service use in specific settings.for the purpose of this foa, we make a distinction between "dissemination research" and "implementation research", as follows:dissemination research is defined as the scientific study of the targeted distribution of information and intervention materials to a specific public health, clinical practice, or policy audience. the intent is to understand how best to communicate and integrate knowledge and the associated evidence-based interventions.we are currently missing critical information about how, when, by whom, and under what circumstances evidence spreads throughout communities, organizations, front line workers and consumers of public health and clinical services. as a prerequisite for unpacking how information can lead to intervention or service changes, we need to understand how and why information on physical and behavioral health, preventive services, disease management, decision making, and other effective interventions may or may not reach stakeholders. we need to understand what underlies the creation, transmission, and reception of information on evidence-based pharmacological, behavioral, psychosocial, genomic, policy, and systems interventions. successful dissemination of evidence for effective health interventions may occur quite differently depending on whether the audience consists of consumers, caregivers, practitioners, policymakers, employers, administrators, or other stakeholder groups. moving the field forward will require studies identifying mechanisms and approaches to package and convey the evidence necessary to improve public health, community, and healthcare services in ways relevant to local settings.implementation research is defined as the scientific study of the use of strategies to adopt and integrate evidence-based health interventions into clinical and community settings to improve individual outcomes and benefit population health.implementation research seeks to understand the behavior of practitioners and support staff, organizations, consumers and family members, and policymakers in context as key influences on the adoption, implementation, and sustainability of evidence-based health interventions. implementation studies should not assume that effective interventions can be integrated into any service setting and for consumer groups and populations without attention to local context, nor that a unidirectional flow of information (e.g., publishing a recommendation, trial, or guideline) is sufficient to achieve practice change. relevant studies should develop a knowledge base about "how" evidence-based interventions are integrated within diverse practice settings and patient populations, which likely will require more than the distribution of information about the interventions. this research announcement encourages studies to test models, theories, and conceptual frameworks of the implementation process that move away from an exclusively "top-down" or reductionist approach to a greater emphasis on the resources of local care settings and the needs of multiple stakeholders, including approaches such as systems science, team science, community engaged research, participatory action research, citizen science, and related approaches that engage stakeholders and end-users throughout the research process.dissemination and implementation (d&i) research: broadly, studies in this field typically involve both interdisciplinary cooperation and transdisciplinary collaboration, utilizing theories, empirical findings, and methods from a variety of scientific disciplines. relevant fields include but are not limited to: information science, organizational and management theory, health economics, behavioral science, public health, business and public administration, statistics, anthropology, epidemiology, decision science, engagement science, systems science, health equity research, engineering, and marketing. d&i research will often include significant and ongoing collaboration with stakeholders from multiple public health and/or clinical practice settings as well as consumers of services and their families/social networks. this foa will support a variety of rigorous study designs including (but not limited to) observational, experimental, quasi-experimental, and simulation modeling that produce evidence on relevant outcomes (e.g., acceptability, feasibility, adoption, fidelity, penetration, sustainability), costs, and/or unanticipated consequences of dissemination and implementation efforts. the goal is to conduct dissemination and implementation studies utilizing research designs that are rigorous and measures that are relevant to stakeholders. wherever possible, studies of dissemination or implementation strategies should build knowledge both on the overall effectiveness of the strategies, as well as "how and why" they work. data on mechanisms of action, moderators and mediators, and costs of dissemination and implementation strategies will greatly aid decision-making on which strategies work for which interventions, in which settings, and for what populations.for additional resources on dissemination and implementation research, including information on d&i training opportunities, funded studies, key references, past workshops and conferences,

determinants of health or social needs in developing and testing strategies to advance adoption, adaptation, fidelity, acceptability, cost, and sustainability of evidence-based interventions in cancer prevention and control. implementation research aims should be guided by equity-oriented theoretical models and frameworks and the equity related outcomes or approaches clearly described. multilevel approaches and transdisciplinary and intersectoral collaborations (e.g., transportation, housing, food systems) are encouraged. to the extent possible, studies may include an evaluation to assess that implementation projects are not inadvertently exacerbating health disparities or inequalities. research that engages public health practitioners in community settings (e.g., health departments, coalitions, community organizations) as well as practice-based research are encouraged.in efforts to advance the field, nci launched the consortium for cancer implementation science (ccis) which broadly focuses on cancer control priorities, cross-collaborations across disciplines and institutions, and innovative solutions to advance measures and methods in implementation science. applications
