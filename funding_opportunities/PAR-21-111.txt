iii. eligibility information section iv. application and submission information section v. application review information section vi. award administration information section vii. agency contacts section viii. other informationthe overall goal of the nih research career development program is to help ensure that a diverse pool of highly trained scientists is available in appropriate scientific disciplines to address the nation's biomedical, behavioral, and clinical research needs. nih institutes and centers (ics) support a variety of mentored and non-mentored career development award programs designed to foster the transition of new investigators to research independence and to support established investigators in achieving specific objectives. candidates should review the different career development (k) award programs to determine the best program to support their goals. more information about career programs may be found at the nih extramural training mechanisms website.doctoral-level investigators pursuing careers in all fields of cancer research often require extended periods of mentored research training beyond their original doctoral degrees (e.g., m.d., m.d./ph.d., or ph.d.). these investigators perform their research training at domestic extramural institutions/organizations, as well as in federal research groups. many of these investigators need additional protected time to develop successful independent research programs.the objective of the nci transition career development award (k22) is to provide support to mentored, non-independent investigators in transitioning to their first independent tenure-track faculty cancer research positions, or their equivalent, with an enhanced probability of success for obtaining independent nih or other research project grant support. candidates in mentored, non-independent cancer research positions who have had at least 2 years of postdoctoral cancer research training, but, no more than a total of 8 years of mentored, non-independent training experience after the terminal research doctorate or clinical degree may apply, and if successful, must obtain tenure-track faculty, or equivalent, positions, and nci approval before awards will be issued.the nci k22 award will provide up to 3 years of support for the most promising and exceptionally talented mentored, non-independent investigators. this period of support is to allow the investigator to work towards establishing his/her own independent cancer research program and to prepare an application for cancer research grant support (r01 or equivalent). nci believes that the creativity and innovation of new independent cancer research investigators in their early career stages play an integral role in addressing our nation’s biomedical, behavioral, and clinical cancer research needs.the candidate submits a k22 application from the institution where he/she currently pursues mentored, non-independent research training. the application will be peer reviewed and assigned an overall impact score. successful candidates (i.e. whose application has been selected for funding) will receive a letter of intent to commit funds from nci that will include the terms and conditions to issue/activate the k22 award. in order to issue/activate the k22 award, the candidate will need to first secure a tenure-track faculty position, in an extramural institution that is not an agency of the federal government, within 12 months of the receipt of the letter of intent to commit funds. once the faculty position has been secured, the candidate will submit updated information about the k22 application with the support of the awardee institution. the updated information about the transition to a tenure-track faculty position at the awardee institution will be evaluated by nci staff to ensure that all programmatic requirements are met prior to the issuance/activation of the k22 award. the details of the requirements for the issuance/activation of the k22 award are described in section vi.note: this funding opportunity announcement (foa) is designed specifically for candidates proposing research that involves leading an independent clinical trial, a clinical trial feasibility study, or an ancillary study to a clinical trial. those not proposing a clinical trial, a clinical trial feasibility study, or an ancillary study to an ongoing clinical trial as lead investigator, should apply to the companion foa (par-21-128).nih defines a clinical trial as "a research study in which one or more human subjects are prospectively assigned to one or more interventions (which may include placebo or other control) to evaluate the effects of those interventions on health-related biomedical or behavioral outcomes." (not-od-15-015).for foas that require independent clinical trials, as this foa does, complete section 4 – protocol synopsis information and section 5 - other clinical trial-related attachments.non-responsive applicationsapplications with one or more of the characteristics listed below will be considered non-responsive and will not be reviewed:see section viii. other information for award authorities and regulations.grant: a support mechanism providing money, property, or both to an eligible entity to carry out an approved project or activity.new resubmissionthe oer glossary and the sf424 (r&r) application guide provide details on these application types. only those application types listed here are allowed for this foa.required: only accepting applications that propose an independent clinical trial(s)need help determining whether you are doing a clinical trial?the number of awards is contingent upon nih appropriations and the submission of a sufficient number of meritorious applications.award budgets are composed of salary and other program-related expenses, as described below.the total project period may not exceed 3 years.nci will contribute up to $100,000 per year toward the salary of the career award recipient. further guidance on budgeting for career development salaries is provided in the sf424 (r&r) application guide.nci will contribute $50,000 per year toward the research development costs of the award recipient, which must be justified and consistent with the stage of development of the candidate and the proportion of time to be spent in research or career development activities. these funds may be used for the following expenses: (a) tuition and fees related to career development; (b) research-related expenses, such as supplies, equipment and technical personnel; c) travel to research meetings or training; and (d) statistical services including personnel and computer time.salary for secretarial and administrative assistants, etc. is not allowed.indirect costs (also known as facilities & administrative [f&a] costs) are reimbursed at 8% of modified total direct costs.nih grant policies as described in the nih grants policy statement will apply to the applications submitted and awards made from this foa.higher education institutionsthe following types of higher education institutions are always encouraged to apply for nih support as public or private institutions of higher education:nonprofits other than institutions of higher educationfor-profit organizationsgovernmentsotherthe applicant institution may be private (profit or nonprofit) or public. nih intramural and other eligible federal laboratories are eligible to submit k22 applications. however, nih intramural laboratories and other agencies of the federal government are not eligible to be the awardee institution.non-domestic (non-u.s.) entities (foreign institutions) are not eligible to apply. non-domestic (non-u.s.) components of u.s. organizations are not eligible to apply. foreign components, as defined in the nih grants policy statement, are allowed.applicant organizationsapplicant organizations must complete and maintain the following registrations as described in the sf 424 (r&r) application guide to be eligible to apply for or receive an award. all registrations must be completed prior to the application being submitted. registration can take 6 weeks or more, so applicants should begin the registration process as soon as possible. the nih policy on late submission of grant applications states that failure to complete registrations in advance of a due date is not a valid reason for a late submission.program directors/principal investigators (pd(s)/pi(s))all pd(s)/pi(s) must have an era commons account. pd(s)/pi(s) should work with their organizational officials to either create a new account or to affiliate their existing account with the applicant organization in era commons. if the pd/pi is also the organizational signing official, they must have two distinct era commons accounts, one for each role. obtaining an era commons account can take up to 2 weeks.all pd(s)/pi(s) must be registered with orcid. the personal profile associated with the pd(s)/pi(s) era commons account must be linked to a valid orcid id. for more information on linking an orcid id to an era commons personal profile see the orcid topic in our era commons online help.any candidate with the skills, knowledge, and resources necessary to carry out the proposed research as the program director/principal investigator (pd/pi) and who has at least 2 years of postdoctoral cancer research training, but, no more than a total of 8 years of mentored, non-independent training experience after the terminal research doctorate or clinical degree is invited to work with his/her organization to develop an application for support. parental, medical, or other well-justified leave for personal or family situations of generally less than 12 months duration is not included in the 8-year eligibility limit, nor is clinical training with no research involvement (e.g., full-time residency training). part-time postdoctoral research training, related to personal or family situations or occurring during a research residency or fellowship, will be pro-rated accordingly.individuals from diverse backgrounds, including those from underrepresented racial and ethnic groups, individuals with disabilities, and those from disadvantaged backgrounds are always encouraged to apply for nih support. such individuals may also be eligible for the nci transition career development award to promote diversity (k22) and are advised to contact the nci center to reduce cancer health disparities.multiple pds/pis are not allowed.by the time of award, the pd/pi of a k22 award must be a citizen or a non-citizen national of the united states or have been lawfully admitted for permanent residence (i.e., possess a currently valid permanent resident card uscis form i-551, or other legal verification of such status).postdoctoral investigators:at the time of the initial application submission (or resubmission), candidates for this award must (1) have earned a terminal clinical degree or research doctorate (including ph.d., m.d., d.o., d.c., n.d., d.ds., d.m.d., d.v.m.., sc.d., d.n.s., pharm.d., or equivalent doctoral degree) or a combined research doctorate/clinical degree; (2) have at least 2 years of postdoctoral, or its equivalent, training in cancer research (e.g., postdoctoral fellow, postdoctoral associate, clinical fellow, clinical associate, or equivalent); (3) have no more than a total of 8 years of mentored, non-independent research training experience after the terminal clinical degree or research doctorate; (4) have not already obtained an individual career development award or research project grant (except r03) from the federal government; and (5) have not already had or have a tenure-track faculty position, or its equivalent.individuals are eligible for a k22 award if they have been, or currently are, the pd/pi of an nih r03 or a phs or non-federal award that does not duplicate the specific aims or research goals of an r03 grant.other candidates:some institutions appoint postdoctoral fellows in positions with other titles (e.g., research associate, instructor, or equivalent), although they are still in mentored, non-independent training positions. candidates in such positions are encouraged to obtain confirmation of their eligibility from the nci k22 scientific/research contact listed in section vii before they begin to prepare their applications. it is incumbent upon the candidate to provide evidence that he/she is in a mentored, non-independent position if requested.investigators trained in mathematics, physical sciences and/or engineering may want to consider re-orienting to cancer-focused research careers. such investigators should have some prior training in cancer research, but, less than 2 years of postdoctoral cancer research training to be competitive for this non-mentored award. candidates in such positions are encouraged to obtain confirmation of their eligibility from the nci k22 scientific/research contact listed in section vii before they begin to prepare their applications.clinicians:time spent in clinical training is not counted for the 8-year postdoctoral research experience limit. following clinical training or fellowship training periods, clinicians (including those with m.d., d.d.s., d.v.m. degrees and other licensed professionals) may obtain clinical faculty positions that denote independence in clinical responsibilities, but not in research. a clinical faculty member who does not hold an independent research faculty position may be eligible for the k22 award and should contact the nci scientific/research contact listed in section vii for guidance. clinicians in such positions are encouraged to obtain confirmation of their eligibility before they begin to prepare their applications. such individuals may also wish to consider other career development awards available for physician scientists as well.nih intramural candidates:mentored, non-independent investigators in nih intramural laboratories and other eligible agencies of the federal government are eligible to apply for the nci k22 award.individuals are not eligible for the k22 award if they:the following is provided as an aid to distinguish independent from non-independent positions. however, it is not sufficient merely to cite one or more of the following items to document eligibility.evidence for non-independence may include:conversely, evidence for independence, and therefore lack of eligibility, includes:this foa does not require cost sharing as defined in the nih grants policy statement.applicant organizations may submit more than one application, provided that each application is scientifically distinct, and each is from a different candidate.the nih will not accept duplicate or highly overlapping applications under review at the same time. an individual may not have two or more competing nih career development applications pending review concurrently. in addition, nih will not accept:at the time of award, the candidate must have a “full-time” appointment at the applicant institution. candidates are required to commit a minimum of nine person months of effort (i.e., 75% of full-time professional effort) to their program of career development. candidates may engage in other duties as part of the professional effort not covered by this award, as long as such duties do not interfere with or detract from the proposed career development program.candidates who have va appointments may not consider part of the va effort toward satisfying the full time requirement at the applicant institution. candidates with va appointments should contact the staff person in the relevant institute or center prior to preparing an application to discuss their eligibility.after the receipt of the award, adjustments to the required level of effort may be made in certain circumstances. see not-od-09-036 for more details.nci k22 award recipients are expected to apply for nih or other independent research project grant support (r01 or equivalent) prior to the end of the 2nd year of support. recipients may hold concurrent research support, and, under certain circumstances, salary support from the final 2 years of their k22 award and a competing nih research project grant when recognized as the pd(s)/pi(s) or subproject director of the research project grant. see not-od-08-065.institutional environmentthe applicant institution must have a strong, well-established

mission are evaluated for scientific and technical merit through the nih peer review system.for this particular announcement, note the following: reviewers should evaluate the candidate’s potential for developing an independent research program that will make important contributions to the field, taking into consideration the years of research experience and the likely value of the proposed research career development as a vehicle for developing a successful, independent research program.reviewers should provide their assessment of the likelihood that the proposed career development and research plan will enhance the candidate’s potential for a productive, independent scientific research career in a health-related field, taking into consideration the criteria below in determining the overall impact score.reviewers will consider each of the review criteria below in the determination of scientific merit, and give a separate score for each. an application does not need to be strong in all categories to be judged likely to have major scientific impact.the reviewers will consider that the clinical trial may include study design, methods, and intervention that are not by themselves innovative, but address important questions or unmet needs. reviewers should also consider the scope of the clinical trial relative to the available resources, including the possibility that research support provided through career development awards may be sufficient to support only small feasibility studies.candidatecareer development plan/career goals and objectivesresearch planmentor, co-mentor, consultant(s), collaborator(s)environment & institutional commitment to the candidateas applicable for the project proposed, reviewers will evaluate the following additional items while determining scientific and technical merit, and in providing an overall impact score, but will not give separate scores for these items.is the study timeline described in detail, taking into account start-up activities, the anticipated rate of enrollment, and planned follow-up assessment? is the projected timeline feasible and well justified? does the project incorporate efficiencies and utilize existing resources (e.g., ctsas, practice-based research networks, electronic medical records, administrative databases, or patient registries) to increase the efficiency of participant enrollment and data collection, as appropriate?are potential challenges and corresponding solutions discussed (e.g., strategies that can be implemented in the event of enrollment shortfalls)?for research that involves human subjects but does not involve one of the categories of research that are exempt under 45 cfr part 46, the committee will evaluate the justification for involvement of human subjects and the proposed protections from research risk relating to their participation according to the following five review criteria: (1) risk to subjects, (2) adequacy of protection against risks, (3) potential benefits to the subjects and others, (4) importance of the knowledge to be gained, and (5) data and safety monitoring for clinical trials.for research that involves human subjects and meets the criteria for one or more of the categories of research that are exempt under 45 cfr part 46, the committee will evaluate: (1) the justification for the exemption, (2) human subjects involvement and characteristics, and (3) sources of materials. for additional information on review of the human subjects section, please refer to the guidelines for the review of human subjects.when the proposed project involves human subjects and/or nih-defined clinical research, the committee will evaluate the proposed plans for the inclusion (or exclusion) of individuals on the basis of sex/gender, race, and ethnicity, as well as the inclusion (or exclusion) of individuals across the lifespan (including children and older adults) to determine if it is justified in terms of the scientific goals and research strategy proposed. for additional information on review of the inclusion section, please refer to the guidelines for the review of inclusion in clinical research.the committee will evaluate the involvement of live vertebrate animals as part of the scientific assessment according to the following criteria: (1) description of proposed procedures involving animals, including species, strains, ages, sex, and total number to be used; (2) justifications for the use of animals versus alternative models and for the appropriateness of the species proposed; (3) interventions to minimize discomfort, distress, pain and injury; and (4) justification for euthanasia method if not consistent with the avma guidelines for the euthanasia of animals. reviewers will assess the use of chimpanzees as they would any other application proposing the use of vertebrate animals. for additional information on review of the vertebrate animals section, please refer to the worksheet for review of the vertebrate animal section.reviewers will assess whether materials or procedures proposed are potentially hazardous to research personnel and/or the environment, and if needed, determine whether adequate protection is proposed.for resubmissions, the committee will evaluate the application as now presented, taking into consideration the responses to comments from the previous scientific review group and changes made to the project.not applicablenot applicablenote: effective for due dates on or after january 25, 2023, the data sharing plan and genomic data sharing plan (gds) as part of the resource sharing plan will not be evaluated at time of review.as applicable for the project proposed, reviewers will consider each of the following items, but will not give scores for these items, and should not consider them in providing an overall impact score.all applications for support under this foa must include a plan to fulfill nih requirements for instruction in the responsible conduct of research (rcr). taking into account the level of experience of the candidate, including any prior instruction or participation in rcr as appropriate for the candidate’s career stage, the reviewers will evaluate the adequacy of the proposed rcr training in relation to the following five required components: 1) format - the required format of instruction, i.e., face-to-face lectures, coursework, and/or real-time discussion groups (a plan with only on-line instruction is not acceptable); 2) subject matter - the breadth of subject matter, e.g., conflict of interest, authorship, data management, human subjects and animal use, laboratory safety, research misconduct, research ethics; 3) faculty participation - the role of the mentor(s) and other faculty involvement in the fellow’s instruction; 4) duration of instruction - the number of contact hours of instruction (at least eight contact hours are required); and 5) frequency of instruction –instruction must occur during each career stage and at least once every four years. plans and past record will be rated as acceptable or unacceptable, and the summary statement will provide the consensus of the review committee. see also: not-od-10-019.reviewers will assess the information provided in this section of the application, including (1) the select agent(s) to be used in the proposed research, (2) the
