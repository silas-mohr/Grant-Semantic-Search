may 27, 2022pa-20-185 - nih research project grant (parent r01 clinical trial not allowed)not-hl-22-006 - notice of special interest (nosi): diagnostics and disease management tools for use in underserved populations - rescindnational heart, lung, and blood institute (nhlbi)purposethe purpose of this nosi is to stimulate research focused on the development of transformative diagnostics and disease management tools for heart, lung, blood, or sleep (hlbs) disorders that are designed to meet the needs of the underserved populations. underserved populations, for the purpose of this nosi, can include racial and ethnic minorities, immigrants, the homeless, low-income individuals, the uninsured and people who live in communities that are socioeconomically disadvantaged, rural or have few health care resources. please see not-od-20-031 for nih definitions. special consideration will be given to technology solutions that are accessible and feasible in these communities. working with community partners is required throughout the project to ensure successful development and implementation.backgroundhealth inequities and disparities are especially devastating in underserved populations. people in these communities often face a complex set of challenges related to health and health care delivery. not only can they face cultural, linguistic and financial barriers, but they also can be at higher risk for disease, face poorer health outcomes and have limited access to health care services. for instance, the centers for disease control and prevention (cdc) reports that african americans ages 18-49 are 2 times as likely to die from heart disease and those ages 35-64 years are 50 percent more likely to have high blood pressure compared to their white counterparts. as highlighted in the recent nhlbi workshop, “diagnostics and disease management tools for use in underserved populations”, partnerships with the community can drive and accelerate innovation to implementation and are key to impacting health in underserved populations. developing sustainable partnerships requires in-person engagement and takes investments of time, effort, and resources to build trust, understand needs, and develop meaningful relationships.research objectives and examplesthe nhlbi seeks r01 applications for diagnostics and disease management tools that have the power to deliver breakthroughs to enable prevention and treatment of heart, lung, blood and sleep diseases in underserved communities. investigators will be required to engage community partners at the onset and throughout their research project. it is critical to engage community partners early on, that can successfully advise and provide feedback to device and tool developers. this type of involvement includes advice from the community, participation in research, and shared leadership.some examples of tools to diagnose and manage heart, lung, blood, and sleep disorders that may be supported include (but are not limited to) the following:this notice applies to due dates on or after february 5, 2022 and subsequent receipt dates through july 6, 2025.submit applications to address this nosi by using one of the following funding opportunity announcements (foas) or any reissues of these announcements through the expiration date of this notice.all instructions in the sf424 (r&r) application guide and the funding opportunity announcement used for submission must be followed, with the following additions:applications nonresponsive to terms of this nosi will not be considered.applications nonresponsive to terms of this nosi will not be considered for the nosi initiative.scientific/research contact(s)national heart, lung, and blood institute (nhlbi)division of cardiovascular sciencesbishow adhikari, ph.d.phone: 301-594-2791email: adhikarb@nhlbi.nih.goverin iturriaga, d.n.p., m.s.n., r.n.phone: 301-435-0550email: erin.iturriaga@nih.govnational center on sleep disorders research, division of lung diseasesalfonso alfini, ph.d.phone: 301-827-8989email: alfonso.alfini@nih.govmarishka k. brown, ph.d.phone: 301-435-0199email: marishka.brown@nih.govcenter for translation research and implementation sciencepaul cotton, ph.d., rdnphone: 301-827-2806email: paul.cotton@nih.govdivision of blood diseases and resourceskyung moon, ph.d.phone: 301-402-4021email: kyung.moon@nih.govmargaret ochocinska, ph.d.phone: 301-827-8285email: ochocinm@mail.nih.govasif rizwan, ph.d.phone: 301-435-0070email: asif.rizwan@nih.govdivision of extramural research activitieskathleen rousche, ph.d.phone: 301-827-7981email: kathleen.rousche@nih.govdivision of lung diseaseslouis vuga, m.d., m.p.h., ph.d.phone: 301-435-0233email: louis.vuga@nih.govpeer review contact(s)examine your era commons account for review assignment and contact information (information appears two weeks after the submission due date).financial/grants management contactnhlbi office of grants managementanthony agrestiphone: 301-827-8014email: agrestia@nhlbi.nih.govweekly toc for this announcement nih funding opportunities and noticesnote: for help accessing pdf, rtf, ms word, excel, powerpoint, audio or video files, see help downloading files.
