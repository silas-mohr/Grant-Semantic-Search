january 26, 2021pa-20-185 - nih research project grant (parent r01 clinical trial not allowed)pa-20-195 - nih exploratory/developmental research grant program (parent r21 clinical trial not allowed)national institute of dental and craniofacial research (nidcr)purposethe national institute of dental and craniofacial research (nidcr) is issuing this notice of special interest (nosi) to encourage research studies focused on the physiological involvement of oral cavity and oral manifestations related to sars-cov-2 and/or coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19).globally, the death toll for covid-19 caused by the coronavirus sars-cov-2 has surpassed 1.9 million, and in the united states, more than 375,000 individuals have succumbed to the disease as of january 2021. synergizing with a myriad of initiatives across nih and responding to a palpable sense of public health urgency, nidcr is positioned to address covid-19 research knowledge gaps unique to our mission, as well as to facilitate broad and rapid dissemination of research findings. outcomes from this nosi are expected to strengthen the knowledge base of covid-19 disease mechanisms and presentations in the oral cavity.research objectivesthe oral/nasal route serves as the sars-cov-2 point of entry into the host thus playing a pivotal role in viral spread and covid-19 onset and progression. as such, limiting viral infectivity, replication, shedding, and load at the point of entry is crucial to containing covid-19 progression, as well as transmission to others. this nosi will support studies focused on the role of oral/nasal cavity and oral manifestations related to sars-cov-2 and/or covid-19 within the nidcr mission. the areas of interest include:projects that overlap with or will result in incremental knowledge gained from existing investments in covid-19 research by nidcr or nih initiatives such as the rapid acceleration of diagnostics (radx), are discouraged. clinical observations and other descriptive studies without mechanistic analyses will be considered non-responsive.potential applicants are strongly encouraged to contact the program official to discuss responsiveness and appropriate mechanism before submission.application and submission informationthis notice applies to due dates on or after june 5, 2021 and subsequent receipt dates through may 8, 2023.submit applications for this initiative using one of the following funding opportunity announcements (foas) or any reissues of these announcement through the expiration date of this notice.all instructions in the sf424 (r&r) application guide and the funding opportunity announcement used for submission must be followed, with the following additions:applications nonresponsive to terms of this nosi will not be considered for the nosi initiative.scientific/research contact(s)amanda melillo, ph.d. national institute of dental and craniofacial research (nidcr) telephone: 301-529-7217 email: amanda.melillo@nih.govpeer review contact(s)examine your era commons account for review assignment and contact information (information appears two weeks after the submission due date).financial/grants management contact(sdiana rutberg, mbanational institute of dental and craniofacial research (nidcr)telephone: 301-594-4798email: rutbergd@mail.nih.govweekly toc for this announcement nih funding opportunities and noticesnote: for help accessing pdf, rtf, ms word, excel, powerpoint, audio or video files, see help downloading files.
