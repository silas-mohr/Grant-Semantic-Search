institute of mental health (nimh)purposethe national institute of mental health is issuing this notice to highlight interest in receiving grant applications developmentally on tailored research focused on adolescents and emerging adults as it relates to hiv prevention and treatment.there are approximately 1.8 billion adolescents and emerging adults (youth; 10 to 24 years old) in the world, a number that is greater than at any other time in history. the developmental periods of adolescence and emerging adulthood are characterized by the acquisition of essential life skills, increased experimentation and risk taking. globally, youth are some of the most vulnerable to acquiring hiv. they also are the most likely to have poor health outcomes along the hiv care continuum.while the nih has a strong history of supporting research on youth and hiv, greater effort is needed to focus on the unique developmental processes during these time periods. it is well known that adolescence and emerging adulthood are characterized by enormous changes in biological, social, psychological, neurodevelopmental, hormonal, and immune functioning. our understanding of these time periods is continuing to grow. therefore, this notice encourages applications that incorporate recent research advances in adolescent and emerging adulthood development to optimize outcomes in hiv prevention and care research.our understanding of adolescence and emerging adulthood has increased dramatically over the past 15 years. while it was previously believed that brain development was relatively complete prior to adolescence, recent research has demonstrated that adolescence is a time of increased neuroplasticity, which has important implications for development. research has also shown that this is a time of heightened responsiveness to rewards or incentives and to socioemotional contexts, which has implications for decision making around sexual behavior and health care. in addition, adolescence is a time when impulse control and emotional regulation are still relatively immature. because of the rapid neurodevelopment that occurs during adolescence, the neural impact of inflammation from the persistent exposure to hiv in the cns could have a more substantial impact on brain development during this time. neuroendocrine and immune changes are also rapidly occurring during adolescence and emerging adulthood. these biological changes are occurring at the same time as changes to youths’ social context, defined by increasing time spent with peers, increasing salience of peer relationships, increasing amounts of time spent using technology and being on social media, and initiation of romantic/sexual relationships. gender and sexual orientation identity development are also key developmental processes that occur during adolescence and emerging adulthood. internalized stigma and gender dysphoria may play a role in how youth navigate these tasks. however, given changing norms and laws regarding sexual orientation and gender identity, today’s youth are dealing with these tasks in a very different context than that which existed previously. for example, youth may receive more support from their communities or from online communities, while at the same time, these youth are sometimes facing very intense social scrutiny, social pressure, stigma, and violence. lastly, adolescence and emerging adulthood are also characterized by increasing rates of mental health disorders and exposure to violence, both intimate partner violence and violence in their communities, and increasing mobility. approximately 20% of adolescents have a diagnosable mental health disorder and many mental health disorders first present during adolescence. recent evidence suggests that the number of adolescents and emerging adults who report having a major depressive episode is increasing. other prevalent mental health disorders such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder or externalizing disorders, which are associated with impairments in impulsivity and self-regulation, may also have implications for risk during this time. additionally, youth can experience housing instability due to household changes, migrations, livelihood mobility, and displacement, among others, all of which can disrupt access to health care and impact prevention and treatment efforts during this period of development.while advances in youth hiv research have been made, significant hiv health disparities continue to exist for youth. for these reasons, nimh is calling for research on hiv treatment and prevention that focuses more on developmental factors. specifically, additional research is needed on how developmental factors across adolescence and emerging adulthood 1) influence risk and resilience to hiv, 2) influence how youth cope with living with hiv, 3) affect the impact of hiv prevention and treatment interventions, and 4) can be more adequately incorporated into hiv prevention and treatment interventions to improve their impact.other considerations for this notice:areas of research interestresearch topics encouraged by this notice include,
