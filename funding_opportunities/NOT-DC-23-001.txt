https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-DC-23-001.html
january 5, 2023national institute on deafness and other communication disorders (nidcd)the national institute on deafness and other communication disorders (nidcd) is issuing this notice to highlight priorities from its new strategic plan, in basic and mechanistic research on neural circuits underlying sensory processing in hearing, balance, taste and smell. nidcd encourages multidisciplinary and innovative projects, from diverse teams, to advance a mechanistic understanding of the behavior of neural circuits at cellular and sub-second temporal resolution by integrating cutting-edge technologies and approaches for recording and modulation of cells and circuits (e.g., electrophysiology, optical imaging, optogenetics, chemogenetics, sonogenetics, magnetogenetics, pharmacologic modulation). applications are expected to integrate appropriate domains of expertise, including but not limited to biological, chemical and physical sciences, engineering, computational modeling, statistical analysis, and bioethics, as appropriate. mechanistic human studies and comparative, cross-species projects are highly encouraged.the list below includes representative, but not exhaustive, examples of topics that could be considered responsive to this nosi.applications not responsive to this nosi.application and submission informationthis notice applies to due dates on or after february 5, 2023 and subsequent receipt dates through january 8, 2026.potential applicants to this nosi are strongly encouraged to contact scientific/research staff prior to submission.submit applications for this initiative using one of the following funding opportunity announcements (foas) or any reissues of these announcement through the expiration date of this notice.please note: for this foa, the pd/pi must be no more than 7-years from the date the terminal degree was received. read the foa carefully for specific details and exceptions.please note: applications can include only clinical trials that are considered low risk basic experimental studies involving humans (besh).please note: applications can include only clinical trials that are considered low risk basic experimental studies involving humans (besh).please note: applications can include only clinical trials that are considered low risk basic experimental studies involving humans (besh).please note: applications can include only clinical trials that are considered low risk basic experimental studies involving humans (besh).all instructions in the sf424 (r&r) application guide and the funding opportunity announcement used for submission must be followed, with the following additions:applications nonresponsive to terms of this nosi will not be considered for the nosi initiative.we encourage inquiries concerning this nosi and welcome the opportunity to answer questions from potential applicants.for general inquiries or studies related to taste and smell, please contact:merav sabri, ph.d. national institute on deafness and other communication disorders (nidcd) telephone: 301-827-0908 email: merav.sabri@nih.govfor studies related to hearing and balance, please contact:amy poremba, ph.d. national institute on deafness and other communication disorders (nidcd) telephone: 301-997-3152 email: amy.poremba@nih.govpeer review contact(s)examine your era commons account for review assignment and contact information (information appears two weeks after the submission due date).financial/grants management contact(s) christopher myers national institute on deafness and other communication disorders (nidcd) telephone: 301-435-0713 email: myersc@nidcd.nih.govweekly toc for this announcement nih funding opportunities and noticesnote: for help accessing pdf, rtf, ms word, excel, powerpoint, audio or video files, see help downloading files.
