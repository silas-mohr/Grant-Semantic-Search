announcement (foa) is to support the continued development of new and innovative on-demand, event-driven, and long-acting (systemic and non-systemic) multipurpose prevention technologies (mpts). it supports development of mpts that prevent hiv infection and pregnancy (hormonal and non-hormonal methods); sexually transmitted infections (sti) and pregnancy; or multiple non-hiv sti or hiv/sti mpts in cis and trans males and females of all ages. applications for mpt development may involve pharmacokinetic (pk), pharmacodynamic (pd), safety and, drug-drug interactions (ddi) studies using drug development, and formulation science supported by animal model testing. also supported are biobehavioral and behavioral/social studies to identify mpt user-desired rheological and biophysical factors (look, feel, effectiveness, safety, and duration of action) and other behavioral/social factors that could promote increased mpt adoption and use.not applicableall applications are due by 5:00 pm local time of applicant organization.applicants are encouraged to apply early to allow adequate time to make any corrections to errors found in the application during the submission process by the due date.not applicableit is critical that applicants follow the instructions in the research (r) instructions in the sf424 (r&r) application guide, except where instructed to do otherwise (in this foa or in a notice from nih guide for grants and contracts).conformance to all requirements (both in the application guide and the foa) is required and strictly enforced. applicants must read and follow all application instructions in the application guide as well as any program-specific instructions noted in section iv. when the program-specific instructions deviate from those in the application guide, follow the program-specific instructions.applications that do not comply with these instructions may be delayed or not accepted for review.there are several options available to submit your application through grants.gov to nih and department of health and human services partners. you must use one of these submission options to access the application forms for this opportunity.purpose and backgroundthe objective of this foa is to support continued development of new and innovative on-demand, event-driven, and long-acting (systemic and non-systemic) multipurpose prevention technologies (mpts) for the purposes of pregnancy and sti or hiv prevention and prevention of multiple non-hiv sti or hiv/sti mpts in cis and trans males and females of all ages, as appropriate. of specific interest to general mpt development are efforts focused on specific sub-populations where mpts may have a particular benefit such as, adolescent girls, women and men in serodiscordant partnerships, men who have sex with men (msm), individuals who practice receptive anal intercourse (rai) or engage in high-risk sexual encounters that place them at high risk for stis or hiv, health disparity populations that are disproportionately infected by hiv or other stis, and individuals who may desire the convenience of a multi-component prevention strategy.mpts are composed of a combination of drugs that can target prevention of pregnancy, stis (e.g. gonorrhea, syphilis, chlamydia,trichomonas vaginalis, human papilloma virus (hpv), herpes virus (hsv), etc.) and/or hiv, delivered using either an on-demand and event-driven or long-acting drug delivery system (dds) with rheological/biophysical properties and product user perceptions (look, feel, effectiveness, safety and duration of action) that support user uptake (first use, subsequent use and habitual use). the hypothetical power of the mpt concept is that by combining prevention products for pregnancy and hiv or sti, the mpt may have a greater uptake and adherence than individual products. key to the concept of mpts is creation of dds to support convenience of use, that not only are safe and deliver the drugs consistently but have durations of action relevant to the user needs. mpts (contraceptive and non-contraceptive) may encompass a wide range of delivery durations and use patterns from on demand, event-driven or sustained/extended-release durations (months to years).mpts in general represent an unmet need for both cis and trans males and females. the first generation of contraceptive/hiv mpts using a drug development strategy focused on adapting the contraceptive hormone levonorgestrel (lng) to intravaginal rings (ivr) containing tenofovir or dapivirine are undergoing initial clinical testing, whereas development of hiv/sti, contraceptive/sti and non-hiv sti mpts are in preclinical development. creation of mpts with a range of sti prevention, contraception and anti-hiv drug choices that are convenient and retain the efficacy/safety of single component drugs will be a critical factor in getting individuals to choose an mpt, since it is unlikely that reduced efficacy and/or convenience will entice substitution of an mpt for a more familiar and/or trusted single drug treatment/prevention regimen. thus, close attention to pharmacokinetics (pk)/ pharmacodynamics (pd) of the constituents of the mpt and biophysical properties of the dds, as they pertain to user preferences and needs, are essential components required for creating new, effective strategies that are purpose designed to meet the needs of at-risk individuals and those desirous of a multi-component prevention strategy.specific areas of research interestapplicants are encouraged to consider specifying clinical and nonclinical research milestones and timelines for their proposed research. inclusion of biobehavioral research, integrated into an mpt drug development program, focused on optimizing the rheological and biophysical properties of the product for use by target populations is encouraged. applications may address one or more of the following interest topics.niaidnimhnimh is interested in studies that include an hiv prevention component.nichdnichd's maternal and pediatric infectious disease branch (mpidb) is particularly interested in efforts targeting infants, children, adolescents and young adults and/or pregnant women.nichd’s contraception research branch (crb) is particularly interested in the development of new and improved methods of contraception, including multipurpose prevention technologies which include a contraceptive component.special note: consultation with niaid/nimh/nichd staff prior to submission of an application is strongly encouraged.applications not

for scientific and technical merit through the nih peer review system.for this particular announcement, note the following:the r01-based ngm program is intended to identify high-risk and innovative research that can contribute significantly to the creation of new mpt strategies for prevention of pregnancy: hiv, pregnancy: sti, hiv: sti or multiple non-hiv stis for cis and trans men and women of all ages. preliminary data plays a significant role in providing a justification or rationale for the approach taken. however, the high level of innovation and risk that may be associated with ngm applications may not be supported by extensive preliminary data that is specific or all-inclusive to the proposed mpt strategy. judgments regarding potential success for the proposed research may require reliance upon inferential data/results to establish the potential for research impact/success rather than substantial experimental data directly supporting the proposed mpt.a proposed clinical trial application may include study design, methods, and intervention that are not by themselves innovative but address important questions or unmet needs. additionally, the results of the clinical trial may indicate that further clinical development of the intervention is unwarranted or lead to new avenues of scientific investigation.overall impactreviewers will provide an overall impact score to reflect their assessment of the likelihood for the project to exert a sustained, powerful influence on the research field(s) involved, in consideration of the following review criteria and
