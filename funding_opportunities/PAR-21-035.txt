a national institutes of health (nih) policy, set forth in not-od-16-147, to create funding opportunity announcements (foas) that are specifically designed for applications that involve clinical trials, the national cancer institute (nci) has established two r01 investigator-initiated clinical trials required program announcements. this foa is to support phase 0-iv clinical trials with the potential to reduce the burden of cancer for patients and other affected persons through improvements in early detection, prevention, healthcare delivery, quality of life, and/or survivorship related to cancer, all of which are program areas identified by nci's division of cancer prevention (dcp; https://dcp.cancer.gov) and/or nci's division of cancer control and population sciences (dccps; https://dccps.cancer.gov). this foa does not and will not support clinical trials to study cancer diagnoses and/or medical interventions (oncologic treatments) in cancer patients; such research will be supported through another foa, par-21-033, which is relevant to phase 0, i, and ii interventional clinical trials supported by nci through its division of cancer treatment and diagnosis (dctd).as of january 25, 2018, applicants who plan to conduct cancer-related clinical trials via the investigator-initiated pathway may submit their applications to one of the two foas mentioned above since nci is not participating in the nih "parent" r01 (clinical trials required) foa, pa-20-183. however, applicants who propose to conduct research that does not involve a clinical trial will be able to submit their ideas and concepts to the nih "parent" r01 (no clinical trials allowed) foa, pa-20-185.an application to be supported by this foa must propose a phase 0-iv clinical trial involving investigations in cancer prevention or control that should contribute to the advancement of evidence–based medicine and the practice that supports it. nih defines a clinical trial as "a research study in which one or more human subjects are prospectively assigned to one or more interventions (which may include placebo or other control) to evaluate the effects of those interventions on health-related biomedical or behavioral outcomes" (not-od-15-015). applications submitted to this foa must meet the nih definition of a clinical trial and provide specific clinical trial information as described in this foa and the nih application form f guidelines (not-od-20-026). furthermore, investigators who are involved in clinical trials supported through this foa are expected to follow the nih policy on good clinical practice (see not-od-16-148).general area of researchthis foa is applicable to a broad range of research supported through the nci's division of cancer prevention (dcp) and the nci's division of cancer control and population sciences (dccps).examples of relevant areas of research include but are not limited to:scope of work and additional guidanceapplicants proposing to conduct behavioral intervention research are encouraged to use an existing framework, such as the orbit model for developing behavioral treatments (http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/hea0000161), to determine the clinical trial phase being proposed and for guidance on study designs and methods appropriate for early-phase (phase 0, i, and ii) translational behavioral research. applicants may also wish to reference other frameworks in their application, such as the experimental medicine approach (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc4656226/) as defined by the science of behavior change common fund initiative when proposing basic, mechanistic, and early-phase translational behavioral studies. applicants may propose to conduct a clinical trial or trials, or in combination with other research aims as appropriate.this foa is not intended for observational studies, which may be submitted as r01 applications to the nih "parent" r01 foa, pa-20-185, or other relevant nih foas. other types of human subject research that do not fit the nih definition of a clinical trial may also be submitted to the nih parent r01 foa.with regard to support for phase iii clinical trials, this foa will only support applications proposing phase iii clinical trials that are limited to public health interventions, healthcare delivery research (e.g., supportive care, palliative care, and symptom management), and other psychosocial, behavioral, environmental, policy, health system, or implementation strategies, and related interventions to address cancer prevention and control, provided they can be completed entirely within the grant cycle. this foa is not intended to support phase iii clinical trials to test the efficacy of cancer-related medical (oncologic) interventions or phase iii clinical trials of cancer imaging (or other diagnostic) modalities.applications that propose clinical trials sought by and to be supported through this foa can include studies planned to be conducted through special nci programs and networks such as, the specialized programs of research excellence (spores), cancer centers, and/or the nci community oncology research program (ncorp). the studies may include correlative laboratory, imaging studies, and/or other trial-related study endpoints. investigators conducting studies in the ncorp should contact the nci ncorp research base program officer prior to submission of the application. budget requests for projects to be conducted through otherwise supported nci clinical trials infrastructure cannot include support (i.e., funds) that would duplicate that already supported infrastructure.applications not responsive to this foathe following types of clinical trials are not responsive to this foa and applications proposing such activities will be deemed non-responsive and will not be reviewed:note:applicants to this foa are strongly encouraged to contact nci staff as soon as possible in the development of the application (preferably no later than 12 weeks prior to the application due date) to discuss the details of their proposed clinical trial, so that nci staff can help the applicant understand whether the proposed clinical trial is within the goals and mission of the nci and is appropriate for this foa.see section viii. other information for award authorities and regulations.grant: a support mechanism providing money, property,
