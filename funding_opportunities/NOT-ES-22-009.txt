institute of environmental health science (niehs), in partnership with fogarty international center (fic), national institute of minority health and health disparities (nimhd), eunice kennedy shriver national institute of child health and human development (nichd), national institute of mental health (nimh), national institute of nursing research (ninr), national heart blood and lung institute (nhbli) and national institute of allergy and infectious disease (niaid), is leading an nih-wide climate change and health initiative (cchi) with the goals of: reducing the health threats posed by climate change across the lifespan. improving the health of people who are disproportionately affected by climate change impacts; and building health resilience among individuals, communities, and nations around the world. as a part of this cchi, this nosi encourages phase i (r41), and direct to phase ii (r42) sttr grant applications from sbcs to develop commercializable tools, resources, and approaches to capture the effects of climate change and the associated impacts of extreme weather events on human health and to support adaptation or mitigation strategies to minimize health hazards and impacts from climate change. technologies may include new approaches for detecting climate change-associated exposures, including temperature and air quality, training tools on climate change and mitigation strategies for patients with underlying health conditions, intervention approaches for reducing contaminants water or in indoor air, modeling and prediction tools for climate-change-related weather events and related health effects, and technologies for delivery of health care, including mental health services to communities during extreme weather events.backgroundclimate change poses substantial threats to human health across a wide range of illnesses and injuries, including asthma, respiratory allergies and airway diseases, cardiovascular disease and stroke, heat-related illness and deaths, reproductive, birth outcomes and developmental effects, mental illness, and extreme weather-related morbidity and mortality. strong evidence indicates that climate change also disproportionately adversely affects communities that experience socioeconomic, behavioral, and environmental vulnerabilities. such communities include underserved and health disparity populations, especially racial and ethnic minority populations , underserved rural populations, less privileged socioeconomic status (ses) populations, sexual and gender minorities (sgm), and those unduly burdened by exposure to environmental pollution. in addition to the need for research on understanding the effects of these emerging threats on human health, there is a significant need for adaptation efforts to reduce the hazards and negative impacts of climate change on human health. development of innovative tools, technologies, and methodologies on climate change and health will significantly increase the potential for understanding the complex drivers of adverse health outcomes and enable effective and impactful interventions.objectivesareas of interest and examples of applications that are responsive to this nosi include, but are not limited to, development of technologies from these institutes and centers:niehsthe mission of the national institute of environmental health sciences

communication strategy that encompasses training, education, technology transfer and community outreach. https://www.niehs.nih.gov/research/supported/translational/sbir/index.cfmniehs and nhlbinhlbithe national heart, lung, and blood institute (nhlbi) provides global leadership for a research, training, and education program to promote the prevention and treatment of heart, lung, and blood diseases and enhance the health of all individuals so that they can live longer and more fulfilling lives.the nhlbi stimulates basic discoveries about the causes of disease, enables the translation of basic discoveries into clinical practice, fosters training and mentoring of emerging scientists and physicians, and communicates research advances to the public. it creates and supports a robust, collaborative research infrastructure in partnership with private and public organizations, including academic institutions, industry, and other government agencies. the institute collaborates with patients, families, health care professionals, scientists, professional societies, patient advocacy groups, community organizations, and the media to promote the application of research results and leverage resources to address public health needs. the nhlbi also collaborates with international organizations to help reduce the burden of heart, lung, and blood diseases worldwide. nhlbi small business programs | seed (nih.gov)neithe mission of the national eye institute (nei) is to eliminate vision loss and improve quality of life through vision research. nei is interested in developing novel tools, therapies, and diagnostics to treat diseases and disorders of the visual system. for additional information on nei’s sbir/sttr program, please refer to https://www.nei.nih.gov/grants-and-training/funding-opportunities/programs-and-research-priorities/small-business.the development of diagnostics, therapeutics, and disease prevention solutions for eye diseases and disorders exacerbated by climate change and other related environmental factors including toxin exposure, uv radiation, ozone depletion, and other related stress disorders affecting vision. nei is particularly interested in supporting applications examining the impact of climate change and related environmental factors on dry eye disease, refractive error, photokeratitis, cataract onset and progression, and vector-borne diseases. applications developing technologies, apps, or tools to enable effective delivery of eye health services impacted by climate events are also requested.niathe mission of the national institute on aging (nia) is to support and conduct genetic, biological, clinical, behavioral, social, and economic research on aging, foster the development of research and clinician scientists in aging, provide research resources, and disseminate information about aging and advances in research to the public, health care professionals, and the scientific community, among a variety of audiences. https://www.nia.nih.gov/research/sbirniaidthe mission of the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases (niaid) is to conduct and support basic and applied research to better understand, treat, and ultimately prevent infectious, immunologic, and allergic diseases. our small business programs help bridge the gap between basic science and commercialization of new therapies, vaccines, diagnostic tests, and other technologies. additional information can be found here: https://www.niaid.nih.gov/grants-contracts/small-businesses. areas of
