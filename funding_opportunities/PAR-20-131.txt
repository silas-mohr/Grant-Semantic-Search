applications for projects to expand, improve, or transform the utility of mammalian cancer and tumor models for translational research.with this foa, the nci intends to encourage submission of projects devoted to demonstrating that mammalian models or their derivatives used for translational research are robust representations of human biology, are appropriate to test questions of clinical importance, and provide reliable information for patients' benefit. these practical goals contrast with the goals of many mechanistic, nci-supported r01 projects that use mammals, or develop and use mammalian cancer models, transplantation tumor models, or models derived from mammalian or human tissues or cells for hypothesis-testing, non-clinical research. among many other possible endeavors, applicants in response to this foa could propose demonstrations of how to overcome translational deficiencies of mammalian oncology models, define new uses of mammalian models or their genetics for unexplored translational challenges, advance standard practices for use of translational models, test approaches to validate and credential models, or challenge current practices for how models are used translationally.march 12, 2020not applicablestandard dates apply.the first standard due date for this foa is june 05, 2020all applications are due by 5:00 pm local time of applicant organization.

translational challenges, advance standard practices for use of translational models, test approaches to validate and credential models, or challenge current practices for how models are used translationally.backgroundmammalian models and their derivatives are integral components of basic cancer research. spurring the use of models are rapidly evolving technology platforms to alter gene expression in mammals and cells and to genotype, phenotype, and image animals; exquisitely sensitive methods to detect analytes of many kinds in small volumes of body fluids or specimens; large stores of human patient data for cross-species comparison; and a suite of bioinformatics tools that enable multi-scale integration of mammalian model data with human data. because they are often widely available, mammalian models originally designed for non-clinical research are increasingly applied translationally for developing and testing therapy, prevention, early detection, and risk assessment. however, for each of these applications, there is a need to address a variety of practical issues that relate to optimal model choice for specific translational questions. one example is defining which mammalian models (cell lines, cell transplants, patient tumor-grafts (pdxs), genetically engineered models, standard transgenic or carcinogen-induced models, spontaneous models, or organoid or culture models derived from ipscs, or normal, cancer, or tumor cells) are reliable surrogates of patients. other examples are designing and testing updated translational validation or credentialing criteria for newly generated non-clinical or pre-clinical models, delineating and refining best practices for translational uses of models, or ascertaining the biological relevance of currently available models to specific human malignancies or their subsets. additional possibilities include testing novel approaches that enable models to be suitable for previously unexplored translational opportunities, further development of available or novel imaging technologies, or developing informatics tools and resources to empower integrated mammalian model/human translational research. despite nci's significant level of investment in deriving, discovering, or testing mechanistic hypotheses in mammalian models in non-clinical research, there remains a substantial need for the nci to encourage submission of projects that address the many practical issues that pertain to robust translational applications of mammalian models.specific research objectivesthe three major goals for this foa are as follows:the first goal is for applicants to address one or more of the technical and experimental parameters that ensure effective translational use of mammalian models. numerous publications illustrate that data from animal models can inform the conduct and clarify the outcomes of clinical trials, and present new prospects for treating patients with resistant, recurrent, or metastatic disease. candidate biomarkers from mammalian models can be informative for patients screening, and the genetics of animals can inform the genetics of human risk and response or resistance to therapy or preventive interventions. the effectiveness of each model depends in part on acquiring high-quality, robust experimental data. in addition, integral use of different kinds of models is crucial, the choices of which models to use are governed by the translational questions, and using more than one modeling approach is advisable to have confidence in the data that are applied to human research. applicants to this foa could better define how these positive attributes of models can improve oncology practice.the second goal is for applicants to identify and propose the means to address unmet translational requirements. for example, the rapidly emerging clinical utility of immunotherapy and cancer prevention vaccines creates many opportunities for robust mammalian models of numerous species and technological approaches. novel tactics are clearly required to produce and validate metastasis models that support interventions testing, a pressing clinical need. another question is how predictive, and for what (e.g., outcome, dose, adverse events, etc.) is testing combinations of several small-molecule drugs, or small molecule drugs and immune modulators in mammalian models for individual, or populations of, patients. regularized procedures for performing pre-clinical testing of radiation with other modalities are needed. an important translational question is what are the appropriate models and pre-clinical or co-clinical protocols for testing alternative therapy schedules, such as chronotherapy or metronomic delivery. the adverse events, toxicities, and late effects associated with cancer therapy, and relapse and recurrence are considerable clinical problems; effective strategies for co- and post-clinical use of mammalian models to identify and test biomarkers of these confounding problems as they emerge are needed. many mammalian population genetics approaches with translational value for human risk assessment are under-utilized in oncology. cross-species discovery of the genetic and environmental bases of cancer susceptibility and resistance, progression of early cancer lesions to invasive tumors, propensity to metastasize, and response or resistance to therapy are a few testable genetics questions. another major translational modeling gap is suitable ways to use human specimens of early cancer lesions to enable development of early detection approaches, to predict systemic effects such as cachexia, or to discover biomarkers of progression.the third goal is for applicants to take advantage of the oncology models forum ncip hub platform to facilitate collaborations that require sharing large amounts of data or images or developing informatics tools. applicants who propose to use this platform will be expected to collaborate with the awardees of the oncology models forum and the nci to ensure that they take full advantage of the capabilities of the ncip hub resource. not all projects that are submitted to this foa will benefit from use of the ncip hub platform. awardees of this foa are encouraged to attend the annual meetings of the oncology models forum and participate in forum workshops and webinars.projects that are suitable for this foa include but are not limited to the examples that follow:projects that are not appropriate for this foa include:grant: a support mechanism providing money, property, or both
