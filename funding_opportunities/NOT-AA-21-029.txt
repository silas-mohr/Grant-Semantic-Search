(niaaa)the purpose of this notice of special interest (nosi) is to provide enhanced understanding of genetic, genomic, and epigenetic factors contributing to biological processes for individual variation in sensitivity, the development of tolerance, and progression to aud. niaaa is interested in projects that will develop innovative strategies integrating both experimental and bioinformatics approaches to establish causality for candidate genes from gwas and linkage studies and to provide insights into genetic mechanisms of alcohol sensitivity and the development of tolerance through investigation of genomic, epigenetic, or transcriptional variation, and gene network and pathway analyses. applicants are encouraged to consider model systems in which these complex relationships can be better studied under defined genetic backgrounds and well-controlled environmental conditions.backgroundwhile many americans drink alcohol, for some, drinking becomes problematic, potentially leading to an alcohol use disorder (aud). initial response to alcohol ingestion, sometimes known as sensitivity, may predict aud development later in life. low sensitivity is associated with high probability of developing an aud. following initial exposure, responses to alcohol change with subsequent drinking. alcohol tolerance is a complex phenomenon in which increased alcohol intake is required to achieve a given effect, e.g., the feeling of intoxication, and is a defining feature of aud. stated in another way, tolerance decreases the effect of a defined alcohol dose, and reflects individual differences in sensitivity to pharmacologic effects of alcohol and physiological adaptation to alcohol exposure.responses to alcohol and the propensity to develop aud vary significantly within and across populations, and are greatly influenced by family history of aud. family linkage and genome-wide association studies identified numerous candidate genes and genetic variations implicated in and contributing to alcohol sensitivity and tolerance. candidate genes include gamma-aminobutyric acid (gaba) receptors, serotonin transporter, opioid receptor, and nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, as well as those for alcohol-metabolizing enzymes. yet, their contribution to individual variation in alcohol sensitivity and tolerance and their contribution to underlying biological mechanisms remain largely unknown. this is in part because: 1) study cohorts vary in age, sex, previous alcohol exposure history, drinking context, and 2) response variables are often subjective, while objective measures are not comparable between studies.mechanisms underlying sensitivity and tolerance to alcohol are not well known, since alcohol responses are complex, multifactorial, and influenced both by genetic factors and environmental variables such as drinking context and stress exposure. various studies have revealed different aspects of the genetic underpinnings of alcohol effects. combining and integrating our knowledge from human genetic studies with information from studies of model organisms will be a productive strategy for investigating gene x gene (g x g), gene x environment (g x e) interactions, and epigenetic contributions to the underlying genetic mechanisms.specific areas of research interestexamples of potential research topics include, but are not limited to:notes on prioritiesthe following will be considered non-responsive to this nosi:the use of standardized models and transgenic animals especially for translational research is preferred.applicants are strongly encouraged to consult the scientific/research contact listed below to discuss the alignment of their proposed work with the objectives of this foa.note on niaaa's interest in diversityresearch shows that diverse teams working together outperform homogenous teams. scientists and trainees from diverse backgrounds and with different life experiences bring different perspectives, creativity, and individual enterprise to address complex scientific problems. diverse teams of scientists will lead the way to develop more innovative inclusive research that will more broadly enhance public health. fostering diversity by addressing underrepresentation in the scientific research workforce is a key component of the nih strategy to identify, develop, support, and maintain the quality of our scientific workforce. it is expected that the research program will include a diverse group of scientists, including individuals from underrepresented backgrounds as per not-od-20-031 (notice of nih's interest in diversity). niaaa is especially interested in enhancing diversity representation including, but not to the exclusion of others, from racial, ethnic and gender minorities and early-stage investigators.application and submission informationthis notice applies to due dates on or after october 5, 2021 and subsequent receipt dates
