september 13, 2022pa-20-200 - nih small research grant program (parent r03 clinical trial not allowed)national institute on aging (nia)this notice of special interest (nosi) invites applications for small research grants that align with the goals of the national academy of medicine's healthy longevity grand challenge, as well as the national institute on aging's (nia) interests in supporting research to promote a long healthspan and functional independence in both aging and alzheimer’s disease and alzheimer’s disease-related dementias (ad/adrd).backgroundthe national academy of medicine (nam), one of three academies that make up the national academies of sciences, engineering, and medicine (nasem), launched the healthy longevity global grand challenge as a “worldwide movement to improve physical, mental, and social well-being for people as they age.” the initiative includes the healthy longevity global competition, which brings together an international community of funding agencies to foster innovations around the world in support of improving health and function in older age. the competition comprises three phases: the catalyst phase (small awards to stimulate innovation), the accelerator phase (awards made to meritorious catalyst phase awardees to advance their work), and the grand prize phase (prizes awarded to projects that have made significant breakthroughs in extending human healthspan).nia participated in the catalyst phase in 2020 through rfa-ag-20-027, “innovations to foster healthy longevity in low-income settings (r03 clinical trial not allowed).” nasem has extended the catalyst phase through 2025 and nia is continuing its involvement in the initiative through issuance of this nosi.research objectivesnia is interested in projects that reflect its mission to support research on aging, the aging process, and diseases and conditions associated with growing older, including ad/adrd. applications that reflect nia’s programmatic interests in genetic, biological, clinical, epidemiological, neuroscience, behavioral, social, and economic research on aging as they relate to healthy longevity are encouraged. projects should inform the overall mission of the healthy longevity global grand challenge and include bold, new, and innovative ideas to extend health and function as people age.examples of topic areas responsive to this nosi include, but are not limited to, the following:when developing research plans, applicants are encouraged to consider the nia health disparities research framework, which highlights priority populations of interest to nia, the integration of exposures and mechanisms in biological, behavioral, sociocultural, and environmental domains, and a life course perspective. additionally, applicants are encouraged to factor sex as a biological variable into research designs, analyses, and reporting in vertebrate animal and human studies.research programs that include populations considered vulnerable or under-researched (e.g., women, indigenous populations, populations in adverse environmental settings, etc.) in low- and middle-income countries are also encouraged.application and submission informationthis notice applies to due dates on or after february 16, 2023 and subsequent receipt dates through may 8, 2023.submit applications for this initiative using the following funding opportunity announcement (foa) or any reissues of the announcement through the expiration date of this notice.all instructions in the sf424 (r&r) application guide and the funding opportunity announcement used for submission must be followed, with the following additions:applications nonresponsive to terms of this nosi will not be considered for the nosi initiative.nia scientific/research contact(s)francesca macchiarini, ph.d., ms division of aging biology (dab) telephone: 301-827-4013 email: francesca.macchiarini@nih.govlaura major, drph, mph division of behavioral and social research (dbsr) telephone: 301-496-3136 email: laura.major@nih.govdamali martin, ph.d., mph division of neuroscience (dn) telephone: 301-402-8310 email: martinda@mail.nih.govnalini raghavachari, ph.d. division of geriatrics and clinical gerontology (dgcg) telephone: 301-496-6942 email: nraghavachari@mail.nih.govweekly toc for this announcement nih funding opportunities and noticesnote: for help accessing pdf, rtf, ms word, excel, powerpoint, audio or video files, see help downloading files.
