notices of special interest associated with this funding opportunitysee section iii. 3. additional information on eligibility.this funding opportunity announcement (foa) invites research projects that seek to explain the underlying mechanisms, processes, and trajectories of social relationships and how these factors affect outcomes in human health, illness, recovery, and overall wellbeing. types of projects submitted under this foa include studies that prospectively assign human participants to conditions (i.e., experimentally manipulate independent variables) and that assess biomedical and/or behavioral outcomes in humans to understand fundamental aspects of phenomena related to social connectedness and isolation. nih considers such studies as basic experimental studies with humans (besh) that are prospective basic science studies involving human participants that meet the nih definition of basic research and fall within the nih definition of clinical trials (see, e.g., not-od-19-024). applications should not propose a goal of clinical outcomes or products. applications that propose studies including model animal research or observational studies involving humans should submit under the companion foa, par-21-350 "research on biopsychosocial factors of social connectedness and isolation on health, wellbeing, illness, and recovery (r01 clinical trials not allowed).not applicableall applications are due by 5:00 pm local time of applicant organization. all types of non-aids applications allowed for this funding opportunity announcement are due on the listed date(s).applicants are encouraged to apply early to allow adequate time to make any corrections to errors found in the application during the submission process by the due date.not applicableit is critical that applicants follow the instructions in the research (r) instructions in the sf424 (r&r) application guide,except where instructed to do otherwise (in this foa or in a notice from nih guide for grants and contracts ).conformance to all requirements (both in the application guide and the foa) is required and strictly enforced. applicants must read and follow all application instructions in the application guide as well as any program-specific instructions noted in section iv. when the program-specific instructions deviate from those in the application guide, follow the program-specific instructions.applications that do not comply with these instructions may be delayed or not accepted for review.there are several options available to submit your application through grants.gov to nih and department of health and human services partners. you must use one of these submission options to access the application forms for this opportunity.all applications submitted to this funding opportunity announcement must propose basic science experimental studies involving humans, otherwise referred to in not-od-18-212 as “prospective basic science studies involving human participants,” that fall within the nih definition of a clinical trial and meet the definition of basic research.nih defines basic research consistent with the definition of basic research in federal code, “the systematic study directed toward greater knowledge or understanding of the fundamental aspects of phenomena and of observable facts without specific applications towards processes or products in mind” (32 cfr 272.3).nih defines a clinical trial as "a research study in which one or more human subjects are prospectively assigned to one or more interventions (which may include placebo or other control) to evaluate the effects of those interventions on health-related biomedical or behavioral outcomes" (not-od-15-015).types of studies that should submit under this foa include studies that prospectively assign human participants to conditions (i.e., experimentally manipulate independent variables) and that assess biomedical or behavioral outcomes in humans for the purpose of understanding the fundamental aspects of phenomena without specific application towards processes or products in mind.for the purposes of this foa, “specific application towards processes or products” refers to the application of biomedical or behavioral products, procedures, or services intended to affect a health-related outcome of the individual or a group of individuals either by better understanding the mechanism of action of an intervention or a measurable improvement in health.basic experimental studies in which participants are prospectively assigned to experimental conditions and receive an intervention or experimental manipulation where the effect will be assessed for the purpose of understanding fundamental aspects of phenomena may submit under this foa.please refer to the table comparing funding opportunity types by clinical trial allowability for additional guidance on the most appropriate foa for the type of study.purposethis funding opportunity announcement (foa) invites research projects that seek to explain the underlying mechanisms, processes, and trajectories of social relationships and how these factors affect outcomes in human health, illness, recovery, and overall wellbeing.research areas of interest include understanding differences and similarities between objective social isolation and loneliness, how complex biopsychosocial processes are regulated in the body, what occurs in response to dysregulation, and antecedent processes that influence responses to the trajectories of social relationships. studies that involve neurobiological approaches—for example, how social or isolated settings influence neurobiological systems, brain function, and/or behavior are welcome. projects designed to study how changes in the quantity and/or quality of social connections influence health behaviors and outcomes are encouraged. this foa also encourages projects that incorporate aims to promote methods and measures needed to support a cumulative and integrated approach to the study of social connectedness and isolation.the terms "social connection" and "social connectedness" often are used interchangeably in research. for the purposes of this foa, "social connectedness" encompasses both perceived and actual connections to others, as well as an individual's perception of belongingness to the social environment. researchers with questions regarding these terms should inquire with ic scientific contacts.all applications submitted through this foa must propose basic science experimental studies with humans, also referred to in not-od-18-212 as “prospective basic science studies involving human participants.” these studies meet the nih definition of basic research and the nih definition of a clinical trial. observational studies involving humans should submit under the companion clinical trials not allowed version of this foa.backgroundit is well-established that social ties can facilitate overall wellbeing, recovery from acute illness, and self-management of chronic conditions. less well understood are the processes by which connection and isolation lead to positive or negative impacts on health, wellbeing, illness, or recovery. a more comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms, processes, and trajectories involved in social connectedness and isolation may identify novel targets to inform future intervention developments and to strengthen individual and group functions.for example, the prefrontal cortex can handle multiple, yet not infinite, concurrent processes. changes in prefrontal processing may lead individuals to adaptively self-isolate as one way to reduce external social stimulation, to protect or avoid stress, or to focus on specific cognitive tasks. yet extended isolation can lead to negative changes in neuronal size, activity patterns, and intracellular processes that can reduce cognitive and sensory capacities and subsequent behavior.social media usage, such as sharing photos and videos with family members and friends, can facilitate connections and have salutary effects. social media also can be used to publicly bully or shame others, often youth. targets of social media abuse consequently may engage in maladaptive behaviors including aggression, delinquency, substance use and misuse, self-harm, social withdrawal, or suicidal ideation. we currently lack an understanding of the biopsychosocial processes that facilitate wellbeing among some youth who use social media but not others.this foa solicits research to better understand the basic individual, social, and biobehavioral processes by which social connectedness and isolation have positive or negative impacts across the lifespan. it encourages projects that explore the relationships between various factors, including those that can be objectively measured (e.g., biomeasures or data from health records, occurrence or length of relationship disruption) and those that require self-report.the arena of social connectedness, connection, and isolation health research is relatively new, and therefore ripe for construct, theory, and measurement mapping and measurement harmonization efforts. therefore, in addition to understanding the mechanistic relationships between aspects of social connection and isolation in health contexts, research projects in the areas such as knowledge representation and behavioral ontology development are welcomed. if appropriate, projects may use nih-supported common data elements (cdes), electronic health record data, and/or propose sophisticated statistical analyses of existing and/or synthesized datasets that lead to hypotheses for testing in humans or animals--though applications proposing model animal research should submit through the companion foa mentioned above.research projects focused on either animal or human subjects are encouraged. also encouraged are projects that strive to determine optimal measurement approaches across species, that validate and utilize measures across the lifespan, and that test measures in a range of clinical contexts.this foa solicits r01 applications that may range between 2-5 years. the r01 mechanism, common to all nih icos participating in this foa, was chosen expressly to empower investigators to propose innovative scopes of work with correspondingly appropriate budgets. regardless of the number of project-years proposed, investigators should budget each year for travel to an annual meeting of grantees on or near the nih campus in bethesda, md, to share research methods and findings. awardees will be encouraged to work together on some shared scientific opportunities at the annual meeting and across the award period.three areas of focus especially of interest to oppnet and participating nih icos include, but are not limited to, those below:1. effects of social connectedness, connection, and isolation across the lifespanabout oppnetoppnet is a trans-nih initiative that funds research activities that build the collective body of knowledge on the nature of behaviors and social systems and deepen our understanding of basic social-behavioral mechanisms and processes. all oppnet initiatives invite investigators to propose research projects that will advance basic social and behavioral sciences and produce knowledge and/or tools of potential relevance to multiple domains of health research. all nih institutes and centers that fund research and program coordination offices within the nih office of the director (icos) collectively manage oppnet's scientific direction yet may not participate in every oppnet foa. therefore, applicants should review the list of icos in this foa's components of participating organizations to ensure that a proposed research project aligns with at least one nih ic, its mission, and its interests delineated below. for more information about oppnet, visit https://oppnet.nih.gov.oppnet strives to ensure that proposed projects focus primarily on basic socio-behavioral and biopsychosocial sciences. though oppnet defers from imposing a definition on the field, oppnet uses the following statement to guide the concepts it develops toward funding opportunity announcements: basic behavioral and social sciences research (b-bssr) furthers our understanding of fundamental mechanisms and patterns of behavioral and social functioning, relevant to the nation's health and wellbeing, and as they interact with each other, with biology, and with the environment. oppnet acknowledges that disease-, risk-, and wellness-contexts can provide opportunities to study basic behavioral or social processes, basic biobehavioral or biosocial interrelationships, or methodology and measurement relevant to b-bssr.research objectivesoppnet recognizes that basic research in the behavioral and social sciences can be conducted in a broad variety of settings, including general population and clinical samples. it can also be embedded within studies that include disease (or risk-factor) outcomes, so long as the focus of the study is on basic behavioral or social processes, basic biobehavioral or biosocial interrelationships, or methodology and measurement relevant to bssr research. basic experimental studies designed to understand a behavioral, biological, and/or sociological process(es) and/or mechanism(s) are welcome. mechanistic behavioral trials and large-scale clinical trials that propose to influence a clinical outcome are ineligible for this foa. applications submitted cannot include any specific aims that propose to measure clinical efficacy or effectiveness of any intervention. investigators who wish to conduct studies with clinical endpoints as the primary outcomes should consider other nih foas. the ics participating in this foa have specific interests and priorities listed below. oppnet strongly encourages researchers to contact scientific/research contacts well in advance of submitting applications.national center for complementary and integrative health (nccih)understanding mechanisms of action through which complementary and integrative health approaches affect social connection and isolation on health, resiliency, and well-being across the lifespan. examples of complementary and integrative health approaches relevant to this foa include, but are not restricted to,national cancer institute (nci)understanding mechanisms through which social connectedness and social isolation influence cancer prevention and control outcomes, including:studies that engage individuals and segments of the u.s. population that have been typically underrepresented, underserved, and excluded from biomedical, clinical, behavioral, and social sciences research are encouraged.national eye institute (nei)social connection and isolation across the lifespan in people with visual impairment (i.e., living with blindness or low vision), including but not limited to:national institute on aging (nia)causal pathways and mechanisms through which social connectedness and social isolation are associated with health and well-being in aging, including but not limited to:national institute on alcohol abuse and alcoholism (niaaa)impact of social connection and/or isolation across the lifespan, e.g.,research shows that diverse teams working together outperform homogenous teams. scientists and trainees from diverse backgrounds and with different life experiences bring different perspectives, creativity, and individual enterprise to address complex scientific problems. diverse teams of scientists will lead the way to develop more innovative inclusive research that will more broadly enhance public health. fostering diversity by addressing underrepresentation in the scientific research workforce is a key component of the nih strategy to identify, develop, support, and maintain the quality of our scientific workforce. it is expected that the alcohol research centers will include a diverse group of scientists, including individuals from underrepresented backgrounds as per not od 20-031 (notice of nih's interest in diversity). niaaa is especially interested in enhancing representation from racial, ethnic and gender minorities and early-stage investigators.eunice kennedy shriver national institute on child health and human development (nichd)typical and atypical social development in childhood and adolescencenational institute of dental and craniofacial research (nidcr)mechanistic research on the processes underlying social connection or isolation as they relate to dental, oral, or craniofacial health. specific topics may include:national institute on drug abuse (nida)mechanistic research on the impact of social connection or isolation on the substance use trajectory, including but not limited to:national institute on mental health (nimh) mechanistic studies of the biopsychosocial causes and effects of social connection and isolation across the lifespan, including but not limited to:national institute on minority health and health disparities (nimhd)the mission of the nimhd is to lead scientific research to improve minority health and reduce health disparities. nimhd supports the study of many aspects of minority health and health disparities— from biological and population sciences to clinical, behavioral, and translational research, as well as research on health care services, health systems and workforce development. nimhd focuses on the full continuum of causes of health disparities and the interrelation of these causes. projects must include a focus on one or more of the following nih-designated populations that experience health disparities in the united states: african americans, latinos/hispanics, american indians and alaska natives, asian americans, native hawaiians and other pacific islanders, less privileged socioeconomic groups, underserved rural populations, and sexual and gender minorities (sgms). comparison groups/populations may also be included as appropriate for the research questions posed. nimhd encourages projects that use approaches encompassing multiple domains of influence (e.g., biological, behavioral, sociocultural, environmental, physical environment, health system) and multiple levels of influence (e.g., individual, interpersonal, family, peer group, community, societal) to understand and address health disparities (see the nimhd research framework, https://www.nimhd.nih.gov/about/overview/research-framework.html, for more information).nimhd will not support animal studies under this foa.for the purposes of this funding opportunity announcement, we seek to understand the interrelation between social connectedness and social isolation and minority health and health disparities.national institute of neurological disorders and stroke (ninds)ninds supports neurobiological mechanisms underlying the influence of social connection and isolation on the development, progression, and recovery of neurological disorders. some examples include, but are not limited to:national institute of nursing research (ninr)the national institute of nursing research (ninr) supports research that builds the scientific foundation for nursing practice and policy across clinical and community settings, and advances the prevention, detection, and management of disease and disability. drawing on nursing’s holistic perspective, ninr supports observational, intervention, and translational research that integrates factors at multiple levels to identify their role in health, health improvement and health inequities in varied settings including hospitals and clinics, but also people’s homes, schools, workplaces, long-term care facilities, and communities. for this par, ninr is especially interested in in research related to social connectedness/isolation that addresses:• social connectedness barriers and facilitators at multiple levels: interpersonal, institutional, community, and policy• health disparities and health disparity populations• resilience, community support, and other potential factors that may reduce or buffer the impact of social isolation on health outcomes• epigenetic and gene expression correlates of social isolation that may inform interventions• the potential for covid-19 mitigation practices (e.g., social distancing, decreased family and community contact) to further exacerbate the risk for experiencing social isolation and associated poor health outcomessee section
