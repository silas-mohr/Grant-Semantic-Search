information section iv. application and submission information section v. application review information section vi. award administration information section vii. agency contacts section viii. other informationthe food & drug administration’s (fda) center for veterinary medicine’s (cvm) office of minor use & minor species animal drug development (omums) was created after “the minor use and minor species animal health act of 2004” (mums act) was signed into law. the mums act helps make more medications legally available to veterinarians and animal owners to treat minor animal species and minor uses in major animal species (mums drugs). major species of animals are: horses, dogs, cats, cattle, swine, turkeys, and chickens. all other animal species (except humans) are minor species. a minor use is the intended use of a new animal drug in a major species for an indication that occurs infrequently and in only a small number of animals or in limited geographical areas and in only a small number of animals annually in the united states.to determine whether any particular use in a major species is a minor use, the fda has established a specific “small number of animals” for each of the seven major animal species as follows: horses-50,000 annually; dogs-70,000 annually; cats-120,000 annually; cattle-310,000 annually; swine-1,450,000 annually; turkeys-14,000,000 annually; and chickens-72,000,000 annually. additional information about minor use and minor species is available on the fda’s website for omums.the fda is authorized to provide grants for designated new animal drugs to assist in defraying the costs of qualified safety and effectiveness testing that could be used to satisfy the requirements for fda approval of mums-designated drugs. the entity seeking fda approval of the new animal drug under investigation must have opened an investigational new animal drug (inad) file with fda/cvm and must hold a minor use or minor species "designation" granted by fda/cvm/omums for that drug for a specified intended use prior to application submission; the entity requests designation status through a formal request to their inad file.fda/cvm’s office of new animal drug evaluation (onade) must have already concurred with the proposed study protocol.qualified safety and effectiveness testing eligible for funding includes studies that support target animal safety or effectiveness, environmental safety, human food safety, and certain manufacturing studies, as well as the analytical method validation studies described below. the following manufacturing studies, as part of the qualified safety and effectiveness studies, are eligible for funding if fda/cvm/onade has already reviewed and concurred with the study protocol:a separate study to validate an analytical method prior to the conduct of an in-life human food safety study is also eligible for funding, if fda/cvm/onade has already reviewed and concurred with the study protocol.applicants must explain how the proposed study will contribute to fda approval or conditional approval of the product in the application’s “significance” section of the research strategy (phs 398 research plan).all funded studies are subject to the requirements of the federal food, drug and cosmetic act (21 u.s.c. 331 et seq.), regulations issued under it, and applicable department of health and human services (hhs) statutes and regulations.see section viii. other information for award authorities and regulations.grant: a support mechanism providing money, property, or both to an eligible entity to carry out an approved project or activity.newthe oer glossary and the sf424 (r&r) application guide provide details on these application types. only those application types listed here are allowed for this nofo.the number of awards is contingent upon fda appropriations and the submission of a sufficient number of meritorious applications. award(s) will provide one (1) year of support and include future recommended support for 2 additional years contingent upon annual appropriations, availability of funding and satisfactory awardee performance.fda/cvm intends to fund up to $500,000 yearly for fiscal year (fy) 2022, fy2023 and fy2024 in support of this grant program.it is anticipated that up to 6 awards will be made per fy, not to exceed $250,000 in total costs (direct plus indirect), per award.the nature and scope of the proposed research will vary from application to application; it is anticipated that the size and duration of each award will also vary. although the financial plans of the fda are to provide support for this program, awards pursuant to this funding opportunity are contingent upon the availability of funds.fda grants policies as described in the hhs grants policy statement will apply to the applications submitted and awards made in response to this nofo.application budgets need to reflect the actual needs of the proposed project and should not exceed the following in total costs (direct and indirect):yr 01: $250,000yr 02: $250,000yr 03: $250,000 (long term toxicological study only)the scope of the proposed project should determine the project period. the length of support of award project periods will depend on the nature of the study but is one-year from date of award for most studies. applicants should explain in the budget justification if more than one-year of support is needed. those studies with an expected duration of more than one year, a second, or in some cases, a third year of noncompetitive continuation of support will depend on the following factors:(1) performance during the preceding year,(2) compliance with the regulatory requirements of an investigational new animal drug file (inad) and those associated with designation, and(3) availability of federal funds.the maximum project period is 3 years.hhs grants policies as described in the hhs grants policy statement will apply to the applications submitted and awards made from this nofo.higher education institutionsthe following types of higher education institutions are always encouraged to apply for fda support as public or private institutions of higher

application but prior to objective review. they are not intended to correct oversights or errors discovered after submission of the application. fda accepts limited information between the time of initial submission of the application and the time of objective review. applicants must contact the assigned grants management specialist to receive approval, prior to submitting any post submission materials. acceptance and/or rejection of any post submission materials is at the sole discretion of the fda. any inquiries regarding post submission materials should be directed to the assigned grants management specialist.only the review criteria described below will be considered in the review process.reviewers will consider each of the review criteria below in the determination of scientific merit.does the proposed study address an aspect of new animal drug safety or effectiveness that will substantially contribute to the fda approval or conditional approval of the designated drug product?are the pd(s)/pi(s), collaborators, and other researchers well suited to the project? do they have appropriate experience and training? if established, have they demonstrated an ongoing record of accomplishments that have advanced their field(s)? if the project is collaborative or multi-pd/pi, do the investigators have complementary and integrated expertise; are their leadership approach, governance and organizational structure appropriate for the project?is the overall strategy, methodology, and analyses well-reasoned and appropriate to accomplish the specific aims of the project? does the application adequately describe the rationale, design, facilities, proposed conduct, proposed evaluation, and justification for financial support of the proposed study, including the ability of the applicant to complete the proposed study within the proposed budget and time limits? does the applicant acknowledge potential problem areas and consider alternative strategies?will the scientific environment in which the work will be done contribute to the probability of success? are the institutional support, equipment and other physical resources available to the investigators adequate for the project proposed? will the project benefit from unique features of the scientific environment, subject populations, or collaborative arrangements?is the requested budget and duration reasonable relative to the proposed research? does the budget adequately describe the costs associated with meeting the aims of the project? are senior/key persons and other required personnel identified in the budget? is the level of effort for senior/key personnel adequate to conduct the aims of the project? are consultants identified and their service costs adequately described in the attached budget justification? if the budget includes subaward/consortium costs, are those costs sufficiently detailed?reviewers will consider whether the budget and the requested period of support are fully justified and reasonable in relation to the proposed research.as applicable for the project proposed, reviewers will evaluate the following additional items but will not give separate scores for these items, and should not consider them in providing an overall score.for research that involves human subjects but does not involve one of the categories of research that are exempt under 45 cfr part 46, the committee will evaluate the justification for involvement of human subjects and the proposed protections from research risk relating to their participation according to the following five review criteria: 1) risk to subjects, 2) adequacy of protection against risks, 3) potential benefits to the subjects and others, 4) importance of the knowledge to be gained, and 5) data and safety monitoring for clinical trials.for research that involves human subjects and meets the criteria for one or more of the categories of research that are exempt under 45 cfr part 46, the committee will evaluate: 1) the justification for the exemption, 2) human subjects involvement and characteristics, and 3) sources of materials. for additional information on review of the human subjects section, please refer to the guidelines for the review of human subjects.inclusion of women, minorities, and individuals across the lifespanwhen the proposed project involves human subjects and/or clinical research, the committee will evaluate the proposed plans for the inclusion (or exclusion) of individuals on the basis of sex/gender, race, and ethnicity, as well as the inclusion (or exclusion) of individuals of all ages (including children and older adults) to determine if it is justified in terms of the scientific goals and research strategy proposed. for additional information on review of the inclusion section, please refer to the guidelines for the review of inclusion in clinical research.the committee will evaluate the involvement of live vertebrate animals as part of the scientific assessment according to the following criteria: (1) description of proposed procedures involving animals, including species, strains, ages, sex, and total number to be used; (2) justifications for the use of animals versus alternative models and for the appropriateness of the species proposed; (3) interventions to minimize discomfort, distress, pain and injury; and (4) justification for euthanasia method if not consistent with the avma guidelines for the euthanasia of animals. reviewers will assess the use of chimpanzees as they would any other application proposing the use of vertebrate animals. for additional information on review of the vertebrate animals section, please refer to the worksheet for review of the vertebrate animal section.reviewers will assess whether materials or procedures proposed are potentially hazardous to research personnel and/or the environment, and if needed, determine whether adequate protection is proposed.not applicablenot

data sharing plan (gds).for projects involving key biological and/or chemical resources, reviewers will comment on the brief plans proposed for identifying and ensuring the validity of those resources.applications will be evaluated for scientific and technical merit by (an) appropriate objective review committee, using the stated review criteria.as part of the objective review, all applications:appeals of objective review will not be accepted for applications submitted in response to this nofo.applications will compete for available funds with all other recommended applications submitted in response to this nofo. the following will be considered in making funding decisions:successful applicants will be notified of additional information that may be required or other actions leading to an award. the decision not to award a grant, or to award a grant at a particular funding level, is discretionary and is not subject to appeal to any fda or hhs official or board.a formal notification in the form of a notice of award (noa) will be provided to the applicant organization for successful applications. the noa signed by the grants management officer is the authorizing document and will be sent via email to the recipient's business official.awardees must comply with any funding restrictions described in section iv.5. funding restrictions and in the notice of award. selection of an application for award is not an authorization to begin performance. any costs incurred before receipt of the noa are at the recipient's risk. these costs may be reimbursed only to the extent considered allowable pre-award costs.any application awarded in response to this nofo will be subject to terms and conditions found in the hhs grants policy statement, this nofo, and notice of award.all fda grant and cooperative agreement awards include the hhs grants policy statement as part of the noa.recipients of federal financial assistance (ffa) from hhs must administer their programs in compliance with federal civil rights laws that prohibit discrimination on the basis of race, color, national origin, disability, age and, in some circumstances, religion, conscience, and sex. this includes ensuring programs are accessible to persons with limited english proficiency. the hhs office for civil rights provides guidance on complying with civil rights laws enforced by hhs. please see https://www.hhs.gov/civil-rights/for-providers/provider-obligations/index.html and http://www.hhs.gov/ocr/civilrights/understanding/section1557/index.html.hhs recognizes that research projects are often limited in scope for many reasons that are nondiscriminatory, such as the principal investigator’s scientific interest, funding limitations, recruitment requirements, and other considerations. thus, criteria in research protocols that target or exclude certain populations are warranted where nondiscriminatory justifications establish that such criteria are appropriate with respect to the health or safety of the subjects, the scientific study design, or the purpose of the research. for additional guidance regarding how the provisions apply to fda grant programs, please contact the scientific/research contact that is identified in section vii under agency contacts of this nofo.please contact the hhs office for civil rights for more information about obligations and prohibitions

872 of the duncan hunter national defense authorization act of fiscal year 2009 (public law 110-417), fda awards will be subject to the federal awardee performance and integrity information system (fapiis) requirements. fapiis requires federal award making officials to review and consider information about an applicant in the designated integrity and performance system (currently fapiis) prior to making an award. an applicant, at its option, may review information in the designated integrity and performance systems accessible through fapiis and comment on any information about itself that a federal agency previously entered and is currently in fapiis. the federal awarding agency will consider any comments by the applicant, in addition to other information in fapiis, in making a judgement about the applicant’s integrity, business ethics, and record of performance under federal awards when completing the review of risk posed by applicants as described in 45 cfr part 75.205 “federal awarding agency review of risk posed by applicants.” this provision will apply to all fda grants and cooperative agreements.fda considers the sharing of research resources developed through fda-sponsored research an important means to enhance the value and further the advancement of research. when research resources have been developed with fda funds and the associated research findings published, those findings must be made readily available to the scientific community.upon acceptance for publication, scientific researchers must submit the author’s final manuscript of the peer-reviewed scientific publication resulting from research supported in whole or in part with fda funds to the nih national library of medicine's (nlm) pubmed central (pmc). fda defines the author's final manuscript as the final version accepted for journal publication, which includes all modifications from the publishing peer review process. the pmc archive is the designated repository for these manuscripts for use by the public, health care providers, educators, scientists, and fda. please see the fda public access policy.additional terms and conditions regarding fda regulatory and cvm/omums programmatic requirements may be part of the notice of award.reporting requirements:all fda grants require both financial and performance reporting.financial reporting:a. cash transaction reportsthe federal financial report (ffr) has a dedicated section to report federal cash receipts and disbursements. for recipients, this information must be submitted quarterly directly to the payment management system (pms) using the web-based tool. quarterly reports are due 30 days following the end of each calendar quarter. the reporting period for this report continues to be based on the
