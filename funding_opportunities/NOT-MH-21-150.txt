3) must currently be in good standing in an accreditation council for graduate medical education accredited residency program or in good standing in a clinical fellowship program; 4) must be able to commit appropriate effort to the proposed research experience in any year; and 5) must not currently have support to obtain research experience from either federal or non-federal funds. candidates during residency must commit no less than 1.8 person-months (15% of full-time professional effort) to the proposed research experience; at the time of award, such candidates must be in postgraduate year 2 of residency or beyond. candidates during fellowship must commit no less than 6 person-months (50% of full-time professional effort) to the proposed research experience.md/phd candidates from underrepresented racial and ethnic groups as well as those with disabilities are always encouraged to apply for nih support.budgetonly include funds requested for the additional supplement activities. the nimh will provide salary support for the candidate in addition to other justified expenses, such as travel and supplies, to enable the candidate to participate fully in the proposed research experience. the requested salary and fringe benefits must be in accordance with the salary structure of the grantee institution for individuals in comparable positions, consistent with the level of effort, and may generally not exceed $75,000 per year. funds up to $5,000 annually may be requested for justified expenses (e.g., research supplies, technical support, and travel) for residents who are committing less than 50% effort in a given ost raduate ear. in years where candidate residents commit 50% or more effort to the supplement, up to $10,000 annually may be requested. funds up to $15,000 annually may be requested during the clinical fellowship. no supplement funds may be used to purchase equipment. the amount requested should reflect the candidate's level of effort and should be well justified.administrative supplements must support work within the scope of the original project. all applicants are encouraged to discuss potential requests with the nimh prior to submission (see section vii. agency contacts).description of circumstances for which administrative supplements are available.application and submission informationrefer to the eligibility and budget information above.applications for this initiative must be submitted using the following opportunity or its subsequent reissued equivalent.all instructions in the sf424 (r&r) application guide and pa-20-272 must be followed, with the following additions:please direct all inquiries to:mark chavez, phd national institute of mental health (nimh) telephone: 301-443-8942 email: mchavez1@nimh.nih.gov weekly toc for this announcement nih funding opportunities and noticesnote: for help accessing pdf, rtf, ms word, excel, powerpoint, audio or video files, see help downloading files.
