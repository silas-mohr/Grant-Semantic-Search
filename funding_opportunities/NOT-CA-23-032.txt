february 17, 2023pa-20-272 - administrative supplements to existing nih grants and cooperative agreements (parent admin supp clinical trial optional)national cancer institute (nci)this notice of special interest (nosi) describes an opportunity for supplemental funding to current grantees for studies that include sexual and gender minority (sgm) populations in cancer control research to enhance or accelerate the understanding of cancer-related health behaviors, care delivery, or health outcomes specific to the sgm population. the goal of this initiative is to supplement existing awards to collect new data and/or analyze existing data through inclusion of and/or outreach to sgm individuals.sexual and gender minority (sgm) people (including but not limited to, lesbian, gay, bisexual, asexual transgender, intersex, and non-binary people) are an underserved, understudied population. sgm populations have unique social, behavioral, and healthcare concerns that put them at greater risk of poor health outcomes, particularly with respect to cancer. for example, avoidance of medical care due to medical mistrust and experiences of discrimination in healthcare settings leads to reduced uptake of cancer screening, particularly among transgender individuals. sgm individuals diagnosed with cancer may be less likely to adhere to treatment regimens for the same reason. interventions to address modifiable cancer risk factors such as poor diet, insufficient physical activity, and tobacco and alcohol use are rarely designed to meet the needs of various sgm sub-groups. inadequate sample sizes create a major barrier to better understanding and addressing challenges faced by sgm people relative to cancer risks and outcomes.the research objective of this nosi is to promote the inclusion of sgm individuals in cancer control research, to enhance or accelerate understanding of cancer-related health behaviors, care delivery, or health outcomes of that result in poor cancer outcomes in the sgm populations. studies are expected to expand participation through sgm-specific outreach or the addition of sexual orientation and gender identity (sogi) measurement, and/or to add sgm-relevant analyses that complement existing aims.specific topics of interest include, but are not limited to:proposals must include sustainability plans to ensure the continued use of sogi measures and sgm recruitment strategies in current and future work, as well as dissemination plans to allow sharing of best practices with the cancer research community. the long-term goal is to support the foundation for the development of interventions to reduce cancer disparities in sgm populations.applications for this initiative must be submitted using the following opportunity or its subsequent reissued equivalent.all instructions in the sf424 (r&r) application guide and pa-20-272 must be followed, with the following additions:eligibility and eligible individuals (program director/principal investigator)budgetrequestspage limits â€“ these sections have the following limits:review and selection processnci program staff will evaluate applications, taking into consideration the following factors:applicants are strongly encouraged to discuss their application with the scientific/research contact listed below prior to submission to ensure responsiveness and facilitate processing of the application.please direct all inquiries to:scientific/research contact(s)chipper dean, phdnational cancer institute (nci)telephone: 240-276-7803email: chipper.dean@nih.govfinancial/grants management contact(s)dawn mitchumnational cancer institute (nci)telephone: 240-276-5699email: dawn.mitchum@nih.govweekly toc for this announcement nih funding opportunities and noticesnote: for help accessing pdf, rtf, ms word, excel, powerpoint, audio or video files, see help downloading files.
