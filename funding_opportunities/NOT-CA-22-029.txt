differences in the access to and delivery of survivorship care, healthcare utilization, and health outcomes have been observed based on factors such as race/ethnicity, insurance status, rural place of residency, and biological sex.the recent agency for healthcare research and quality technical brief number 39, “disparities and barriers to pediatric cancer care,” examined observational and interventional research focused on disparities in survivorship care, healthcare utilization, and health outcomes. the report noted a small number of studies that identified individual-level factors that may contribute to observed disparities in care and outcomes, including financial or employment status, language, literacy, and trust in providers. at the provider level, knowledge, or comfort in the ability to provide care, and the availability of non-medical resources (e.g., transportation) were the most studied factors. there was a paucity of studies focused on the health system and payer levels. furthermore, very few studies were identified that examined the impact of strategies or interventions designed to address disparities in survivorship care.to appropriately assess the full spectrum of factors that may contribute to disparities in survivorship care, it is necessary to examine multiple levels of influence that extend beyond the individual (patient/survivor, caregiver, clinician), to include healthcare teams, healthcare system, community, payer, and policy levels.research objectivesnci is interested in studies that will advance the scientific understanding of factors that may contribute to disparities in survivorship care, healthcare utilization, and health outcomes among childhood cancer survivors, as well as studies to develop, test, refine, and implement strategies to mitigate these disparities. of specific interest are studies of factors operating at two or more of the following levels: individual, healthcare teams, healthcare system, community, payer, and policy.applications in response to this notice may propose observational or interventional research related to childhood cancer survivors. observational studies can be proposed to identify or characterize factors that perpetuate disparities; interventional studies can be proposed to design and evaluate interventions to mitigate factors that contribute to disparities. all applications should consider outcomes in one or more of these domains: care delivery, healthcare utilization, or health outcomes.as part of the proposed research, investigators should specify a framework that guided the selection of study variables and intervention strategies (in the case of interventional research). investigators may consider the use of hybrid implementation/effectiveness study designs if justified. potential study settings of interest include primary care, community cancer centers, academic medical centers, and community health centers.the long-term goal of this nosi is to generate research that promotes equitable, high-quality care and health outcomes for all childhood cancer survivors.responsivenessapplicants submitting in response to this nosi must:research encouraged through this notice includes (but is not limited to) studies that propose to:investigators are encouraged to discuss their application with the scientific/research contacts listed in this notice prior to submission.application and submission informationthis notice applies to due dates on or after march 7, 2022, and subsequent receipt dates through october 9, 2024.submit applications for this initiative using one of the following funding opportunity announcements (foas) or any reissues of these announcement through the expiration date of this notice.activity codefoa titlenext available due datepar-21-190modular r01s in cancer control and population sciences (r01 clinical trial optionalmarch 07, 2022par-21-035cancer prevention and control clinical trials grant program (r01 clinical trial required)june 05, 2022pa-20-183nih research project grant (parent r01 clinical trial required)june 05, 2022pa-20-185nih research project grant (parent r01 clinical trial not allowed)june 05, 2022par-21-038stephen i. katz early stage investigator research project grant (clinical trial not allowed)may 26, 2022par-21-341exploratory grants in cancer control (r21 clinical trial optional)june 07, 2022pa-20-195nih exploratory/developmental research grant program (parent r21 clinical trial not allowed)june 16, 2022pa-20-194nih exploratory/developmental research grant program (parent r21 clinical trial required)june 16, 2022par-20-052nci small grants program for cancer research for years 2020, 2021, and 2022 (nci omnibus r03 clinical trial optional)june 24, 2022pa-20-200nih small research grant program (parent r03 clinical trial not allowed)june 16, 2022par-20-077national cancer institute program project applications (p01 clinical trial optional)may 25, 2022all instructions in the sf424 (r&r) application guide and the funding opportunity announcement used for submission must be followed, with the following additions:eligibility and eligible individuals (program director/principal investigator): eligibility criteria are per the guidelines in the corresponding foa.budget: budget guidelines are per instructions in the corresponding foa.applicants are strongly encouraged to notify the nci program contact via email (cholletv@mail.nih.gov) that a request has been submitted in response to this nosi to facilitate efficient processing of the request.applications nonresponsive to terms of this nosi will be withdrawn from consideration for this initiative.veronica chollette, rn, ms national cancer institute (nci) telephone: (240) 276-6969 email: cholletv@mail.nih.govemily tonorezos, md, mph national cancer institute (nci) telephone: (240) 276-6942 email: emily.tonorezos@nih.govpeer review contact(s)examine your era commons account for review assignment and contact information (information appears two weeks after the submission due date).financial/grants management contact(s)crystal wolfrey national cancer institute (nci) telephone: 240-276-6277 email: wolfreyc@mail.nih.govweekly toc for this announcement nih funding opportunities and noticesnote: for help accessing pdf, rtf, ms word, excel, powerpoint, audio or video files, see help downloading files.
