to all requirements (both in the application guide and the foa) is required and strictly enforced. applicants must read and follow all application instructions in the application guide as well as any program-specific instructions noted in section iv. when the program-specific instructions deviate from those in the application guide, follow the program-specific instructions.applications that do not comply with these instructions may be delayed or not accepted for review.there are several options available to submit your application through grants.gov to nih and department of health and human services partners. you must use one of these submission options to access the application forms for this opportunity.testing strategies to improve prevention and treatment of disease typically requires conducting large clinical trials to ensure efficacy and safety of the proposed intervention. the first step in developing a clinical trial is often exploratory, short-term work to begin to investigate new ideas. the regulatory and financial burden of obtaining preliminary data as part of a pilot study for a large clinical trial can narrow the trial pipeline prematurely and inhibit innovation. this foa invites submission of pilot and feasibility clinical trials conducted in humans that will lay the foundation for larger clinical trials related to the prevention and/or treatment of diseases within the mission of niddk. the program will support small, short-term clinical trials in humans to acquire preliminary data regarding the effects of the intervention, as well as feasibility data related to recruitment and retention, and study conduct. the long-term objective of this foa is to accelerate the initiation of clinical trials to understand, prevent and/or treat diseases and conditions within the mission of niddk by facilitating smaller studies that do not have a stringent requirement for preliminary data in order to investigate new ideas for future clinical trials.niddk is committed to improving the health of people with diabetes and other endocrine and metabolic diseases; digestive diseases, nutritional disorders, and obesity; and kidney, urologic and hematologic diseases. this foa will support 3-year r01s for pilot and feasibility clinical trials where there is evidence supporting the scientific premise and sufficient justification of operational feasibility to conduct a pilot. there should be data from the pd/pi or from the literature to support the premise and rationale for the trial. there should be evidence that the pd/pi or co-investigators have the requisite knowledge, skills and experience to conduct the trial. however, preliminary data, particularly regarding intervention efficacy, a?r?e not required. applications for clinical trials submitted under this foa should have the potential to lead to a definitive trial that would be hypothesis-driven; the pilot trial should have clearly described aims and objectives. in general, the goal of these pilot studies would be to acquire data to support the rationale, design and/or feasibility of a definitive study. although some formative work may be appropriate, the purpose of this foa is to support pilot and feasibility testing of the proposed intervention and not for intervention development. the expectation would be that the proposed clinical trial, if successful, would lead to an application to support a larger, fully powered trial affecting important health outcomes. these definitive studies should improve understanding, diagnosis, prevention or treatment of the diseases or conditions studied and have the potential to impact clinical practice and/or public health.nih defines a clinical trial as “a research study in which one or more human subjects are prospectively assigned to one or more interventions (which may include placebo or other control) to evaluate the effects of those interventions on health-related biomedical or behavioral outcomes" (https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/not-od-15-015.html). applications submitted to this foa may propose either therapeutic or mechanistic clinical trials (including basic experimental studies with humans (besh)). a therapeutic trial has a goal of determining clinical safety, tolerability, efficacy and/or effectiveness of an intervention designed to prevent or treat a disease or condition. such studies may be pragmatic trials where the intervention is tested under the usual conditions in which it will be applied, or explanatory trials where the intervention is tested under idealized circumstances. mechanistic trials are designed to understand a biologic process, the pathophysiology of a disease, or the mechanism of action of an intervention.many of the diseases or conditions within the mission of niddk disproportionately affect individuals from racial and ethnic minorities. niddk encourages research focusing on minority and underserved populations and places a high priority on clinical trials to understand and eliminate health disparities.this foa is not intended for observational studies.only clinical trials to be conducted with one or two distinct clinical research centers will be supported under this announcement. t?r?i?a?l?s ?i?n?v?o?l?v?i?n?g? ?t?h?r?e?e? ?o?r? ?m?o?r?e? ?c?e?n?t?e?r?s are not appropriate to this foa and will not be supported. for the purpose of this foa, a clinical research center may encompass one or more physical locations where the clinical trial is being conducted -- i.e., where study participants are recruited, and/or are intervened upon and/or have outcomes assessed under a single protocol – as long as all locations are under the overall direction of a single investigator. a data coordinating center is not considered a clinical research center. applications for clinical trials requiring three or more centers should be submitted to niddk multi-center clinical study implementation planning cooperative agreement (u34) and niddk multi-center clinical study cooperative agreement (u01) foas, as explained in notice dk-14-025 (see http://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/not-dk-14-025.html) or other foas that allow multi-center studies.this foa will only support research within the mission of niddk. research applications in areas that are primarily within the missions of other nih institutes and centers are not appropriate for this foa and will not be supported. niddk has many research areas within its mission, but all research related to relevant diseases may not be appropriate for niddk. applicants to this foa are strongly encouraged to contact niddk staff as soon as possible in the development of the application, so that niddk staff can help the applicant understand whether the proposed clinical trial is within the goals and mission of the institute and is appropriate for this foa.the following information about research within the mission of niddk is meant to provide examples and does not represent an exhaustive list. in brief, niddk has a major interest in diabetes and its complications, but research on most organ-specific diabetes complications, with the exception of diabetic nephropathy and diabetic foot ulcers, is within the mission of other nih ics. for example, niddk does not support research on diabetic retinopathy or cardiovascular disease. research on endocrine cancers should not be submitted to niddk. niddk does not support research focusing on the primary prevention or treatment of gestational diabetes directed at the immediate pregnancy outcomes of women or their newborns. reproductive endocrinology is not within the mission of niddk and studies on this topic will not be supported under this announcement.niddk has a major interest in obesity research, but research on obesity-related endpoints outside of the mission of niddk should not be submitted to this foa. examples of obesity-related research not within the mission of niddk include: research on the pathogenesis, prevention, or treatment of obesity-related cardiovascular disease, hypertension, asthma, or heart failure; research on obesity-related musculoskeletal disorders ; research with a primary aim of investigating the impact of obesity on neurocognitive function ; and research on use and abuse of alcohol after bariatric surgery. niddk is interested in nutrition clinical trials that aim to treat diseases within the mission of niddk or improve health.niddk is interested in clinical trials with translational potential and clinically meaningful endpoints for diseases of the alimentary tract, liver, and pancreas. niddk does not support cancer trials.niddk is also interested in supporting clinical trials leading to the identification and evaluation of possible treatments to prevent the development and progression of kidney diseases and benign genitourinary diseases and conditions. trials focused solely on non-renal outcomes and endpoints in populations with kidney disease are not supported under this announcement. this foa does not support transplantation trials focused on processes and mechanisms of acute rejection of kidneys, or on immune-mediated diseases, where the kidney is not the focus of the investigation. trials involving malignant diseases of the kidney and g?e?n?i?t?o?u?r?i?n?a?r?y organs should not be submitted to niddk. niddk does not support trials involving hematologic disorders.applications proposing any animal or in vitro studies are not appropriate f?o?r this foa.applicants are reminded of the nih policy on the use of a single institutional review board for multi-center clinical trials (see https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/not-od-18-004.html ) as well as the nih policy on the registration and reporting of the results of clinical trials (https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/not-od-16-149.html ).grant: a support mechanism providing money, property, or both to an eligible entity to carry out an approved project or activity.resubmissions - only applications originally submitted to this foa are allowed.the oer glossary and the sf424 (r&r) application guide provide details on these application types. only those

management and sharing plan. all applications, regardless of the amount of direct costs requested for any one year, must address a data management and sharing plan.specific aims: in this section, the applicant should note that the submission is in response to pas-20-160 , small r01s for clinical trials targeting diseases within the mission of niddk, which does not require preliminary data.research strategy: the applicant should clearly articulate the significance of the proposed study including why the clinical trial is needed, and what evidence gap the trial will address (including a discussion of why there is clinical equipoise). investigators should clearly articulate why the long-term goal of the study is of high clinical significance and how data obtained in the pilot and feasibility trial will be used in a future clinical trial to improve health outcomes – i.e., a hypothesis-driven "next step" should be proposed.although direct preliminary data are not required, any discussion of supporting data that provide the basis for the trial must address the adequacy and quality of previous studies.the application should include a detailed description and scientific rationale for the study design, addressing the intervention chosen, the population to be studied and the outcomes being assessed. there must be clear feasibility objectives and clear criteria for how feasibility will be assessed and judged to be successful.the application should address the feasibility of the proposed clinical trial including the available resources, access to the relevant population, and expertise in conducting human subjects research within the investigative team.the following modifications also apply:if you answered “yes” to the question “are human subjects involved?” on the r&r other project information form, you must include at least one human subjects study record using the study record: phs human subjects and clinical trials information form or delayed onset study record.study record: phs human subjects and clinical trials informationall instructions in the sf424 (r&r) application guide must be followed.section 2 - study population characteristics2.5 recruitment and retention plan: please include a discussion of the availability of potential participants for the proposed study and anticipated yield from recruitment and screening efforts. if there is more than one recruitment site, please provide a table showing the expected number and demographics of the population to be recruited at each site and overall. the plan should

timepoints when an outcome measure will be collected.4.4 statistical design and power: pilot and feasibility trials are, by definition, not fully powered to answer a question. the investigator should provide a rationale for the number of participants who will be studied. if a full power calculation is provided, the sample size and statistical power calculations should contain enough detail, including assumptions made, so that a reviewer can readily duplicate the sample size. the application should include a discussion of the anticipated level of adherence to the intervention and rates of follow-up (i.e., drop out/lost to follow up) during key outcome collection contacts. a discussion of how missing data will be handled should be included. any planned interim analyses should also be described.section 5 - other clinical trial-related attachments5.1 other clinical trial-related attachments:the filename "milestone plan.pdf" must be used for this attachment. please amend the file name when more than one attachment with the same file name would be possible (e.g., ‘milestone plan.1’ for study record 1, ‘milestone plan.2’ for study record 2, etc.).applicants are required to provide detailed interim performance measures and timelines for completing key objectives and administrative functions for the proposed clinical trial(s), as applicable. milestones should be easily measurable and realistic. the milestone plan is not the same as the study timeline (section 2.7). milestones may include, as applicable, but are not limited to:these milestones will be negotiated at the time of the award, as appropriate. future year support is contingent on satisfactory achievement of performance milestones. if milestones are not achieved fully, niddk may request development of a remedial plan and more frequent monitoring of progress, or take other remedial actions.note: delayed onset does not apply to a study that can be described but will not start immediately (i.e., delayed start).all instructions in the sf424 (r&r) application guide must be followed.see part 1. section iii.1 for information regarding the requirement for obtaining a unique entity identifier and for

applications that are incomplete or non-compliant will not be reviewed.use of common data elements in nih-funded researchmany nih ics encourage the use of common data elements (cdes) in basic, clinical, and applied research, patient registries, and other human subject research to facilitate broader and more effective use of data and advance research across studies. cdes are data elements that have been identified and defined for use in multiple data sets across different studies. use of cdes can facilitate data sharing and standardization to improve data quality and enable data integration from multiple studies and sources, including electronic health records. nih ics have identified cdes for many clinical domains (e.g., neurological disease), types of studies (e.g. genome-wide association studies (gwas)), types of outcomes (e.g., patient-reported outcomes), and patient registries (e.g., the global rare diseases patient registry and data repository). nih has established a “common data element (cde) resource portal" (http://cde.nih.gov/) to assist investigators in identifying nih-supported cdes when developing protocols, case report forms, and other instruments for data collection. the portal provides guidance about and access to nih-supported cde initiatives and other tools and resources for the appropriate use of cdes and data standards in nih-funded research. investigators are encouraged to consult the portal and describe in their applications any use they will make of nih-supported cdes in their projects.note: effective for due dates on or after january 25, 2023, the data sharing plan and genomic data sharing plan (gds) as part of the resource sharing plan will not be evaluated at time of review.only the review criteria described
