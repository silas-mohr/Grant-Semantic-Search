b) development of computational tools or software for analyzing, visualizing and integrating bbqs-related data, and for predicting and modeling the complex dynamics of the brain-behavior system; and c) establishment of data standards or ontologies that support the bbqs-related studies.backgroundthe brain research through advancing innovative neurotechnologies® (brain) initiative has recently launched the brain behavior quantification and synchronization (bbqs) research program. the program seeks to support the development and validation of next-gen tools, methods, and analytic approaches to precisely quantify complex behaviors and combine them with simultaneous recordings of brain activity for understanding of the complex dynamics of the brain-behavior system. the program is expected to generate large amounts of multi-modality data from multiple species, including humans. this may include videographic, audiographic, electrophysiologic, temperature and other continuous data. some projects are also expected to generate data related to ambulation, limb movements, facial movements, eye movements, vocalizations, glandular secretion, and peripheral physiology. these data sets and related metadata are expected to be large and measured across multiple timescales.one major challenge of the program lies in archiving and sharing these data with the community as required by both the brain initiative and nih policies (not-mh-19-010, not-od-21-013). currently, there is no public data repository available from the brain initiative or other sources that are suitable for archiving and managing the bbqs-related data. to build a domain-specific archive for the bbqs-related data will be important for not only storing and sharing this domain of data, but also building a cloud-based and archive-integrated modern data ecosystem for the bbqs research. the bbqs archive is expected to collaborate with existing brain initiative informatics awards, when appropriate. another challenge in the bbqs program is to be able to analyze and interpret the large-scale multimodal data and predict and model the complex dynamics of the brain-behavior system. this requires development and deployment of comprehensive, cutting-edge computational tools or software for data analysis, visualization and integration, as well as for machine learning (ml) and artificial intelligence (ai) to advance the research. an additional challenge in the bbqs program is to be able to ensure that the studies conducted using different technologies or approaches under different circumstances are consistent, and the outcomes are comparable and integrable. it is, therefore, essential for the bbqs consortium to develop and implement a set of common standards for (meta) data collection, description, annotation, organization and analysis. such standards are expected to significantly enhance the interpretability, integrability and fairness of the data within and across the consortium.research objectivesthis goal of this nosi is to support the creation of data archive(s), development of software tools, and establishment of data standards for bbqs studies to address the above-described challenges in the research program. the informatics infrastructure and tools to be developed under this nosi are expected to be widely used by bbqs investigators, as well as by a broader community. applications in response to this nosi should therefore justify the importance and implications of the proposed informatics infrastructure or tools to the bbqs program, and identify the potential user base. the projects supported under this nosi are expected to support, communicate and collaborate with the funded bbqs research projects. applicants should familiarize themselves with the bbqs research program and funded projects (https://www.braininitiative.nih.gov/funding/initiatives.htm; also see rfa-mh-23-335 and rfa-da-23-030).the specific goals of this nosi are:the brain bbqs research program is particularly interested in applications from multi-disciplinary teams that, in addition to expertise in data sciences and informatics, also include diverse expertise in behavioral science, including but not limited to behavioral, cognitive and systems neuroscience, neuroethology, biomechanics, psychology and psychiatry, as well as computational neuroscience.application and submission informationsubmission of an application in response to this nosi should use one of the following foas or any reissues of the foas.foatitledue datesrfa-mh-22-220brain initiative: integration and analysis of brain initiative data (r01 clinical trial not allowed)june 9, 2023;
