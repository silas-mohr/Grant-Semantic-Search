these submission options to access the application forms for this opportunity.purposethrough this funding opportunity announcement (foa), the national cancer institute (nci) invites applications for the research specialist award in any area of nci-funded clinical cancer research. this foa is specifically for clinician scientists to continue to participate in the nci clinical trials networks through leadership in the 1) development of national clinical trials, 2) implementation of nci clinical trials in their institutions, and 3) national service to the nci clinical trials networks through participation in the scientific review committees, monitoring committees, and other activities, but not serve as principal investigators of research project grants. these clinician scientists are vital to sustaining the nci-funded clinical trials enterprise. the research specialist award is intended to provide stable support for clinician scientists at their institutions for significant leadership and exceptional participation in the nci-sponsored clinical trials networks that conduct cancer treatment, prevention and control, and care delivery clinical trials. nci-sponsored clinical trials networks include but are not limited to the national clinical trials network (nctn), the nci community oncology research program (ncorp), the experimental therapeutics clinical trials network (etctn), and the cancer prevention clinical trials network (cp-ctnet). the research specialist award is designed to encourage the development of a career path for cancer clinical trial investigators who provide leadership, participation, and scientific support for the nci clinical trials networks at their institutions and within those networks. this leadership includes the development of concepts and protocols for clinical trials, participation in scientific steering committees and network committees, and accrual to nci-sponsored clinical trials. the institutional activities may include the implementation of cancer clinical trials including participation in the review of safety data, monitoring the conduct and progress of open clinical trials, and serving on institutional review committees. these activities are necessary for the successful conduct of nci-sponsored cancer clinical trials. the research specialist award is intended to provide salary support and sufficient autonomy so that individuals are not solely dependent on nci grants held by others or other sources of funding for cancer research career continuity.backgroundthe research specialist (clinician scientist) award is intended to provide salary support and sufficient autonomy so that individuals are not solely dependent on nci-funded grants held by others or other sources of support for cancer research career continuity. over the past decade, cancer clinical trials have become more complex in trial design, have a greater number of regulatory issues to address and require significant effort from clinician investigators to review safety data, monitor the progress of multiple ongoing clinical trials, and respond to human subjects concerns that are both expected and unexpected. these efforts are frequently not reimbursed and are neither funded in research project grants nor funded through the nci clinical trials networks. typical research activities include service on institutional clinical research committees (institutional review boards, protocol review and monitoring for scientific prioritization, data safety, and management, disease- or modality-based disease groups, etc.), oversight of multiple clinical trials within a clinical trials office, service on national clinical trials committees (national clinical trials network steering committees, etc.), developing new cancer clinical trials by writing and revising new protocols, recruiting patients to new and existing trials, and satisfying annual training in human subjects protection and regulatory compliance. the need for individuals with the broad research expertise and clinical background required of clinical scientists is rapidly growing. current sources of support for the research activities of clinician scientists are inadequate and compete against the growing demands of clinical duties and responsibilities.scope of this foathe research specialist (clinician scientist) award is intended to provide salary support for a sustained period of time and encourage the development of a stable career for exceptional clinical scientists who provide excellent leadership in the scientific development and implementation of nci-sponsored clinical trials which are conducted through the nci clinical trials networks. the award is intended for clinician scientists with significant, relevant experience, who have shown clear evidence of productivity and research excellence in the implementation of nci-funded clinical trials within their institution. the proposed new research support is intended to provide salaries and sufficient autonomy so that individuals are not solely dependent on nci-funded grants held by others or other sources of support for cancer research career continuity. as the pd/pi, research specialists would have the option, with prior nci approval, to move to other research programs or institutions while maintaining funding from this award.see section viii. other information for award authorities and regulations.grant: a support mechanism providing money, property, or both to an eligible entity to carry out an approved project or
