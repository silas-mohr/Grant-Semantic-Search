accidental death in the us, with an estimation of 100,000 deaths in 2021. deaths involving synthetic opioids other than methadone (primarily fentanyl) continued to rise, with 56,516 overdose deaths reported in 2020. deaths involving psychostimulants with abuse potential (primarily methamphetamine) also continued to increase to 23,837 individuals; and those involving cocaine rose steadily from 5,419 in 2014 to 19,447 in 2020.although there are safe and effective pharmacotherapies for opioid use disorders and to prevent/reverse overdose, their use has some limitation or they are largely underutilized. methadone and buprenorphine are approved by the fda to treat ouds but long term efficacy and treatment adherence are sub-optimal. naltrexone is approved by the fda to prevent opioid use relapse in people with no physical dependence to opioids but initiation and adherence to treatment are low. naloxone is approved to reverse opioid overdose but it has a short action, may precipitate opioid withdrawal, and put the person at risk of overdose. lofexidine is fda-approved for the treatment of opioid withdrawal in adults but it is not approved to treat pregnant women and neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome. unfortunately, there are no fda-approved medications to treat psud or an antidote to treat overdoses due to psychostimulants. therefore, there is an urgent need to develop safe and effective medications to prevent and treat oud and/or psud and overdose.advances in the understanding of oud and psudand overdose provide new opportunities to improve the treatment of these disorders and contribute to reduce the current drug overdose crisis. some of these advances include the new findings of receptors, neurotransmitters, neuromodulators, and brain circuits associated with these disorders, a greater understanding of the endogenous opioid system, and the risk and protective factors for the onset and progression of these disorders. new targets and medications, new formulations and delivery systems of medications may be ready to be evaluated. better understanding of pain mechanisms has revolutionized our understanding of addiction and pain and new, non-addictive pain medicines are urgently needed to prevent the initiation or progression of ouds and prevent overdoses. furthermore, advances in the development of biologics can offer an opportunity to investigate vaccines and monoclonal antibodies for the prevention or treatment of oud and/or psud,and drug overdose. therefore, multiple therapeutic approaches may be poised for the next step in the fda approval process and concerted efforts are needed to advance these potential pharmacotherapies to approval.research focusnida seeks preclinical and clinical research studies that will have high impact and quickly yield the necessary results to advance closer to fda approval, medications that are safe and effective to prevent and treat oud and/or psud, and overdose.applications should focus on studying new chemical entities (nces), medications already marketed for other indications, biologics (e.g., vaccines, monoclonal antibodies) or combination of medications.there is particular interest in the development of compounds for indications such as:the following types of applications will not be considered responsive and will be withdrawn without review:milestonesbecause the development of medications is likely to be high risk, grant applications should provide clear milestones to be accomplished at the end of the ug3. it is anticipated that there will be attrition of some projects that do not meet the of milestones the ug3. objective milestones of success and go/no-go rules for medications development progression will be required, and both should have quantitative criteria associated with them.some examples of milestones include:hit identifiedcompound(s) identified, and confirmed, with at least micromolar affinity for the target and some selectivity vs. counter targetslead identifiedchemical structure identified that can serve as a starting point for sar to improve potency, selectivity, and/or pharmacokinetic parameterscandidate identifiedsingle compound

council on drug abuse recommended guidelines for the administration of drugs to human subjects:the national advisory council on drug abuse (nacda) recognizes the importance of research involving the administration of drugs with abuse potential, and dependence or addiction liability, to human subjects. potential applicants are encouraged to obtain and review these recommendations of council before submitting an application that will administer compounds to human subjects. the guidelines are available on nida's web site at http://www.nida.nih.gov/about/organization/nacda/councilstatement.html.points to consider regarding tobacco industry funding of nida applicants:the national advisory council on drug abuse (nacda) encourages nida and its grantees to consider the points it has set forth with regard to existing or prospective sponsored research agreements with tobacco companies or their related entities and the impact of acceptance of tobacco industry funding on nida's credibility and reputation within the scientific community. please see (http://ww2.drugabuse.gov/about/organization/nacda/points-to-consider.html) for details.data harmonization for substance abuse and addiction via the phenx toolkit:nida strongly encourages investigators involved in human-subject studies to employ a common set of tools and resources that will promote the collection of comparable data across studies and to do so by incorporating the measures from the core and specialty collections, which are available in the substance abuse and addiction collection of the phenx toolkit (www.phenxtoolkit.org). please see not-da-12-008 (http://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/not-da-12-008.html) for further details.data sharing:nida strongly encourages investigators to share data with other investigators. nida expects that applicants to nida funding opportunity announcements: 1) submit their data to one of the nih data archives for sharing; 2) include specific required elements in the resource sharing plan including a description of whether and how the consents that will be used to obtain that data will affect the research that can be done with that data; and 3) include costs attributed to data preparation and submission to a data archive in grant applications.plan for enhancing diverse perspectives (pedp):nih supports the formation of research teams that represent diverse perspectives, backgrounds and academic and technical disciplines (see not-od-20-031 and not-od-22-019), as well as the submission of research applications from all eligible institutions. in accordance with the nida rei initiative,

notice of award (noa) will be provided to the applicant organization for successful applications. the noa signed by the grants management officer is the authorizing document and will be sent via email to the recipient's business official.recipients must comply with any funding restrictions described in section iv.5. funding restrictions. selection of an application for award is not an authorization to begin performance. any costs incurred before receipt of the noa are at the recipient's risk. these costs may be reimbursed only to the extent considered allowable pre-award costs.any application awarded in response to this foa will be subject to terms and conditions found on the award conditions and information for nih grants website. this includes any recent legislation and policy applicable to awards that is highlighted on this website.individual awards are based on the application submitted to, and as approved by, the nih and are subject to the ic-specific terms and conditions identified in the noa.clinicaltrials.gov: if an award provides for one or more clinical trials. by law (title viii, section 801 of public law 110-85), the "responsible party" must register and submit results information for certain “applicable clinical trials” on the clinicaltrials.gov protocol registration and results system information website (https://register.clinicaltrials.gov). nih expects registration and results reporting of all trials whether required under the law or not. for more information, see https://grants.nih.gov/policy/clinical-trials/reporting/index.htminstitutional review board or independent ethics committee approval: recipient institutions must ensure that all protocols are reviewed by their irb or iec. to help ensure the safety of participants enrolled in nih-funded studies, the recipient must provide nih copies of documents related to all major changes in the status of ongoing protocols.data and safety monitoring requirements: the nih policy for data and safety monitoring requires oversight and monitoring of all nih-conducted or -supported human biomedical and behavioral intervention studies (clinical trials) to ensure the safety of participants and the validity and integrity of the data. further information concerning these requirements is found at http://grants.nih.gov/grants/policy/hs/data_safety.htm and in the application instructions (sf424 (r&r) and phs 398).investigational new drug or investigational device exemption requirements: consistent with federal regulations, clinical research projects involving the use of investigational therapeutics, vaccines, or other medical interventions (including licensed products and devices for a purpose other than that for which they were licensed) in humans under a research protocol must be performed under a food and drug administration (fda) investigational new drug (ind) or investigational device exemption (ide).2. administrative and national policy requirementsall nih grant and cooperative agreement awards include the nih grants policy statement as part of the noa. for these terms of award, see the nih grants policy statement part ii: terms and conditions of nih grant awards, subpart a: general and part ii: terms and conditions of nih grant awards, subpart b: terms and conditions for specific types of grants, recipients, and activities, including of note, but not limited to:if a recipient is successful and receives a notice of award, in accepting the award, the recipient agrees that any activities under the award are subject to all provisions currently in effect or implemented during the period of the award, other department regulations and policies in effect at the time of the award, and applicable statutory provisions.should the applicant organization successfully compete for an award, recipients of federal financial assistance (ffa) from hhs must administer their programs in compliance with federal civil rights laws that prohibit discrimination on the basis of race, color, national origin, disability, age and, in some circumstances, religion, conscience, and sex (including gender identity, sexual orientation, and pregnancy). this includes ensuring programs are accessible to persons with limited english proficiency and persons with disabilities. the hhs office for civil rights provides guidance on complying with civil rights laws enforced by hhs. please see https://www.hhs.gov/civil-rights/for-providers/provider-obligations/index.html and https://www.hhs.gov/civil-rights/for-individuals/nondiscrimination/index.htmlhhs recognizes that research projects are often limited in scope for many reasons that are nondiscriminatory, such as the principal investigator’s scientific interest, funding limitations, recruitment requirements, and other considerations. thus, criteria in research protocols that target or exclude certain populations are warranted where nondiscriminatory justifications establish that such criteria are appropriate with respect to the health or safety of the subjects, the scientific study design, or the purpose of the research. for additional guidance regarding how the provisions apply to nih grant programs, please contact the scientific/research contact that is identified in section vii under agency contacts of this foa.please contact the hhs office for civil rights for more information about obligations and prohibitions under federal civil rights laws at

defense authorization act of fiscal year 2009 (public law 110-417), nih awards will be subject to the federal awardee performance and integrity information system (fapiis) requirements. fapiis requires federal award making officials to review and consider information about an applicant in the designated integrity and performance system (currently fapiis) prior to making an award. an applicant, at its option, may review information in the designated integrity and performance systems accessible through fapiis and comment on any information about itself that a federal agency previously entered and is currently in fapiis. the federal awarding agency will consider any comments by the applicant, in addition to other information in fapiis, in making a judgement about the applicant’s integrity, business ethics, and record of performance under federal awards when completing the review of risk posed by applicants as described in 45 cfr part 75.205 and 2 cfr part 200.206 “federal awarding agency review of risk posed by applicants.” this provision will apply to all nih grants and cooperative agreements except fellowships.the following special terms of award are in addition to, and not in lieu of, otherwise applicable u.s. office of management and budget (omb) administrative guidelines, u.s. department of health and human services (dhhs) grant administration regulations at 45 cfr part 75, and other hhs, phs, and nih grant administration policies.the administrative and funding instrument used for this program will be the cooperative agreement, an "assistance" mechanism (rather than an "acquisition" mechanism), in which substantial nih programmatic involvement with the recipients is anticipated during the performance of the activities. under the cooperative agreement, the nih purpose is to support and stimulate the recipients' activities by involvement in and otherwise working jointly with the award recipients in a partnership role; it is not to assume direction, prime responsibility, or a dominant role in the activities. consistent with this concept, the dominant role and prime responsibility resides with the recipients for the project as a whole, although specific tasks and activities may be shared among the recipients and the nih as defined below.the pd(s)/pi(s) will have the primary responsibility for:all aspects of their study, including any modification of study design, conduct of the study, quality control, data analysis and interpretation, preparation of publications, dissemination of data, tools, and technologies, and collaboration with other investigators.the recipient agrees to accept close coordination, cooperation, and participation of nih staff in those aspects of scientific and technical management of the study including those outlined under "nih responsibilities".award recipients will participate in annual meetings of the recipients and will support any committees, task forces, and advisory panels as needed.upon implementation of the protocol, each field center, whether a single institution or a consortium of institutions, will follow the procedures required by the protocol regarding study conduct and monitoring, patient management, and data collection.support or other involvement of industry or any other third party in the study--e.g., participation by the third party; involvement of project resources or citing the name of the project or the nih support; or special access to project results, data, findings, or resources--may be advantageous and appropriate. however, except for licensing of patents or copyrights, support or involvement of any third party will occur with the concurrence by nih program officer to ensure objectivity of research.award recipients will own the rights in any tangible work products created under the terms of the cooperative agreement. work products may include such things as research reports, papers, research, findings, training curricula, data sets, books, patient tools, and other materials. all such products shall be made accessible to the public and are recipients(s) will retain custody of and have primary rights to the data and software developed under these awards, subject to government policies subject to government policies regarding rights of access dhhs, phs, and nih policies.nih staff have substantial programmatic involvement that is above and beyond the normal stewardship role in awards, as described below:the nih project scientist will have access to the data and work with the pd(s)/pi(s) to ensure the objectives of the program are being met. the primary responsibility for the program resides with the recipents, although specific tasks and activities will be shared among the recipient and the nih project scientist.nih support of this study is contingent upon adequate participant recruitment based on the recipient's milestone accrual plan submitted at the time of funding.the recipient is expected to demonstrate best effort compliance. failure to achieve minimally acceptable milestone recruitment levels may result in the withholding future support and or negotiating an orderly close-out of this study.nih staff will act as a resource and facilitator for activities of the recipient with non-hcs researchers and other nih, dhhs, or other federally-sponsored research networks that may be relevant to this effort.serve as a resource to provide scientific/programmatic support during the accomplishment of the clinical trial by participating in the design of the activities, advising in the selection of sources or resources, advising in management and technical performance, or participating in the preparation of publications.participate in the monitoring of issues relating to recruitment, retention and follow-up of study participants, and monitoring of data integrity and quality control through consideration of the annual reports, site visits, patient logs, etc. this review may include, but is not limited to, compliance with the study protocol, meeting patient enrollment targets, adherence to uniform data collection procedures, and the timeliness and quality of data reporting as needed to the administration and evaluation core.assist in the development and modification of study protocols.nih staff will interact with the pd(s)/pi(s) on a regular basis to monitor progress. monitoring may include: regular communication with the pd(s)/pi(s) and his staff, periodic site visits for discussion with the recipients' research team, observation of field data collection and management techniques, fiscal reviews, and other relevant stewardship matters.additionally, an agency program official or ic program director will be responsible for the normal scientific and programmatic stewardship of the award and will be named in the award notice.areas of joint responsibility include:the pd(s)/pi(s) provide, in concert with the nih staff, support necessary to ensure that sites and investigators, and nih and other research partners fully comply with federal regulatory requirements, including but not limited to those relating to human subjects protections, informed consent, and reporting of adverse events.recipients and nih will jointly develop appropriate confidentiality procedures for data collection, processing, storage and analysis to ensure the confidentiality of data on individual health care provider organization patients, health care providers and other institutions.all recipients and nih will cooperate to ensure the timely and broad dissemination of lessons learned, to inform researchers and health care systems engaged in research in health care settings.dispute resolution:any disagreements that may arise in scientific or programmatic matters (within the scope of the award) between recipients and the nih may be brought to dispute resolution. a dispute resolution panel composed of three members will be convened. it will have three members: a designee of the investigator chosen without nih staff voting from among the pi of the foa, one nih designee, and a third designee with expertise in the relevant area who is chosen by the other two; in the case of individual disagreement, the first member may be chosen by the individual recipient. this special dispute resolution procedure does not alter the recipient's right to appeal an adverse action that is otherwise appealable in accordance with phs regulation 42 cfr part 50, subpart d and dhhs regulation 45 cfr part 16. applicabledata management and sharingnote: the nih policy for data management and sharing is effective for due dates on or after january 25, 2023.consistent with the nih policy for data management and sharing, when data management and sharing is applicable to the award, recipients will be required to adhere to the data management and sharing requirements as outlined in the nih grants policy statement. upon the approval of a data management and sharing plan, it is required for recipients to implement the plan as described.3. reportingwhen multiple years are involved, recipients will be required to submit the research performance progress report (rppr) annually and financial statements as required in the nih grants policy statement.a final rppr, invention statement, and the expenditure data portion of the federal financial report are required for closeout of an award, as described in the nih grants policy statement. nih foas outline intended research goals and objectives. post award, nih will review and measure performance based on the details and outcomes that are shared within the rppr, as described at 45 cfr part 75.301 and 2 cfr part 200.301.the federal funding accountability and transparency act of 2006 (transparency act), includes a requirement for recipients of federal grants to report information about first-tier subawards and executive compensation under federal assistance awards issued in fy2011 or later. all recipients of applicable nih grants and cooperative agreements are required to report to the federal subaward reporting system (fsrs) available at www.fsrs.gov on all subawards over $25,000. see the nih grants policy statement for additional information on this reporting requirement.in accordance with the regulatory requirements provided at 45 cfr 75.113 and appendix xii to 45 cfr part 75, recipients that have currently active federal grants, cooperative agreements, and procurement contracts from all federal awarding agencies with a cumulative total value greater than $10,000,000 for any period of time during the period of performance of a federal award, must report and maintain the currency of information reported in the system for award management (sam) about civil, criminal, and administrative proceedings in connection with the award or performance of a federal award that reached final disposition within the most recent five-year period. the recipient must also make semiannual disclosures regarding such proceedings. proceedings information will be made publicly available in the designated integrity and performance system (currently fapiis). this is a statutory requirement under section 872 of public law 110-417, as amended (41 u.s.c. 2313). as required by section 3010 of public law 111-212, all information posted in the designated integrity and
