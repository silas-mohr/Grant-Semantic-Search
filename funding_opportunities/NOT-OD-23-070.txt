uncertainty about costs associated with specific jobs and use cases in a cloud environment; and uncertainty about which workflows would benefit most from the cloud.research objectivethe goal of this notice of special interest (nosi) is to encourage and enable researchers to explore and test opportunities to enhance their research projects by incorporating cloud capabilities. projects already using cloud may apply to explore and test cloud capabilities not yet leveraged. projects supported through this nosi should result in improved understanding of how to best use cloud resources. specifically, this opportunity is to support proof-of-concept explorations, measurements, or other tests of the suitability and feasibility of using cloud resources to enhance nih-supported research projects. proposed projects should result in a better understanding of which use cases are cost effective or enable significant enhancements to strategic data science goals such as facilitating new discoveries through access to modern computing and storage platforms at scale; broadening and diversifying participation in nih research; facilitating the interoperability of nih data, for example, by enabling multi-cloud or cross-cloud architectures; enhancing existing projects by utilizing new cloud technologies; or improving the computational and cost efficiencies of research. applicants should consider the expertise needed for the proposed work and incorporate new partners, as needed.applications in response to this nosi are strongly encouraged to include the following information:these supplements may be used to support a variety of activities including, but not limited to, the following:awardees should be willing to participate in virtual meetings organized by nih.applications that are not appropriate and out of scope for this nosi include:ico specific considerationsoffice of strategic coordinationthe nih office of strategic coordination (common fund - https://commonfund.nih.gov/) supports multiple transformative research programs that generate new technologies, methods, and data. many of these programs produced rich public data sets containing multi-dimensional molecular and phenotypic data from humans and model organisms. established common fund data sets listed below are well-poised for increased community use:osc is interested in proposals that substantially leverage at least one of the above datasets. substantial leverage is defined as use and citation of the dataset(s) in the envisioned research products of the proposed work (manuscripts, presentations, book chapters, portals, etc.).application and submission informationbudgetto be eligible, the parent award must be able to receive funds in fy2023 (oct. 1, 2022 - sept. 30, 2023). applicants are strongly encouraged to contact the program officer of the parent award to confirm eligibility.the total requested budget cannot exceed $150k direct cost including cloud resources. please see additional information section if requesting budget for cloud services. the number of awards will be contingent on availability of funds and receipt of meritorious applications.eligible activity codes:additional funds may be awarded as supplements to parent awards using any activity code that is listed in pa-20-272, with the following exceptions: small business activity codes (e.g., r41, r42, r43, r44, u44, and fast track), as well as fellowship activity codes (e.g., f05, f30, f31, f32, f33 and f99) are not eligible. note that not all participating nih institutes and centers (ics) support all the activity codes that may otherwise be allowed. applicants are therefore strongly encouraged to consult the program officer of the parent grant to confirm eligibility.centers and multi-project grant mechanisms are eligible but must provide a strong justification for why existing funds cannot be reallocated toward the proposed project and clearly demonstrate benefit of leveraging cloud solution.for awards that already include funds for cloud services, applicants should provide strong justification for why additional funds are needed, given that these activities could already be supported through the parent award.additional informationapplications for this initiative must be submitted using the following opportunity or its subsequent reissued equivalent.all instructions in the sf424 (r&r) application guide and pa-20-272 must be followed, with the following additions:administrative evaluation processsubmitted applications must follow the guidelines of the ic that funds the parent grant. administrative supplements do not receive peer review. each ic will conduct administrative reviews of applications submitted to their ic separately. the most meritorious applications will be evaluated by a trans-nih panel of nih staff and supported based upon availability of funds. the criteria described below will be considered in the administrative evaluation process:other information:it is strongly recommended that the applicants contact their respective program officers at the institute supporting the parent award in advance to:potential applicants may contact the scientific contact listed on this nosi in advance of the application receipt date for clarifications about the scope of this supplemental funding opportunity.please direct all inquiries to:scientific/research contact(s)fenglou maooffice of data science strategy (odss)division of program coordination, planning, and strategic initiativesoffice of the directortelephone: 301-451-9389cloudsupport@nih.govweekly toc for this announcement nih funding opportunities and noticesnote: for help accessing pdf, rtf, ms word, excel, powerpoint, audio or video files, see help downloading files.
