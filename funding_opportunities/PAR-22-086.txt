eligibility.this funding opportunity announcement (foa) solicits grant applications proposing to utilize bacteria, archaebacteria, bacteriophages, or other non-oncolytic viruses and their natural products to study the underlying mechanisms of the complex interactions between microorganisms, tumors, and the immune system, and to explore their clinical potential for cancer imaging, therapeutics or diagnostics. projects can focus on using microorganisms as anti-tumor agents, as activators of anti-tumor immunity, or as delivery vehicles for treatment, diagnosis, or imaging, complementing or synergizing with existing tools and approaches. this foa will support basic mechanistic and preclinical studies in cell culture and animal models. applicants are encouraged to address both the microbial and tumor aspects of microbial tumor interactions relevant to microbial-based cancer therapy (including therapies for oral cancer), tumor imaging, tumor detection, or diagnosisthis funding opportunity is part of a broader nci-sponsored research on microbial based cancer therapy.not applicableall applications are due by 5:00 pm local time of applicant organization.applicants are encouraged to apply early to allow adequate time to make any corrections to errors found in the application during the submission process by the due date.not applicableit is critical that applicants follow the instructions in the research (r) instructions in the sf424 (r&r) application guide,except where instructed to do otherwise (in this foa or in a notice from nih guide for grants and contracts ).conformance to all requirements (both in the application guide and the foa) is required and strictly enforced. applicants must read and follow all application instructions in the application guide as well as any program-specific instructions noted in section iv. when the program-specific instructions deviate from those in the application guide, follow the program-specific instructions.applications that do not comply with these instructions may be delayed or not accepted for review.there are several options available to submit your application through grants.gov to nih and department of health and human services partners. you must use one of these submission options to access the application forms for this opportunity.purposethe purpose of this foa is to encourage grant applications to study novel microbial-based cancer therapy (including therapies for oral cancer), imaging detection, and diagnosis strategies to overcome the limitations of inadequate conventional cancer imaging and therapies. solutions may utilize bacteria, archaebacteria, bacteriophages, and other microorganisms and their products (but not oncolytic viruses).this foa utilizes the r21 award mechanism for exploratory/developmental projects. the r21 mechanism is suitable for projects that are at their inception, conceptual, or idea-based phase where proof-of-principle of the proposed methodology has not been established with the aim to demonstrate core functional capabilities of the proposed approach. in this phase, the technical feasibility of the proposed technology or methodology should not yet have been established.this foa runs in parallel with a companion foa, par-22-085, which uses the research project (grant r01) mechanism. it is the appropriate foa for more mature applications that include preliminary data that demonstrate the feasibility of the specific aims.background and rationalebackground and rationale early clinical observations in the 1880s by coley pioneered the concept of using bacteria (or their products) as microbial-based cancer therapy and demonstrated that tumor regression coincided with natural bacterial infections, leading to the first use of microbes as antitumor agents. with the development of the more effective and better-understood radiation therapy, and later, chemotherapy-based cancer therapies, this approach was largely abandoned in the 1930s and microbial-based therapy has remained an elusive goal. however, standard cancer therapies have several major disadvantages, including the rarity of complete and sustained remissions of most solid tumors, the development of resistance, frequent failure to clear micrometastases, and relapse. to overcome the limitations of current cancer imaging and therapies, microbial tumor homing and colonization, oncolysis, and activation of anti-tumor immunity are being explored as alternative strategies. because bugs as drugs are potentially self-regenerated cancer therapeutics, the approach may address cancer therapy needs for global health and low resource settingsmechanisms of microbial-based cancer therapyseveral facultative or obligate anaerobic bacteria possess unique natural or genetically engineered potential to overcome traditional therapeutic limitations by selectively targeting tumors and/or anti-tumor immunity. for example, salmonella, escherichia coli, clostridium, bifidobacterium, or listeria are naturally capable of selective homing to tumors when systemically administered, resulting in high levels of colonization and replication in locally hypoxic tumor microenvironments or within tumor tissues leading to killing tumor cells, reprograming the immune system to target cancer cells. therapeutic bacteria can stimulate the production or localized in the tumor of cd8+t lymphocytes or block immune checkpoint pathways.microbial products (including microbial toxins) and microbial metabolites are also associated with anti-tumor activities. microbial metabolites can inhibit tumor cells growth in vitro, modulate t-cell response to checkpoint inhibitors, reduce carcinogenic inflammation, inhibit tumor cell invasion and migration, suppress histone deacetylase activity, and induce apoptosiscancer clinical needs and challengesthere is a need for improved cancer therapies (including therapies for oral cancer), especially for solid tumors where conventional therapies often fail under conditions such as poorly vascularized tumors with inadequate blood perfusion, hypoxia, nutritional deprivation, tumor interstitial pressure, immature lymphatic system, immunosuppressive microenvironment, tumor dormancy, distant tumor metastasis, slowly dividing cells resistant to treatment, or islands of microinvasive tumor cells buried within normal tissues and drug resistance. in addition, it is important to develop new cancer immunotherapy modalities. among the most attractive characteristics of microbial agents for anticancer therapies is their capacity for tumor-specific targeting and activation of the immune system. thus, for example, it may be possible to develop a bacteria-based cancer treatment platform for in situ release of immune checkpoint inhibitors.recent research advancements in bacterial anti-cancer activitiesmultiple studies have demonstrated that anaerobic microorganisms have the unique ability to grow selectively in hypoxic immunosuppressed areas of solid tumors that often are not accessible to drugs. more recently, an integrated bacterial cancer treatment approach utilizing a single multi-function, bacterial payloads for cancer imaging, activation of the immune system, and tumor cell killing were demonstrated. a white paper on the challenges and opportunities of microbial anti-cancer therapy and prevention summarizes the potential of microbial therapy and recent research advances. promising results from these studies and the availability of sophisticated gene-editing technology, offer the prospect of developing new concepts and strategies for the use of microbial therapies to mitigate or solve unmet clinical needs. other studies have shown that gut microbial metabolites can modify the transcription, epigenetics, and metabolism of host immune cells, which can be utilized to activate the immune system. while recent research demonstrates the potential of microbial-based cancer therapy, more research is needed to realize this potential and to bring novel microbial-based therapies to the clinic especially for conditions where conventional cancer therapies are inadequatescope and research objectives of this foathe complex nature of the interactions between the microbe, tumor, and immune system requires multidisciplinary collaboration between microbiologists, cancer researchers, and immunologists with the goal of developing innovative approaches to improve our understanding of this system and utilize it for cancer therapy. this initiative seeks to support studies of tumor-microbe interactions needed to develop new cancer imaging and therapy strategies that address unmet clinical needs. the multi-disciplinary research teams are expected to conduct cutting-edge research aimed at advancing pre-clinical development of novel bacteria-based anticancer therapeutic or diagnostic agents. the goal is to conduct research that could have a major impact on cancer therapy and related researchmulti-disciplinary research teams are expected to conduct cutting-edge research within the scope of the foa (see above) aimed at advancing pre-clinical development of novel microbial-based anticancer therapeutic agents, cancer imaging, and diagnostics technologies, or to study the complex biology involved in the interplay of microbe-tumor-immune system interactions. applicants applying to this foa are expected to address both the microbial and the tumor aspects of microbial cancer therapy, the goal is to conduct research that could have a major impact on cancer therapy and related research.potential areas of research may include, but are not limited to:microbial-based cancer detection and diagnosismicrobial species with cancer-selective homing to tumors and colonization have the potential to overcome traditional cancer detection and diagnosis limitations, especially for asymptomatic cancers. microbes are potentially useful for tumor detection and diagnosis and may provide information about the tumor organ site and characteristics, which facilitates cancer staging, management, and treatmentmicrobial-based cancer detection and diagnosis specific research areas:microbial-based cancer imagingmany facultative or obligate anaerobic bacteria and engineered bacteria are capable of selective homing and penetrating tumors when systemically administered which is potentially useful for tumor in vivo imaging. by using tumor-specific colonization properties of labeled bacteria, it may be possible to enhance the resolution and sensitivity of various in vivo tumor imaging modalities including ct, mri, pet, spect, ultrasound, optical imaging, etc. for tumor margin detection/excision.cancer imaging specific research areas:nci's center for global healthmicrobial-based cancer therapy may provide new opportunities, because of the relative simplicity of microbial culturing, microbes may have the potential to be self-regenerating cancer therapeutics, the ultimate sustainable cancer treatment for low and low middle income countries (lmic). examples of the center for global health specific topics of interest may include:national institute of dental and craniofacial research (nidcr)nidcr support for this initiative includes research and development of bacterial anticancer agents for the treatment of cancers of the oral cavity, oropharynx, and salivary glands. therefore, in addition to the general areas of research listed above, examples of nidcr-specific
