(2) encourage individuals from diverse backgrounds, including those from groups underrepresented in the biomedical and behavioral sciences, to pursue further studies or careers in research; (3) help recruit individuals with specific specialty or disciplinary backgrounds to research careers in biomedical, behavioral and clinical sciences; and (4) foster a better understanding of biomedical, behavioral and clinical research and its implications.the overarching goal of this r25 program is to support educational activities that complement and/or enhance the training of a workforce to meet the nation’s biomedical, behavioral and clinical research needs.the overarching goal of this r25 program is to provide support to recipients of clinical and translational science awards (ctsa) for research experiencess that complement and/or enhance the training of a workforce to meet the nation’s biomedical, behavioral and clinical research needs. to accomplish this over-arching goal, this foa will support creative educational activities with a primary focus on:proposed research experiences should involve an innovative approach to provide hands-on exposure to clinical and translational science research in a laboratory or a field setting for a full-time (40 hours per week) period of 10 to 15 weeks in order to stimulate the interest and advance the knowledge base of participants to consider further education and training for future careers as clinical and translational science researchers. the proposed programs should provide research experiences that are not available through formal nih training mechanisms.research education programs may complement ongoing research training and education occurring at the applicant institution, but the proposed educational experiences must be distinct from those training and education programs currently receiving federal support. r25 programs may augment institutional research training programs (e.g., t32, t90) but cannot be used to replace or circumvent ruth l. kirschstein national research service award (nrsa) programs.backgroundthe national center for advancing translational sciences (ncats) at the national institutes of health (nih), is transforming the translational science process so that new treatments and cures for disease can be delivered to patients faster. ncats strives to develop innovations to reduce, remove or bypass costly and time-consuming bottlenecks in the translational research pipeline in an effort to speed the delivery of new drugs, diagnostics and medical devices to patients. translation is the process of turning observations in the laboratory, clinic and community into interventions that improve the health of individuals and the public — from diagnostics and therapeutics to medical procedures and behavioral changes. translational science is the field of investigation focused on understanding the scientific and operational principles underlying each step of the translational process. ncats studies translation on a system-wide level as a scientific and operational problem. the ncats approach is not to focus on specific diseases, but on what is common among them and the translational science process. ncats does this by developing new approaches, technologies, resources and models; demonstrating their usefulness; and disseminating the data, analysis and methodologies to the community.the goal of the ncats clinical and translational science awards (ctsa) program is to develop innovative solutions that will improve the efficiency, quality and impact of the process for turning observations in the laboratory, clinic and community into interventions that improve the health of individuals and the public. sustaining a vibrant clinical and translational research enterprise requires a 21st century workforce that can advance clinical and translational science that will, in turn, increase the efficiency and efficacy of translation with the ultimate goal of getting more treatments to more patients more quickly.examples of research experiences include:applications not responsive to this foathe following types of applications will be deemed nonresponsive and will not be reviewed:see section viii. other information for award authorities and regulations.grant: a support mechanism providing money, property, or both to an eligible entity to carry out an approved project or activity.the oer glossary and the sf424 (r&r) application guide provide details on these application types. only those application types listed here are allowed for this foa.not allowed: only accepting applications that do not propose clinical trial(s).need help determining whether you are doing a clinical trial?need help determining whether you are doing a clinical trial?the number of awards is contingent upon nih appropriations and the submission of a sufficient number of meritorious applications.the maximum budget is $100,000 direct costs/year. the budget request for a given application needs to be adequately justified and reflect the actual needs of the proposed project. yearly fluctuations in the project workload should be reflected in the requested budget.the scope of the proposed project should determine the project period. the maximum project period is 5 years.individuals designing, directing, and implementing the research education program may request salary and fringe benefits appropriate for the person months devoted to the program. salaries requested may not exceed the levels commensurate with the institution's policy for similar positions and may not exceed the congressionally mandated cap.
