in the sf424 (r&r) application guide, except where instructed to do otherwise (in this foa or in a notice from nih guide for grants and contracts).conformance to all requirements (both in the application guide and the foa) is required and strictly enforced. applicants must read and follow all application instructions in the application guide as well as any program-specific instructions noted in section iv. when the program-specific instructions deviate from those in the application guide, follow the program-specific instructions.applications that do not comply with these instructions may be delayed or not accepted for review.there are several options available to submit your application through grants.gov to nih and department of health and human services partners. you must use one of these submission options to access the application forms for this opportunity.purpose:the purpose of this funding opportunity announcement (foa) is to support innovative multidisciplinary, investigative, and collaborative research focused on developing and testing multi-level or multi-component strategies -including models of health care- that effectively adapt and implement recommended guidelines of comprehensive clinical care for individuals with type 2 diabetes from populations with health disparities.this foa is built on a previous notice of special interest (not-md-20-026) which expires on may 8, 2021.key definitionsnih-designated u.s. health disparity populations include blacks/african americans, hispanics/latinos, american indians/alaska natives, asian americans, native hawaiians and other pacific islanders, socioeconomically disadvantaged populations, underserved rural populations, and sexual and gender minorities (https://www.nimhd.nih.gov/about/overview/).the term “multi-component” refers to the different components of the health care models (e.g., health care system organization, clinician decision support, clinical information system, patient self-management support, delivery system design and community and peer or family resources and support).the term “multi-level” refers to the multi-dimensional framework of determinants relevant to understand and address minority health and health disparities. this concept is further described under the nimhd research framework (https://www.nimhd.nih.gov/about/overview/research-framework/).background:most current national statistics reveal an overall prevalence of diabetes mellitus (all types) of 14.3%. the prevalence of diabetes mellitus among racial/ethnic minorities has consistently been significantly higher (more recently in the 20.6%-23.5% range or twice as high) as that of non-hispanic whites (nhws) (11.3%) and is on the rise. in addition, the prevalence of self-reported diabetes mellitus in rural areas is 17% higher than in metropolitan areas, 20-55% higher in individuals from sexual and gender minority (sgm) groups than non-sgm individuals, and inversely associated with income and socioeconomic status.the limited existing data on diabetes-related complications in u.s. populations with health disparities points towards a significant risk of and burden of complications. for instance, some studies have demonstrated that african americans have four times and asians and pacific islanders have 1.5 times increased risk for diabetic retinopathy (dr) than nhws, and individuals from rural settings may have 21% greater risk of dr than those living in urban settings. other studies have reported that the prevalence of dr in hispanics/latinos could be up to 46.9% and for american indians/alaska natives 45.3%. also, hispanic/latinos, african americans and american indians/alaska natives have 1.3-1.5 times greater risk for major amputations than nhws. regarding diabetic nephropathy, african americans with type 2 diabetes have been shown to have 1.5 greater risk of developing end-stage renal disease (esrd) compared to nhws. within a staff model health maintenance organization with diabetes registry, all racial and ethnic minority patients had a significant elevated risk of esrd compared to nhw. albuminuria – a known risk factor for coronary artery disease in many populations- has been associated with increased risk left ventricular systolic and diastolic dysfunction among american indians with type 2 diabetes. at the same time, from 1996 to 2016, studies have demonstrated a progressive decline in adjusted incidence of diabetes-related esrd among african americans (20% decline), american indians/alaska natives (53% decline), and hispanics/latinos (33% decline) -no significant change among persons of asian descent and 17% increase in nhws- which has been attributed to increased prescription of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (aceis) or angiotensin receptor blockers (arbs). in addition, the strong heart study and the hispanic community health study/study of latinos have demonstrated significantly increased likelihood of microalbuminuria among american indians and hispanics/latinos with prediabetes compared to those with normoglycemia.on the other hand, completion rates of all or some of the recommended clinical assessments for persons with diabetes (e.g., hemoglobin a1c /lipid/blood pressure targets, annual fundoscopic exam, foot exam, urine albumin and estimated glomerular filtration rate, influenza/pneumonia vaccines and others) tend to be 10-30% lower for racial/ethnic minority populations than for nhws. compared to 25% in the u.s. states, only 7-11% of persons with diabetes in the u.s. territories puerto rico, u.s. virgin islands and guam had engaged in biannual hemoglobin a1c testing, attendance to diabetes education classes, daily self-blood glucose monitoring, and annual foot exam. persons with diabetes living in rural areas have 11-14% lower odds to have at least one foot exam or a fundoscopic exam in the past year than residents of urban areas. these lower completion rates may in part contribute to increased odds for preventable hospitalizations and readmissions.patient-centered models of care, like the chronic care model (ccm), have been recommended as effective frameworks for optimal diabetes care. the implementation and effectiveness of the full ccm -or some of its variations or components- in the management of type 2 diabetes have been studied in different populations and settings in the u.s. significant improvement in clinical outcomes, cardiovascular risk scores, and completion rates of recommended tests have been demonstrated by some studies. other studies have demonstrated improvement in glycemic control with the integration of cultural competence at the self-management and community resources levels, but no consistent improvement with interventions at the delivery system level. on the other hand, low adherence at the clinician decision support level and lack of necessary infrastructure for sustainable tele-health care delivery may have hindered the potential impact of embedding digital technology within components of the ccm. the percent of patients from racial/ethnic minority groups participating in the previously mentioned studies ranged between 1% and 13%, and very few studies have been dedicated to developing and testing the ccm or other models of diabetes care for populations with health disparities or within the context of low-income/low-resource clinical settings.effective implementation of and adherence to recommended guidelines of care [e.g., assessment of risk of diabetes-related complications, setting optimal glycemic goals and control of cardiovascular disease (cvd) risk factors, designing a treatment plan, medical/dental/nutritional referrals, immunizations and other preventive services] are urgently needed for individuals with type 2 diabetes from populations with health disparities. effective strategies would be expected to have a positive impact on health outcomes across all populations, while potentially generating new information and research hypotheses on treatment effectiveness and precision medicine.research objectivesthe overarching goal of this foa is to support innovative, multidisciplinary, and multi-level/multi-component research designed to optimize type 2 diabetes care for populations with health disparities concordant with evidence-based guidelines. proposed projects would be expected to develop and/or test and/or evaluate patient-centered strategies or health care models, which in addition to attainment of optimal glycemic control, would aim at attaining other goals related to recommended guidelines of care: annual fundoscopic exam, comprehensive foot evaluation at least once a year, annual urine albumin test, hemoglobin a1c testing at least two times a year or as needed, peripheral neuropathy assessment as needed -and other recommended assessments based on the patient’s health profile- optimal blood pressure and ldl-cholesterol control, and intake of acei or arb/statin/aspirin and other treatments and preventive care, as indicated.the effects of the implementation of these strategies or health care models on health outcomes and health care disparities, quality of life, optimal care of comorbidities, and prevention of short- and long-term complications associated with diabetes -including acute adverse events, infections, hypoglycemia, urgent/emergency care, hospitalizations, retinopathy and other ocular complications, nephropathy, neuropathy, lower extremity infections/amputations- are also of interest. in addition, the national institute of diabetes and kidney and digestive diseases (niddk) is interested in interventions and approaches on increased screening of prediabetes and type 2 diabetes and prevention of type 2 diabetes in populations with health/health care disparities (see niddk specific research areas of interest below).research methodologythe initiative will support interventions (especially multi-level or multi-component interventions), clinical trials (including cluster-randomized trials, pragmatic trials), quasi-experimental studies, mixed-methods studies, retrospective quantitative research, simulation modeling, policy evaluations, and evaluations of existing interventions and practices in health care settings serving u.s. populations with health disparities.specific areas of interestareas of interest include but are not limited to:collaborating institutes' specific areas of interest:national eye institute (nei)nei is interested in research aimed at improving diabetes-related eye care in heath disparity populations. specific topics of interest include but are not limited to the following research areas:national institute of diabetes and digestive and kidney diseases (niddk)niddk is primarily interested in clinical trials aimed at prevention and treatment of type 2 diabetes, including diabetes-related complications in the mission of niddk such as metabolic liver disease, diabetic nephropathy and foot ulcers. proposed observational studies should be limited to the evaluation of natural experiments that employ appropriate designs and methodologies necessary to strengthen casual inferences. meaningful stakeholder engagement, particularly of hardly reached populations with health/ health care disparities, is strongly encouraged to inform the study design and conduct and to optimize potential uptake and sustainability. specific topics include but are not limited to:the nih office on research in women’s health (orwh)orwh is part of the office of the director of the nih and works in partnership with the 27 nih institutes and centers to ensure that women's health research is part of the scientific framework at the nih and is supported in the larger scientific community. orwh uses a multidimensional framework to represent the intersection of factors that underlie patterns of disease and determinants of health outcomes in populations. biomedical research that considers sex and gender influences, alongside race, social class and other factors, will enhance understanding and inform disease self-management, clinician/patient-clinician shared decision making, and access to care to ensure health equity and achieve optimal health outcomes for all.for purposes of this funding opportunity announcement, orwh is interested in providing support for innovative interdisciplinary, behavioral, clinical, and/or translational studies that contribute to diabetes treatment effectiveness, with a particular focus on populations of women who are understudied, underrepresented, and underreported in research.examples include studies that seek to develop patient-centered care enhancements or create health promotion and health care intervention strategies. for additional guidance, please refer to the 2019-2023 trans-nih strategic plan for the health of women on the orwh
