thus, improving metabolomics technologies and making them more accessible to researchers could advance cancer research across the basic-translational-clinical cancer research continuum.nci administers two unique programs focused on the development of technologies that offer transformative potential for advancing cancer research. the innovative molecular analysis technologies (imat) program supports highly innovative, data-generating platforms and methodologies. the program solicits grant applications for early-stage development of novel tools and methods that enable cancer researchers across the entire spectrum of cancer research. the informatics technologies for cancer research (itcr) program supports powerful data analysis, management, and visualization technologies. the program supports research-driven informatics technology development spanning all aspects of cancer research and across the tool development lifecycle.the nci seeks to stimulate technology development to facilitate transformational new approaches for cancer metabolomics and lipidomics research through the imat and itcr programs. therefore, this announcement seeks to address the need for new technologies designed explicitly to overcome technical challenges and advance cancer metabolomics. such research could include, but is not limited to, launching new and innovative analytical and software platforms, improving the ability of researchers to process more complex samples or increase sample throughput, and/or developing novel computational approaches or tools that facilitate metabolomics data analysis, interpretation, and integration.specific areas of research interestboth imat and itcr support projects across the continuum of basic-translational-clinical cancer research.innovative molecular analysis technologies (imat)informatics technology for cancer research (itcr)the following tools and technologies are of particular interest to nci:proposals to this nosi should consider the following:application and submission informationthis notice applies to due dates on or after june 14, 2022, and subsequent receipt dates through december 31, 2024.submit applications for this initiative using one of the following funding opportunity announcements (foas) or any reissues of these foas through the expiration date of this notice.technology areatechnology stagemechanismrfabudgetfirst available due datemolecular and cellular analysis technologiesearly-stage exploratory projectsr61rfa-ca-22-001direct costs are limited to $150,000 per year for up to 3 years.september 22, 2022molecular and cellular analysis technologiesdevelopmental-stage projectsr33rfa-ca-22-002direct costs are limited to $300,000 per year for up to 3 years.september 22, 2022biospecimen science technologiesearly-stage exploratory projectsr61rfa-ca-22-003direct costs are limited to $150,000 per year for up to 3 years.september 22, 2022biospecimen science technologiesdevelopmental-stage projectsr33rfa-ca-22-004direct costs are limited to $300,000 per year for up to 3 years.september 22, 2022informatics toolsalgorithm developmentr21rfa-ca-22-021direct costs are limited to $275,000 over a two-year period. no more than $200,000 may be requested in any single year.june 14, 2022informatics toolsprototyping and hardeningu01rfa-ca-22-022direct costs are limited to $300,000 (excluding consortium f&a) per year.june 14, 2022informatics toolsenhancement and disseminationu24rfa-ca-22-023direct costs are limited to $600,000 (excluding consortium f&a) per year.june 14, 2022informatics toolssustainmentu24rfa-ca-22-024application budgets are not limited but need to reflect the actual needs of the proposed project.june 14, 2022all instructions in the sf424 (r&r) application guide and the funding opportunity announcement used for submission must be followed, with the following additions:applications nonresponsive to terms of this nosi will not be considered for the nosi initiative.scientific/research contact(s)sean hanlon, phd national cancer institute (nci) telephone: 240-281-3310 email: hanlonse@mail.nih.govpeer review contact(s)examine your era commons account for review assignment and contact information (information appears two weeks after the submission due date).financial/grants management contact(s)crystal wolfrey national cancer institute telephone: 240-276-6277 email: wolfreyc@mail.nih.govweekly toc for this announcement nih funding opportunities and noticesnote: for help accessing pdf, rtf, ms word, excel, powerpoint, audio or video files, see help downloading files.
