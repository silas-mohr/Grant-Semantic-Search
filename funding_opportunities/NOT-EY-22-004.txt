disparities (nimhd)national institute on minority health and health disparities (nimhd)the purpose of this notice of special interest (nosi) is to highlight interest in supporting research that aims to promote health equity in the prevention, treatment, and management of eye and vision conditions. applications that target reduction of health disparities experienced by people who are visually impaired or blind are encouraged, as well as applications that investigate the impact of bias, structural racism, and discrimination in causing or sustaining eye or vision health inequities.backgroundhealth equity means that everyone has the opportunity to attain full health potential (i.e., to be as healthy as possible) and no one is disadvantaged from achieving this potential because of their social position or other socially determined circumstances. eye and vision health are critical components of full health potential, yet there continues to be a notably disproportionate burden of eye and vision diseases in certain populations. in addition, healthcare — including eye and vision care — utilization, quality, and access can be suboptimal or variable, especially for racial/ethnic minorities, people who are visually impaired or blind, rural populations and communities with limited access to care, and other underrepresented populations.national eye institute interestsin 2021, the nei published the national eye institute strategic plan: vision for the future (2021-2025). this strategic plan features nei areas of emphasis that are dedicated to public health and health disparities research. the nei recognizes that eliminating vision loss and improving quality of life involves understanding the causes of disparities in health and disability and adopting strategies that enhance the inclusion of participants who are underrepresented in research, such as racial and ethnic minorities and people who are visually impaired or blind.research to be supported by nei through this nosi must address nei’s mission to eliminate vision loss and improve quality of life through vision research.the overarching objective of this notice is to promote eye and vision related research that advances health equity and reduces health disparities. topics of interest include but are not limited to the following areas:identifying environmental factors, behavioral factors, social determinants, and other underlying mechanisms that lead to differences in eye and vision health status.examining racial and ethnic differences in screening, diagnosis, and management of eye and vision conditions, and whether there are differences among groups in terms of disease progression.investigating existence and impact of institutional or provider bias, including racism and discrimination, in the delivery of healthcare services.evaluating new or existing interventions or community-based interventional programs and policies that promote health equity.assessing strategies to implement health promotion, prevention, telemedicine, screening, and automated diagnosis, as well as effective treatments, rehabilitation efforts, clinical procedures or guidelines with the intent of reducing health disparitiesassessing shifts in modes of healthcare delivery (e.g., telemedicine) and how these shifts are impacting health outcomes.developing study designs, research methods, and biostatistical analytic approaches for conducting health disparities and health equity research.evaluating strategies to recruit racial and ethnic minority participants in eye and vision research and/or to promote inclusion of people who are visually impaired or blind in research.preparing a new generation of researchers who are well trained in health disparity researchit is recognized that both biological and non-biological factors may be affecting health outcomes. investigators may refer to the national institute on minority health and health disparities (nimhd) research framework to discover a wide array of health determinants relevant to understanding and addressing minority health and health disparities: national institute on minority health and health disparities (nimhd) research frameworkapplications that examine the influence of factors in which people are born, grow, live, work, and age (i.e., social determinants of health) are strongly encouraged to use measures available in the social determinants of health collection of the phenx toolkit (phenx toolkit), as appropriate.projects may involve primary data collection or secondary analysis of existing datasets, as supported by the selected funding opportunity and grant mechanism. collaborations with or among investigators of extant cohorts and clinical trials are appropriate so that these studies may jointly develop protocols and evaluate findings.national institute on minority health and health disparities (nimhd) interestsnimhd is focused on research that promotes health equity in populations that experience health disparities (see nih definition of (health disparity populations), which include racial and ethnic minority populations (american indian or alaska natives, asian, black or african american, and native hawaiian or other pacific islander, and hispanic or latino), less privileged socioeconomic status (ses) populations, underserved rural populations, sexual and gender minorities (sgm), and any subpopulations that can be characterized by two or more of these descriptions.nimhd is especially interested in:interventions that improve access to evidence-based recommended screening and treatment of eye/vision conditions for persons with no or inadequate health insurance coverage (e.g., some immigrant populations). cost effectiveness, affordability and sustainability of those interventions are of interest.interventions designed to improve access to and recommended utilization of eye/ocular health services for patients with chronic conditions that increase the risk of eye/vision complications (e.g., hypertension, diabetes). cost effectiveness, affordability and sustainability of those interventions are of interest.studies that investigate differences in access to and utilization of cutting-edge and recommended ophthalmological procedures compared to traditional procedures. differences in health outcomes and health care costs, and interventions to address any of these differences are of interest.studies that explore the integration of health information technology in different levels of the health care continuum (e.g., patient self-management, patient portals, integration, and portability of health information across health care systems, clinician to clinician communication, etc.)interventions designed to improve access to, early screening and utilization of eye/ocular health services for patients at high risk of eye/vision disorders associated with environmental exposures (e.g., work-related)application and submission
