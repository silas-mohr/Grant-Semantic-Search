application due dates between september 22 and september 30, 2022see section iii. 3. additional information on eligibility.this funding opportunity announcement (foa) is to provide support for research centers that (1) conduct drug abuse and addiction research in any area of nida’s mission, (2) have outstanding innovative science, (3) are multidisciplinary, thematically integrated, synergistic, and (4) serve as national resource(s) to provide educational and outreach activities to drug abuse research communities, educational organizations, the general public, and policy makers in the nida research fields. it is expected that a center will transform knowledge in the sciences it is studying. incremental work should not be the focus of center activities; rather, new and creative directions are required. the p50 center of excellence is expected to foster the career development and mentoring of new investigators who would be given meaningful roles to play in the center projects. a goal of this program is to create nida centers that are national community resources for furthering drug abuse research by sharing their findings, their data, and their resources as appropriate for researchers to use and build upon and to advance research in this field.30 days prior to the application due dateall applications are due by 5:00 pm local time of applicant organization.applicants are encouraged to apply early to allow adequate time to make any corrections to errors found in the application during the submission process by the due date.not applicableit is critical that applicants follow the multi-project (m) instructions in the sf424 (r&r) application guide, except where instructed to do otherwise (in this foa or in a notice from the nih guide for grants and contracts). conformance to all requirements (both in the application guide and the foa) is required and strictly enforced. applicants must read and follow all application instructions in the application guide as well as any program-specific instructions noted in section iv. when the program-specific instructions deviate from those in the application guide, follow the program-specific instructions. applications that do not comply with these instructions may be delayed or not accepted for review.there are several options available to submit your application through grants.gov to nih and department of health and human services partners. you must use one of these submission options to access the application forms for this opportunity.research objectivesnida supports research center grants to foster an innovative, synergistic and thematically coherent approach to drug abuse and addiction research and to enable studies that would not occur without the climate, facilities and/or interactive research resources that a research center can uniquely provide. nida encourages the application of multiple scientific perspectives and approaches to the problem of addiction to support the highest quality, multidisciplinary programs of innovative research. through the centers program, nida seeks to encourage outstanding scientists to bring a full range of expertise, approaches, technologies, and creativity to the study of problems related to drug abuse and addiction. investigative efforts are expected to be broadly based and to encompass a variety of areas, including biological, biomedical, social, behavioral, and/or clinical sciences as well as dissemination sciences to address critical research issues.nida centers are expected to be scientifically innovative and provide the next generation of ideas and approaches. it is expected that a center will transform knowledge in the sciences it is studying and be at the cutting edge of science. incremental work, though valuable, should not be the focus of center activities.nida centers are expected to be thematically coherent and demonstrate the highest caliber of multidisciplinary scientific work; an overarching theme should integrate and focus the center. each core and research component should relate to the overall center theme and to other components of the center to provide a synergy that leads to creative thinking, novel approaches, innovations, and highly significant findings. interactions and integration of projects should be clearly evident, so that the center does not appear to be a collection of independent research projects. there should be linkages among components that result in levels of productivity, quality, and progress that will exceed those expected from combining the individual components in an additive fashion. linkages may be conceptual, spatial, and/or temporal. interdependency of the scientific projects may allow for a variety of arrangements, for example, multiple research components sharing a common subject pool managed through a core or a common imaging protocol managed in a core to allow for comparability of data across research projects. the type of integration proposed may be different for different genres of science, including: conceptual integration or sharing of data, instruments, or other resources. linkages should encourage cross-fertilization of ideas and interactions among investigators that are relevant to the theme. multidisciplinary research activity is expected across a variety of disciplines or sub-disciplines to bring multiple scientific perspectives and approaches to a research area or question.in addition, nida research centers are expected to serve as national research resources in the drug abuse research field to provide educational and outreach activities to drug abuse research communities, educational organizations, the general public, and policy makers in the nida research fields. they are expected to attract established and promising investigators into drug abuse research. the p50 center application is expected to foster the career development and mentoring of new investigators and provide opportunities for effective dissemination of research findings.special considerationsnational advisory council on drug abuse recommended guidelines for the administration of drugs to human subjects: the national advisory council on drug abuse (nacda) recognizes the importance of research involving the administration of drugs with abuse potential, and dependence or addiction liability, to human subjects. potential applicants are encouraged to obtain and review these recommendations of council before submitting an application that will administer compounds to human subjects. for more information, see http://www.drugabuse.gov/funding/clinical-research/nacda-guidelines-administration-drugs-to-human-subjects.points to consider regarding tobacco industry funding of nida applicants: the national advisory council on drug abuse (nacda) encourages nida and its grantees to consider the points it has set forth with regard to existing or prospective sponsored research agreements with tobacco companies or their related entities and the impact of acceptance of tobacco industry funding on nida's credibility and reputation within the scientific community. for more information, see http://www.drugabuse.gov/about-nida/advisory-boards-groups/national-advisory-council-drug-abuse-nacda/council-statements/points-to-consider-regarding-tobacco-industry-funding-nida.data harmonization for substance abuse and addiction via the phenx toolkit: nida strongly encourages investigators involved in human-subjects studies to employ a common set of tools and resources that will promote the collection of comparable data across studies and to do so by incorporating the measures from the core and specialty collections, which are available in the substance abuse and addiction collection of the phenx toolkit (www.phenxtoolkit.org). for more information see https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/not-da-12-008.html.data sharing: nida strongly encourages investigators to share data with other investigators. nida expects that applicants to nida funding opportunity announcements: 1) submit their data to one of the nih data archives for sharing; 2) include specific required elements in the resource sharing plan including a description of whether and how the consents that will be used to obtain that data will affect the research that can be done with that data; and 3) include costs attributed to data preparation and submission to a data archive in grant applications.see section viii. other information for award authorities and regulations.grant: a support mechanism

component.specific aims:specific aims are required.research strategy:nida now limits centers to a maximum of two competitive segments, each for a maximum of 5 years of support. all applications for nida centers should include plans for orderly completion of the center’s programs and projects within the 5-year project period.each center application is expected to provide evidence of an environment that promotes the conduct of the highest quality, state-of-the-art research, innovation, and leadership in its areas of investigation. applicants are expected to demonstrate that the center is, or would serve as, a significant national scientific research resource soon after its establishment, to provide educational and outreach activities to drug abuse research communities, educational organizations, the general public, and policy makers. for renewals, the application is expected to demonstrate its past success and how the center will continue to serve as a national resource.much of the shared research environment and many facilities will be located in or funded through the core components. the overall section should discuss 1) how each core component contributes toward cost-effectiveness and quality control in resource utilization among the research components, and 2) how data analytic capacities, database facilities and data resources would be utilized among center components.all nida centers are expected to clearly demonstrate that they support innovative, rigorous, thematically focused, and productive research that is the result of interacting components of the research program that would not emerge from the mere collection of those individual components. a cadre of experienced, independent and productive investigators should be present with active collaborations in place or planned. these investigators should evidence productivity, stature and leadership, or a potentially strong leadership role, in their respective fields. a broad range of expertise relevant to the center's goals should be present. investigative efforts may encompass researchers with primary appointments at the applicant institution as well as at other collaborating sites. investigators are expected to commit to data sharing and ongoing communications with other investigators in the center, consistent with achieving the goals of the program.applications should explicitly discuss the integration of work proposed in the application. further, applications should demonstrate that use of the research center mechanism is essential to accomplishing studies that would not occur without the climate, facilities and research resources that a research center can uniquely provide.for renewal applications only: include a progress report including a summary of the most significant advances accomplished during the prior period of support. the progress report should demonstrate the research environment's conduciveness to productivity by identifying the originally approved specific aims, the progress made on each specific aim, and relevant publications produced in the previous funding period. it is especially important that renewals (1) identify innovative work accomplished by the center during the current funding period and (2) propose innovative work for the new funding period. major findings should be presented with clear descriptions of the importance of these findings to advances in the field. changes in the specific aims, including termination of research components or cores, should be described and justified. the application should also address any significant organizational changes, and provide a summary of the career development opportunities and mentoring provided to junior investigators as well as results of education and dissemination activities. centers that conduct clinical trials must also provide a summary of recruitment, retention, and safety issues, for each trial conducted.progress report publication list: include also a progress report publication list. cite complete references to appropriate publications and manuscripts accepted for publication that resulted from the work during the prior funding period.resource sharing plan: individuals are required to comply with the instructions for the resource sharing plans as provided in the sf424 (r&r) application guide.the following

revision applications, an introduction to application is allowed for each component.specific aims: specific aims are required.research strategy:the administrative core is expected to have appropriate and effective administrative and organizational capabilities to support multidisciplinary research, to foster synergy, and to support planning and evaluation activities. administrative and organizational arrangements should promote joint planning and evaluation activities as well as collaborations and interactions within and across programmatic elements of the center. this should include: (a) an overall programmatic structure that effectively promotes scientific interactions, provides for internal quality control of research and publications, generation of future grant applications, and takes maximum advantage of the center’s drug abuse research capabilities (the description of these attributes is particularly important when there are multiple participating institutions in the center); (b) an administrative organization that has clear lines of authority, is managed efficiently and cost effectively, and enables effective use and leverage of resources; (c) the use of an external advisory structure that is charged to provide appropriate and objective advice and evaluation, as needed, to the center director; note: for new applications, potential or proposed external advisory committee members should not be contacted or named in the application; (d) an internal advisory, decision-making, and priority setting process to support the activities of the center; and (e) appropriate criteria and processes for determining and sustaining individual participation in the center based on productivity, research direction, and overall contribution.education activities: as part of serving as a national resource, a nida p50 center is expected to provide educational and outreach activities to drug abuse research communities, educational organizations, the general public, and policy makers. activities may include, but are not limited to, conferences, seminars, webinars, workshops, newsletters, informational websites, or social media initiatives.career development and mentoring: while the primary function of each center is the conduct of high-quality interdisciplinary research, an important secondary function is fostering the career development and mentoring of research and clinical personnel. career development and mentoring to enhance junior researchers' or other researchers' skills should be conducted in the context of the research. funds may not be used for training not required to conduct the research. however, center staff may participate in the development of related training programs, and center resources may be made available for use by students, post-doctorates, and new investigators seeking experience in drug abuse research. centers are expected to recruit and nurture future generations of scientists to engage in drug abuse and addiction research, especially those from underrepresented backgrounds.resource sharing plan: individuals are required to comply with the instructions for the resource sharing plans as provided in the sf424 (r&r) application guide, with the following modification:letters of support: there should be convincing evidence of the applicant institution's

projects may be used for new, early stage or independent investigators and should represent new projects to develop and explore new activities or directions or take advantage of special opportunities. pilot projects may be “research and development” pilots, feasibility studies, or other pilot work broadly defined as foundational work for further research. pilot projects may not be used to supplement or prolong ongoing research and should not be used as bridge funds when other research support is no longer available.the support of individual pilot project studies is typically of relatively short duration (e.g., 1-2 years), depending upon the nature of the research. applicants may propose and request funding in the first year for specific, already conceptualized pilot projects and also for pilot projects to be added in subsequent years of the project. applications requesting support for pilot projects must describe a process for within-center scientific review of new pilot projects to be initiated in future years of the project and a process for evaluation of ongoing pilot projects for adequate progress. pilot projects presented in the application will be reviewed as part of the assessment of scientific and technical merit of the application and as examples of the kinds of pilot projects the center might initiate in the future as a result of its internal within-center review process.for all pilot projects, describe the internal institutional plans and procedures to ensure that all projects supported from this award will comply fully with all applicable federal regulations, policies, and guidelines for research involving human subjects, including the evaluation of risks and protections in project proposals, appropriate ethical oversight and funded projects, and plans for data and safety monitoring for clinical trials, if applicable.resource sharing plan: individuals are required to comply with the instructions for the resource
