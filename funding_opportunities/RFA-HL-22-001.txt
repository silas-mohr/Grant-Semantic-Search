national institutes of health (nih)national heart, lung, and blood institute (nhlbi)t32 institutional national research service award (nrsa)see section iii. 3. additional information on eligibility.the purpose of this funding opportunity announcement (foa) is to enhance the participation of individuals from diverse backgrounds, including those from groups that are nationally underrepresented in cardiovascular, pulmonary, hematologic and sleep disorders research across the career development continuum by providing support to institutions that promote diversity. the nhlbi's t32 training program for institutions that promote diversity is a ruth l. kirschstein national research service award program intended to support training of predoctoral and health professional students and individuals in postdoctoral training institutions with an institutional mission focused on serving health disparity populations not well represented in scientific research, or institutions that have been identified by federal legislation as having an institutional mission focused on these populations, with the potential to develop meritorious training programs in cardiovascular, pulmonary, and hematologic diseases, and sleep disorders. these institutions are uniquely positioned to engage minority and other health disparity populations in research, translation, and implementation of research advances that impact health outcomes, as well as provide health care for these populations.this funding opportunity announcement (foa) does not allow appointed trainees to lead an independent clinical trial, but does allow them to obtain research experience in a clinical trial led by a mentor or co-mentor.this funding opportunity announcement (foa) does not allow appointed trainees to lead an independent clinical trial, but does allow them to obtain research experience in a clinical trial led by a mentor or co-mentor.30 days prior to the application due datenot applicableit is critical that applicants follow the training (t) instructions in the sf424 (r&r) application guide, except where instructed to do otherwise (in this foa or in a notice from the nih guide for grants and contracts). conformance to all requirements (both in the application guide and the foa) is required and strictly enforced. applicants must read and follow all application instructions in the application guide as well as any program-specific instructions noted in section iv. when the program-specific instructions deviate from those in the application guide, follow the program-specific instructions. applications that do not comply with these instructions may be delayed or not accepted for review.there are several options available to submit your application through grants.gov to nih and department of health and human services partners. you must use one of these submission options to access the application forms for this opportunity.the overall goal of the nih ruth l. kirschstein national research service award (nrsa) program is to help ensure that a diverse pool of highly trained scientists is available in appropriate scientific disciplines to address the nation's biomedical, behavioral, and clinical research needs. in order to accomplish this goal, nrsa training programs are designed to train individuals to conduct research and to prepare for research careers. more information about nrsa programs may be found at the ruth l. kirschstein national research service award (nrsa) website.purpose and background informationthe nrsa program has been the primary means of supporting predoctoral and postdoctoral research training programs since enactment of the nrsa legislation in 1974. research training activities can be in basic biomedical or clinical sciences, in behavioral or social sciences, in health services research, or in any other discipline relevant to the nih mission.institutional nrsa programs allow the training program director/principal investigator (training pd/pi) to select the trainees and develop a program of coursework, research experiences, and technical and/or professional skills development appropriate for the selected trainees. each program should provide high-quality research training and offer opportunities in addition to conducting mentored research. the grant offsets the cost of stipends, tuition and fees, and training related expenses, including health insurance, for the appointed trainees in accordance with agency-approved support levels.program objectivethe national heart, lung, and blood institute (nhlbi) provides global leadership for research, training, and education programs to promote the prevention and treatment of heart, lung, and blood diseases and sleep disorders and enhance the health of all individuals so that they can live longer and more fulfilling lives. the nhlbi stimulates basic discoveries about the causes of disease, enables the translation of basic discoveries into clinical practice, fosters training and mentoring of emerging scientists and physicians, disseminates and implements evidence-based interventions into communities, and communicates research advances to the public. it creates and supports a robust, collaborative research infrastructure in partnership with private and public organizations, including academic institutions, industry, and other government agencies. the institute collaborates with patients, families, health care professionals, scientists, professional societies, patient advocacy groups, community organizations, and the media to promote the application of research results and leverage resources to address public health needs. the nhlbi also collaborates with international organizations to help reduce the burden of heart, lung, and blood diseases worldwide.current population trends predict that by the year 2050 nearly 50 percent of the us population will include medically underserved, vulnerable populations. given the substantial need for physicians, physician scientists and others to care for vulnerable populations, and to contribute to the study of diseases and conditions that disproportionately affect these groups, more efforts are needed to recruit future biomedical researchers from these populations. see, recommendation 8, nih physician-scientist workforce working group report (2014) and the nih notice of interest in diversity. an analysis of nhlbi-supported trainees (independent of individuals supported by diversity related programs) indicates that less than 20 percent of nhlbi-supported trainees are from nationally underrepresented groups.the nhlbi encourages research training and career development crossing disciplinary boundaries (examples: biophysics, biostatistics, bioinformatics, bioengineering, systems science, and big data science) to develop a new interdisciplinary workforce. also of interest to nhlbi are training and career development efforts that focus on implementation research, which studies the optimal and sustainable delivery of evidence-based interventions. novel strategies are needed to disseminate and implement "real world" interventions that produce optimal health outcomes, particularly in underserved populations.dependent on the proposed training program, resident scientific resources and personnel, applicant institutions may choose to identify and collaborate with a research center (medical school or comparable institution) that has strong, well-established cardiovascular, pulmonary, or hematologic diseases research and research training programs to help meet research training needs. nhlbi anticipates that this arrangement will provide each trainee with a mentor who is recognized as an accomplished investigator in cardiovascular, pulmonary, or hematologic diseases and sleep disorders research and who will assist the research advisor at the applicant institution with the trainee's development and research plan. nhlbi expects plans for summer training as well as academic year training to be developed by the student and advisor at the trainee's home institution in collaboration with the mentor at the research center. it is expected that the mentor(s) will guide the trainee through the initial training period and continue this interaction throughout the award. the development of strong mentoring relationships is essential to the success of the trainees and the program.if the applicant chooses to collaborate with an established cardiovascular, pulmonary, and hematologic diseases and sleep disorders research center(s), arrangements must be completed before submitting an application. the trainee and his or her faculty research advisor at the applicant institution will jointly select a faculty mentor at the research center.the nhlbi t32 training program for institutions that promote diversity's goals and objectives are to: (1) enhance the pool of prospective participants from diverse backgrounds, including underrepresented groups in research areas of interest to the nhlbi in the biomedical science enterprise, (2) increase trainee competitiveness for peer-review research funding, (3) strengthen trainee publication records, and (4) foster institutional environments conducive to professional development in the biomedical sciences.the proposed institutional research training program may complement other ongoing research training and career development programs at the applicant institution, but the proposed program must be clearly distinct from related programs currently receiving federal support.program considerationsthe duration of training, the transition of trainees to individual support mechanisms, and their transition to the next career stage are important considerations in institutional training programs. training pds/pis should limit appointments to individuals who are committed to a research career and who plan to remain in training for no less than two years, whether that support comes from a training grant or some combination of nrsa and non-nrsa support programs. training pds/pis should encourage and make available appropriate skills training so that trainees are prepared to apply for subsequent independent support for their training or research program (e.g., an individual fellowship award, mentored career development award, or research project grant), as appropriate for their career stage. in addition, past studies have shown that health professional trainees who train in programs with postdoctoral researchers who have intensive research backgrounds are more likely to apply for and receive subsequent research grant support. programs that emphasize research training for individuals with the md or other health-professional degrees are therefore encouraged to develop ties to basic science departments and include trainees with research doctorates when this approach is consistent with the goals of the proposed training program.biomedical research and the resulting scientific knowledge are increasingly complex and multidisciplinary in nature. training pds/pis are encouraged to develop institutional training programs that will expose trainees to a diversity of scientific approaches, systems for study, research approaches, and tools and technologies. consideration of team-based research approaches may also be warranted depending upon the goals of the proposed training program.within the framework of the nrsa program’s longstanding commitment to excellence and the projected need for investigators in particular areas of research, attention must be given to recruiting prospective trainees from racial or ethnic groups underrepresented in the biomedical, behavioral and clinical sciences, individuals with disabilities, and individuals from disadvantaged backgrounds. see the training (t) instructions in the sf424 (r&r) application guide for further background and instructions.the career outcomes of individuals supported by nrsa training programs include both research-intensive careers in academia and industry and research-related careers in various sectors, e.g., academic institutions, government agencies, for-profit businesses, and private foundations. training programs should make available structured, career development advising and learning opportunities (e.g., workshops, discussions, individual development plans). through such opportunities, trainees are expected to obtain a working knowledge of various potential career directions that make strong use of the knowledge and skills gained during research training and the steps required to transition successfully to the next stage of their chosen career.institutional research training grants must be used to support a program of full-time research training. within the full-time training period, research trainees who are also training as clinicians must devote their time to the proposed research training and must confine clinical duties to those that are an integral part of the research training experience. the program may not be used to support studies leading to the md, dds, or other clinical, health-professional training except when those studies are part of a formal combined research degree program, such as the md/phd. similarly, trainees may not accept nrsa support for clinical training that is part of residency training leading to clinical certification in a medical or dental specialty or subspecialty. it is permissible and encouraged, however, for clinicians to engage in nrsa-supported, full-time postdoctoral research training even when that experience is creditable toward certification by a clinical specialty or subspecialty board.short-term training is not intended, and may not be used, to support activities that would ordinarily be part of a research degree program, nor for any undergraduate-level training. short-term positions should be requested at the time of application as described in the nih grants policy statement. research training programs solely for short-term research training should not apply to this announcement, but rather the t35 nrsa foa, which can be found in the nih training kiosk.this funding opportunity announcement (foa) does not allow appointed trainees to lead an independent clinical trial, but does allow them to obtain research experience in a clinical trial led by a mentor or co-mentor. nih strongly supports training towards a career in clinically relevant research and so gaining experience in clinical trials under the guidance of a mentor or co-mentor is encouraged.nhlbi expects that the research training proposed will be directly responsive to the mission of the nhlbi. the nhlbi does not support projects primarily focused on malignancy-related research. studies that address a mechanistic correlation between cancer (i.e., lung cancer) and primary pulmonary diseases may be considered within the mission of the nhlbi. applications on vaccine development will be considered outside nhlbi's focused intent for this foa. applications on respiratory pathogens will be considered within nhlbi's intent for this foa if studies focus on the host immune response. other potential overlapping areas of interest shared by the nhlbi and other institutes/centers of the nih include myeloproliferative and myelodysplastic disorders, hematological malignancies resulting from disruptions in hematopoiesis, and the use of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and other cellular therapies. applicants are strongly encouraged to contact the nhlbi before submitting an application to determine the nhlbi programmatic appropriateness for this foa and the mission of the nhlbi.see

request a maximum project period of five years.kirschstein-nrsa awards provide stipends as a subsistence allowance to help defray living expenses during the research training experience.nih will contribute to the combined cost of tuition and fees at the rate in place at the time of award.stipend levels, as well as funding amounts for tuition and fees and the institutional allowance are announced annually in the nih guide for grants and contracts, and are also posted on the ruth l. kirschstein national research service award (nrsa) webpage.trainee travel to attend scientific meetings and workshops that the institution determines to be necessary for the individual’s research training experience is an allowable trainee expense for predoctoral and postdoctoral trainees.trainee travel to attend scientific meetings may be requested up to $1,400 per trainee per year. if the institution determines that specialized off-site training is necessary for the individual's training experience, additional funding may be requested with strong justification. for short-term trainees, the nih awarding component may provide grant funds to cover the costs of trainee travel, including attendance at scientific meetings, which the organization determines is necessary to the individual's training. trainees must be appointed to the training grant at the time of the actual travel for this to be an allowable cost.trainee travel to attend scientific meetings may be requested up to $1,400 per trainee per year. if the institution determines that specialized off-site training is

equipment, research supplies, and faculty/staff travel directly related to the research training program. the most recent levels of training related expenses are announced annually in the nih guide for grants and contracts, and are also posted on the ruth l. kirschstein national research service award (nrsa) webpage.indirect costs (also known as facilities & administrative [f&a] costs) are reimbursed at 8% of modified total direct costs (exclusive of tuition and fees, consortium costs in excess of $25,000, and expenditures for equipment), rather than on the basis of a negotiated rate agreement.higher education institutionsthe following types of higher education institutions are always encouraged to apply for nih support as public or private institutions of higher education:nonprofits other than institutions of higher educationgovernmentsotherthe sponsoring institution must assure support for the proposed program. appropriate institutional commitment to the program includes the provision of adequate staff, facilities, and educational resources that can contribute to the planned program.to be eligible for this foa, applicant institutions must (1) have an institutional mission focused on serving health disparity populations not well represented in scientific research, or institutions that have been identified by federal legislation as having an insitutional mission focused on these populations (2) serve high concentrations of students from disadvantaged backgrounds (a college or university where 20% or more of the student population receive pell grants will be accepted as an indicator of concentrated student disadvantage), and (3) have a demonstrated need for research capacity development in cardiovascular disease (including associated conditions, e.g., obesity), lung, and blood diseases and sleep disorders, as defined below.to be eligible for this foa, independent medical and graduate schools must (1) provide health care-related services to disadvantaged and underserved communities, and (2) have a need for research capacity development in cardiovascular disease (including associated conditions, e.g., obesity), lung, and blood diseases and sleep disorders. an institution where 20% or more of the institution's graduates provide health-related care to disadvantaged and underserved communities will be accepted as an indicator of service to these communities.to demonstrate need for research capacity development in heart, lung, and blood diseases and sleep disorders, applicant institutions should not have received over $1,809,000 in nih funding (direct costs) from the nhlbi per year in any of the previous five years for research training (e.g., t, f, k) and education (e.g., r25) grants in the above nhlbi mission areas.institutions meeting these eligibility criteria can assist nih in its efforts to train and recruit the most talented researchers from all groups; to improve the ability to recruit subjects from diverse backgrounds into clinical research protocols; and to improve the nation's capacity to address and eliminate health disparities.the applicant institution must have a strong and high-quality research program in the area(s) proposed under this foa and must have the requisite faculty, staff, potential trainees and facilities on site to conduct the proposed institutional program. in many cases, it is anticipated that the proposed program will complement other ongoing career development programs occurring at the applicant institution and that a substantial number of program faculty will have active research projects in which participating scholars may gain relevant experiences consistent with their research interests and goals.non-domestic (non-u.s.) entities (foreign institutions) are not eligible to apply.applicant organizationsapplicant organizations must complete and maintain the following registrations as described in the sf 424 (r&r) application guide to be eligible to apply for or receive an award. all registrations must be completed prior to the application being submitted. registration can take 6 weeks or more, so applicants should begin the registration process as soon as possible. the nih policy on late submission of grant applications states that failure to complete registrations in advance of a due date is not a valid reason for a late submission.program directors/principal investigators (pd(s)/pi(s))all pd(s)/pi(s) must have an era commons account. pd(s)/pi(s) should work with their organizational officials to either create a new account or to affiliate their existing account with the applicant organization in era commons. if the pd/pi is also the organizational signing official, they must have two distinct era commons accounts, one for each role. obtaining an era commons account can take up to 2 weeks.any individual(s) with the skills, knowledge, and resources necessary to carry out the proposed research training program as the training program director/principal investigator (training pd/pi) is invited to work with his/her organization to develop an application for support. individuals from underrepresented racial and ethnic groups as well as individuals with disabilities are always encouraged to apply for nih support.for institutions/organizations proposing multiple pds/pis, visit the multiple program director/principal investigator policy and submission details in the senior/key person profile (expanded) component of the sf 424 (r&r) application guide.the pd/pi should be an established investigator in the scientific area in which the application is targeted and capable of providing both administrative and scientific leadership to the development and implementation of the proposed program. the pd/pi will be responsible for the selection and appointment of trainees to the approved research training program, and for the overall direction, management, administration, and evaluation of the program. the pd/pi will be expected to monitor and assess the program and submit all documents and reports as required. the pd/pi has responsibility for the day to day administration of the program and is responsible for appointing members of the advisory committee (when applicable), using their recommendations to determine the appropriate allotment of funds.applicant organizations may submit more than one application, provided that each application is programmatically distinct.the nih will not accept duplicate or highly overlapping applications under review at the same time. this means that the nih will not accept:program faculty should have strong records as researchers, including recent publications and successful competition for research support in the area of the proposed research training program. program faculty should also have a record of research training, including successful, former trainees who have established productive careers relevant to the nih mission.researchers from diverse backgrounds, including racial and ethnic minorities, persons with disabilities, and women are encouraged to participate as mentors. in addition, if applicable, to complement expertise or broaden training experience, pd(s)/pi(s) are encouraged to leverage mentors/co-mentors from other institutional programs (e.g., clinical and translational science awards, ctsa). mentors should have research expertise and experience relevant to the proposed program. mentors must be committed to continue their involvement throughout the total period of the award.the individual to be trained must be a citizen or a noncitizen national of the united states or have been lawfully admitted for permanent residence at the time of appointment. additional details on citizenship, training period, and aggregate duration of support are available in the nih grants policy statement.all trainees are required to pursue their research training full time, normally defined as 40 hours per week, or as specified by the sponsoring institution in accordance with its own policies. appointments are normally made in 12-month increments, and no trainee may be appointed for less than 9 months during the initial period of appointment, except with prior approval of the awarding unit, or when trainees are appointed to approved, short-term training positions.within the 40 hours per week training period, research trainees who are also training as clinicians must devote their time to the proposed research training and must confine clinical duties to those that are an integral part of the research training experience. it is expected that institutions will seek to recruit potential trainees from diverse backgrounds, including women and individuals from groups that have been shown to be nationally underrepresented in health-related research. see, section 487(a)(4) of the public health service act and the nih notice of interest in diversity.predoctoral trainees:predoctoral trainees must be enrolled in a program leading to a phd or in an equivalent research doctoral degree program. health-professional students who wish to interrupt their studies for a year or more to engage in full-time research training before completing their formal training programs, are also eligible.postdoctoral trainees:postdoctoral trainees must have received, as of the beginning date of the nrsa appointment, a phd, md, dds, or comparable doctoral degree from an accredited domestic or foreign institution. comparable doctoral degrees include, but are not limited to, the following: dmd, dc, do, dvm, od, dpm, scd, engd, drph, dnsc, dpt, pharmd, nd (doctor of naturopathy), dsw, psyd, as well as a doctoral degree in nursing research. documentation by an authorized official of the degree-granting institution certifying all degree requirements have been met prior to the beginning date of the training appointment is acceptable. individuals in postgraduate clinical training, who wish to interrupt their studies for a year or more to engage in full-time research training before completing their formal training programs, are also eligible.the overarching goal of this t32 program is to enhance the diversity of the biomedical, behavioral and clinical research workforce by encouraging institutions to diversify their student and faculty populations to enhance the participation of individuals from diverse backgrounds, including undergraduate and health professional students from groups that are underrepresented in the biomedical, clinical, behavioral and social sciences, such as the following groups identified in the nih notice of interest in diversity (not-od-20-031): :a. individuals from racial and ethnic groups that have been shown by the national science foundation to be underrepresented in health-related sciences on a national basis (see data at http://www.nsf.gov/statistics/showpub.cfm?topid=2&subid=27) and the report women, minorities, and persons with disabilities in science and engineering). the following racial and ethnic groups have been shown to be underrepresented in biomedical research: blacks or african americans, hispanics or latinos, american indians or alaska natives, native hawaiians and other pacific islanders. in addition, it is recognized that underrepresentation can vary from setting to setting; individuals from racial or ethnic groups that can be demonstrated convincingly to be underrepresented by the grantee institution should be encouraged to participate in nih programs to enhance diversity. for more information on racial and ethnic categories and definitions, see the omb revisions to the standards for classification of federal data on race and ethnicity (https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/fr-1997-10-30/html/97-28653.htm).b. individuals with disabilities, who are defined as those with a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities, as described in the americans with disabilities act of 1990, as amended. see nsf data at, https://www.nsf.gov/statistics/2017/nsf17310/static/data/tab7-5.pdf.c. individuals from disadvantaged backgrounds, defined as those who meet two or more of the following criteria:1. were or currently are homeless, as defined by the mckinney-vento homeless assistance act (definition: https://nche.ed.gov/mckinney-vento/);2. were or currently are in the foster care system, as defined by the administration for children and families (definition: https://www.acf.hhs.gov/cb/focus-areas/foster-care);3. were eligible for the federal free and reduced lunch program for two or more years (definition: https://www.fns.usda.gov/school-meals/income-eligibility-guidelines);4. have/had no parents or legal guardians who completed a bachelor’s degree (see https://nces.ed.gov/pubs2018/2018009.pdf);5. were or currently are eligible for federal pell grants (definition: https://www2.ed.gov/programs/fpg/eligibility.html);6. received support from the special supplemental nutrition program for women, infants and children (wic) as a parent or child (definition: https://www.fns.usda.gov/wic/wic-eligibility-requirements).7. grew up in one of the following areas: a) a u.s. rural area, as designated by the health resources and services administration (hrsa) rural health grants eligibility analyzer (https://data.hrsa.gov/tools/rural-health), or b) a centers for medicare and medicaid services-designated low-income and health professional shortage areas (qualifying zipcodes are included in the file). only one of the two possibilities in #7 can be used as a criterion for the disadvantaged background definition.students from low socioeconomic (ses) status backgrounds have been shown to obtain bachelor’s and advanced degrees at significantly lower rates than students from middle and high ses groups (see https://nces.ed.gov/programs/coe/indicator_tva.asp), and are subsequently less likely to be represented in biomedical research. for background see department of education data at, https://nces.ed.gov/; https://nces.ed.gov/programs/coe/indicator_tva.asp; https://www2.ed.gov/rschstat/research/pubs/advancing-diversity-inclusion.pdf.d. literature shows that women from the above backgrounds (categories a, b, and c) face particular challenges at the graduate level and beyond in scientific fields. (see, e.g., from the nih: a systems approach to increasing the diversity of biomedical research workforce https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc5008902/).women have been shown to be underrepresented in doctorate-granting research institutions at senior faculty levels in most biomedical-relevant disciplines, and may also be underrepresented at other faculty levels in some scientific disciplines (see data from the national science foundation national center for science and engineering statistics: women, minorities, and persons with disabilities in science and engineering, special report available at https://www.nsf.gov/statistics/2017/nsf17310/, especially table 9-23, describing science, engineering, and health doctorate holders employed in universities and 4-year colleges, by broad occupation, sex, years since doctorate, and faculty rank).upon review of nsf data, and scientific discipline or field related data, nih encourages institutions to consider women for faculty-level, diversity-targeted programs to address faculty recruitment, appointment, retention or advancement.trainees selected for short-term training are required to pursue research training for 2-3 months on a full-time basis devoting at least 40 hours per week, or as specified by the sponsoring institution in accordance with its own policies. within the full-time training period, trainees must devote their time to the proposed research training and must confine clinical duties to those that are an integral part of the research training experience. successful trainees may be appointed for additional periods of short-term training or, if appropriate to their career level, they should be encouraged to apply for an extended period of full-time training supported by an nrsa training grant or fellowship, or an nih career development award.short-term training is not intended, and may not be used, to support activities that would ordinarily be part of a research degree program, nor for any undergraduate-level training.short-term trainees must be medical students, dental students, students in other health-professional programs, or graduate students in the physical or quantitative sciences. to be eligible for short-term, predoctoral research training positions students must be enrolled, in good standing, and must have completed at least one quarter or semester in a program leading to a clinical doctorate or a doctorate in a physical or quantitative science such as physics, mathematics, or engineering before participating in the training program. individuals already matriculated in a formal research degree program in the health sciences, or those holding a research doctorate, a master’s degree, or a combined health-professional/research doctorate normally are not eligible for short-term training positions. within schools of pharmacy, only individuals who are candidates for the pharmd degree are eligible for short-term, research training positions.the application forms package specific to this opportunity must be accessed through assist, grants.gov workspace or an institutional system-to-system solution. links to apply using
