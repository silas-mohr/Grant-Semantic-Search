communication in the new information ecosystem (r21 clinical trial optional)national cancer institute (nci)the purpose of this notice of special interest (nosi) is to highlight the interest of the nci’s division of cancer control and population sciences in receiving investigator-initiated applications for conducting research on the use of telehealth in cancer-related care. studies focused on populations that experience inequities in access to care and have worse cancer outcomes compared to the general population are strongly encouraged. this nosi for r01 and r21 applications is a companion announcement to the rfa titled “centers on telehealth research and cancer-related care” (rfa-ca-21-029).backgroundtelehealth encompasses a variety of clinical interactions and communication modalities. as defined by the centers for medicare and medicaid services, “telehealth, telemedicine, and related terms generally refer to the exchange of medical information from one site to another through electronic communication to improve a patient’s health.” the health resources and services administration extends this definition to include the use of telecommunications technologies to support distant clinical health care, patient and professional health-related education, public health, and health administration.telehealth interactions can occur between clinicians (i.e., provider-provider interactions) or between clinicians and patients (including interactions with family members or other caregivers of patients). telehealth interactions can also be categorized as synchronous (real-time) or asynchronous (sequential). synchronous telehealth examples include telephone calls and videoconferencing; asynchronous telehealth examples include the capture and forwarding of medical images and secure messaging. the use of telehealth has grown in recent years, and the rapid and widespread adoption of virtual visits has been facilitated by recent changes in coverage and reimbursement for telehealth. telehealth is especially helpful to patients who face transportation, logistical, or other challenges to in-person visits. telehealth can also support exchange of information and collaboration among clinicians, which is essential to providing coordinated and timely cancer-related care. the technology used for telehealth includes hardware (such as computers, cameras, mobile phones, wearable devices, and sensors) and software (such as electronic health records [ehrs], patient portals, image processing software, digital aids to support cognition and behavior change, and clinical decision support systems).research objectivesnci is interested in studies that will advance actionable knowledge on the optimal use of telehealth in support of patient and clinician interactions during the course of cancer care delivery. the scope of telehealth research encompassed by this nosi includes synchronous and asynchronous communications and other digital interactions between clinicians and patients (including family members and other caregivers) as well as communications and other digital interactions between and among clinicians. the proposed telehealth research can focus on any part of the cancer care continuum (ranging from cancer prevention to end-of-life care) for patients of all age groups in all types of care settings. telehealth studies that are implemented and tested in both pediatric and adult care settings are welcome. this research may use either observational or interventional study designs, or a combination of both.this nosi encourages research focused on patient-provider interactions including, but not limited to, studies that:this nosi also encourages research focused on provider-provider telehealth interactions including, but not limited to, studies that:studies that examine interactions at multiple levels (i.e. patient, provider, and care delivery system-level) or intervene at multiple levels are also of interest. in addition, it is important that studies use best practices for interoperability across it systems and devices and also ensure that patient privacy and confidentiality are protected as required by applicable laws and regulations.nci encourages research on populations that experience inequities in access to care, have limited access to broadband and digital technologies, have low health and/or digital literacy, and have worse cancer outcomes compared to the general population, especially those accessing care in community oncology practices, including those in rural areas or those serving under-served populations. nci also strongly encourages research that examines how telehealth can be implemented without creating or exacerbating health disparities, as well as research that examines how telehealth can be used to address health disparities and promote health equity. applications in response to this nosi should strive to advance actionable knowledge on the optimal use of telehealth in support of patient and clinician interactions during the course of cancer care delivery.r21s may support formative work to develop telehealth interventions or examine their impact in pilot studies. r01s may support projects that integrate and evaluate telehealth interventions in a cancer care delivery context. applicants are encouraged to identify the aspects of telehealth that are being tested in order to isolate their effects on variability in specified patient outcomes.applications not responsive to this foathe following types of studies are not responsive to this foa.
