institute (nci)the purpose of this notice of special interest (nosi) is to promote research focused on the development, adaptation, or integration of innovative biomaterials for cancer biology. the applications of these new materials are expected to enable new insights into basic cancer research.backgroundadvances in biomaterials have facilitated the development of biomimetic model systems and physiologically relevant assays to interrogate fundamental mechanisms of cancer biology. while much progress has been made, there remain opportunities to develop materials that better reflect the complexities of cancer environments in vivo—including adjacent healthy tissue, tumors, and tumor microenvironments—for cancer biology research applications.tissue engineered systems have substantially contributed to our understanding of cancer. the ability to control conditions in an in vitro model allows for the examination of specific pathways and cancer phenomena that is difficult when using in vivo model systems. for tissue-engineered platforms to be adopted they must be reproducible, requiring consistent manufacturing and material composition. advances in material fabrication (e.g., bioprinting, lithography, electrospinning, decellularization, and synthetic biology approaches) over the last ten years have made it possible for more researchers to design, develop, and test new materials for biomedical research. the properties of biomaterials such as hydrogels and scaffolds have been modified by chemists and material scientists to either more closely recapitulate physiological substrates or enable more precise control over culture conditions. although some novel materials have been used in model systems to mimic the properties of the surrounding tumor niche, more research and development are needed to model the complexity, heterogeneity, and evolution of tumors found in vivo.functionalization of materials to detect or respond to environmental changes would be helpful in a variety of cancer applications. materials designed to mimic the stiffness and viscoelasticity of a dynamic tumor environment more accurately would enable more insights into the varied mechanisms cancer uses to modify or create specific niches that allow for invasion or metastasis. materials that respond to changes in ph, oxygen percentage, free radical concentration, or cytokine gradients could improve monitoring and understanding of cancer initiation and progression. substances and substrates that assess or modify the immune or inflammatory response could enhance mechanistic understanding of the factors that help mitigate or exacerbate the spread of cancer.advanced development of materials that can mimic the tumor and its environment for a particular cancer necessitates a close collaboration between chemists, material scientists, physical scientists, and cancer experts. nci research programs such as the cancer tissue engineering collaborative and the innovative molecular analysis technologies (imat) program have supported scientific discovery in this area, and with the reissuance of par-22-242 bioengineering research grants (brg), the nci envisions an expanded opportunity to support early-stage development and application of innovative biomaterials for basic cancer research.research objectivesthis nosi invites applications that propose the development of advanced biomaterials for use in fundamental cancer biology research as well as proposals incorporating the novel application of advanced biomaterials to address cancer biology research questions. these biomaterials may mimic the dynamic and heterogeneous cellular and physical properties of living tissue, including in vivo tumor and tumor microenvironment, or materials may serve to induce systemic control, thus allowing more effective investigation of hypotheses within a complex system.areas of interest and potential characteristics of advanced biomaterials include, but
