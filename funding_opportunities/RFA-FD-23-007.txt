information part 2. full text of the announcementsection i. funding opportunity description section ii. award information section iii. eligibility information section iv. application and submission information section v. application review information section vi. award administration information section vii. agency contacts section viii. other informationrecent trends in marketing applications submitted to fda for oncology indications and global events have prompted fda to re-examine the role of site selection in oncology clinical trials. for example, fda is receiving growing numbers of marketing applications primarily supported by pivotal trials conducted in one country or in limited geographical areas outside of the u.s. during a recent fda oncology drug advisory committee meeting, fda discussed the applicability of the data from a single-country randomized control trial to u.s. patients and medical practice based on the use of an outdated therapeutic approach and regimens in the comparator arm, and the impact of known and unknown intrinsic and extrinsic differences in the trial population and u.s. patient population. fda also raised concerns regarding the ethics around the informed consent process in the trial.recent disruptive global events, such as the sars-cov-2 (covid-19) pandemic, and regional conflicts and wars, have introduced additional challenges to fda review of single-country or limited regional oncology clinical trials. in some cases, it has been difficult to conduct required fda clinical inspections because of travel restrictions and/or cross-border movement. this has further complicated the review of marketing applications with data collected from a single country and/or limited geographic areas in specific regions such as eastern europe.fda oce recognizes that selecting clinical trial sites has important implications for collecting comprehensive evidence to support the safety and efficacy of oncology therapeutics across the entire u.s. population, including groups that are traditionally underrepresented in clinical trials. the topic of developing strategies to improve representation of minority groups in clinical trials was addressed in a recent fda guidance, diversity plans to improve enrollment of participants from underrepresented racial and ethnic populations in clinical trials.the fda oncology center of excellence recently launched project site selection to explore these issues, and recently organized a public conversations on cancer event to initiate discussions with external stakeholders. oce seeks to engage diverse stakeholder groups in an ongoing dialogue regarding site selection for oncology clinical trials, including key international regulatory partners, oncology advocacy groups, bioethicists, academic oncologists, patients, regulators, and pharmaceutical companies. fda’s ultimate goal is to identify options and strategies to ensure that oncology clinical development programs generate the highest quality data collected in an ethical manner that is applicable to the u.s. population and medical practice.project site selection may complement other ongoing fda oce initiatives aimed at improving racial and ethnic equity in oncology clinical trial enrolment and data collection under the auspices of the fda oce’s project equity (https://www.fda.gov/about-fda/oncology-center-excellence/project-equity). careful pre-planning of the selection of oncology clinical trial sites may help improve clinical trial access of racial and ethnic minorities as well as other patient demographic subgroups that have been historically under-represented in oncology clinical trials but who often disproportionately bear the burden of such cancers.the purpose of this foa is to support a series of conferences and workshops developed with substantial fda input to explore challenges regarding clinical trial site selection in studies that are submitted to fda for regulatory approval of oncology indications.foa objectivesthis foa is intended to support the development of a series of workshops and conferences in close collaboration with fda staff that will address the following objectives:see section viii. other information for award authorities and regulations.cooperative agreement: a support mechanism used when there will be

https://www.hhs.gov/civil-rights/for-individuals/nondiscrimination/index.htmlhhs recognizes that research projects are often limited in scope for many reasons that are nondiscriminatory, such as the principal investigator’s scientific interest, funding limitations, recruitment requirements, and other considerations. thus, criteria in research protocols that target or exclude certain populations are warranted where nondiscriminatory justifications establish that such criteria are appropriate with respect to the health or safety of the subjects, the scientific study design, or the purpose of the research. for additional guidance regarding how the provisions apply to fda grant programs, please contact the scientific/research contact that is identified in section vii under agency contacts

defense authorization act of fiscal year 2009 (public law 110-417), fda awards will be subject to the federal awardee performance and integrity information system (fapiis) requirements. fapiis requires federal award making officials to review and consider information about an applicant in the designated integrity and performance system (currently fapiis) prior to making an award. an applicant, at its option, may review information in the designated integrity and performance systems accessible through fapiis and comment on any information about itself that a federal agency previously entered and is currently in fapiis. the federal awarding agency will consider any comments by the applicant, in addition to other information in fapiis, in making a judgement about the

“federal awarding agency review of risk posed by applicants.” this provision will apply to all fda grants and cooperative agreements.fda considers the sharing of research resources developed through fda-sponsored research an important means to enhance the value and further the advancement of research. when research resources have been developed with fda funds and the associated research findings published, those findings must be made readily available to the scientific community.upon acceptance for publication, scientific researchers must submit the author’s final manuscript of the peer-reviewed scientific publication resulting from research supported in whole or in part with fda funds to the nih national library of medicine's (nlm) pubmed central (pmc). fda defines the author's
