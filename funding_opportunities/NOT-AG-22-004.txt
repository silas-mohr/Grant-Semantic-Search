complex integrated multi-component projects in aging research (u19 clinical trial optional)national institute on aging (nia)the purpose of this notice of special interest (nosi) is to highlight that the national institute on aging (nia) is interested in receiving grant applications focused on pain, pain management, and opioids related to aging or older adults and within nia’s mission areas. this nosi invites research applications that focus on improving the understanding of mechanisms underlying pain experience with aging; enhancing assessment, prevention, and management strategies for pain in older adults; and improving health equity of aging populations suffering with pain. new applications, resubmissions, competing renewals, and competing revisions to existing awards are all encouraged through this nosi. for administrative supplements focused on pain, pain management, and opioids related to aging or older adults and within nia’s mission areas, please see not-ag-22-005.backgroundthe u.s. population is aging. in 2019, there were 54 million americans ages 65 and older, or 19% of the u.s. population. by 2040, older adults will number 81 million, or 21% of the population. the global population is also aging, with expected increase in the world’s older adult population of 2.5-fold by 2050. prevalence of chronic pain is disproportionately higher in older adults, in part because age is a leading risk factor for many painful conditions. an estimated 65% of older adults report chronic pain, and causes of pain and pain of different types increase with age. in addition, older adults with pain may face reduced independence and social isolation, which can further contribute to their pain and comorbid health concerns. considerations such as comorbidities, polypharmacy (with associated risk of drug interactions), age-related changes in drug metabolism, medication adherence, and adverse reactions contribute to the complexity of pain management in later life. additionally, cognitive impairment, such as alzheimer’s disease (ad) and alzheimer’s disease-related dementias (adrd), may complicate accurate assessment of pain.research objectivesthe specific research objective of this nosi is to expand the scientific knowledge base of mechanisms, assessment, treatment, and outcomes of pain and pain-related conditions in aging humans and animal models. nia welcomes basic and translational research and research training applications that fall within nia’s mission to support genetic, biological, clinical, behavioral, social, and economic research on aging. both new data collection and analyses of existing datasets are welcome. leveraging of ongoing cohorts, intervention studies, networks, data and specimen repositories, model systems, and other existing research resources and infrastructure is encouraged. study designs may include mechanistic studies, observational approaches, quasi-experimental designs, and interventional studies. nia encourages applicants to address priorities outlined in the nia health disparities research framework.this nosi encourages grant applications focused on aging-related studies of pain, pain management, and opioids including, but not limited to, these overarching topic areas:investigators interested in analyses of existing datasets may consider using nia-supported observational and interventional studies such as those listed with the aging research biobank and nia’s research resources page. see also not-ag-21-020.investigators interested in studying pain in animal models may consider nia’s aging rodent colonies.nia-supported research centers may be particularly useful for accessing recruitment resources, analytic capabilities, specimens, specialized expertise, and other aging-related research resources. more information about each of these centers programs can be found at their respective links: alzheimer's disease research centers, centers on the demography and economics of aging, claude d. pepper older americans independence centers, edward r. roybal centers for translation research in the behavioral and social sciences of aging, resource centers for minority aging research, nia ad/adrd health care systems research collaboratory, and the artificial intelligence and technology collaboratories for aging. coordination among all of nia's centers programs is facilitated through the nia research centers collaborative network.application and submission informationthis notice applies to application receipt dates on or after february 5, 2022 and subsequent receipt dates through january 7, 2025.submit applications for this initiative using one of the following funding opportunity announcements (foas) or any reissues of these announcements.pa-20-163 -
