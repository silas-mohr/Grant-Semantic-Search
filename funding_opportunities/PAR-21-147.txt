par-19-219 - maximizing access to research careers (t34)par-21-147not applicableonly one application per institution is allowed, as defined in section iii. 3. additional information on eligibility.93.859the goal of the maximizing access to research careers (marc) program is to develop a diverse pool of undergraduates who complete their baccalaureate degree, and transition into and complete biomedical, research-focused higher degree programs (e.g., ph.d. or m.d./ph.d.). this funding opportunity announcement (foa) provides support to eligible, domestic institutions to develop and implement effective, evidence-informed approaches to biomedical training and mentoring that will keep pace with the rapid evolution of the research enterprise. nigms expects that the proposed research training programs will incorporate didactic, research, mentoring, and career development elements to prepare trainees for the completion of research-focused higher degree programs in biomedical fields. this program is limited to applications from training programs at baccalaureate degree-granting research-intensive institutions (i.e., those with an average of nih research project grant funding greater than or equal to $7.5 million total costs over the last 3 fiscal years).this funding opportunity announcement (foa) does not allow appointed trainees to lead an independent clinical trial but does allow them to obtain research experience in a clinical trial led by a mentor or co-mentor.february 23, 2021april 26, 2021not applicablemay 26, 2021; may 26, 2022; may 26, 2023all

award administration information section vii. agency contacts section viii. other informationthe overall goal of the nih ruth l. kirschstein national research service award (nrsa) program is to help ensure that a diverse pool of highly trained scientists is available in appropriate scientific disciplines to address the nation's biomedical, behavioral, and clinical research needs. in order to accomplish this goal, nrsa training programs are designed to train individuals to conduct research and to prepare for research careers. more information about nrsa programs may be found at the ruth l. kirschstein national research service award (nrsa) website.the nrsa program has been the primary means of supporting predoctoral and postdoctoral research training programs since enactment of the nrsa legislation in 1974. each program should provide high-quality research training, mentored research experiences, and additional training opportunities that equip trainees with the technical (e.g., appropriate methods, technologies, and quantitative/computational approaches), operational (e.g., independent knowledge acquisition, rigorous experimental design and interpretation of data) and professional (e.g., management, leadership, communication, and teamwork) skills required for careers in the biomedical research workforce.the national institutes of health (nih) recognizes the need to diversify the scientific workforce by enhancing the participation of individuals from groups identified as underrepresented in the biomedical, clinical, behavioral and social sciences (collectively termed "biomedical") research workforce. research shows that diverse teams working together and capitalizing on innovative ideas and distinct perspectives outperform homogenous teams. scientists and trainees from diverse backgrounds and life experiences bring different perspectives, creativity, and individual interests to address complex scientific problems. there are many benefits that flow from a diverse nih-supported scientific workforce, including fostering scientific innovation, enhancing global competitiveness, contributing to robust learning environments, improving the quality of research, enhancing public trust, and increasing the likelihood that health disparities and the needs of underserved populations are addressed in biomedical research.nigms strives to ensure that future generations of researchers will be drawn from the entire pool of talented individuals, bringing different aptitudes, perspectives, interests, and experiences to address complex scientific problems. nigms seeks to enhance the diversity of the biomedical research workforce by supporting individuals from a variety of backgrounds at multiple training and career stages in a variety of institutions and educational settings across the country. accordingly, nigms developed separate institutional eligibility tracks for review and funding of its undergraduate and graduate diversity enhancing programs based on nih research project grant (rpg) funding levels. the two tracks include research-intensive, i.e., those with an average of nih rpg funding greater than or equal to $7.5 million total costs per year over the past 3 fiscal years, and research-active, i.e., those with an average of rpg funding less than $7.5 million total costs per year over the past 3 fiscal years (rpg data are available through nih reporter). to prevent the duplication of diversity enhancing nigms programs, each institution will be eligible for one diversity enhancing undergraduate program (either maximizing access to research careers, marc, or undergraduate research training initiative for student enhancement, u-rise) regardless of the activity code (r25 or t34), and one diversity enhancing graduate program (either the initiative to maximize student development, imsd, or graduate research training initiative for student enhancement, g-rise) regardless of the activity code (r25 or t32). institutions with marc, u-rise, imsd or g-rise are eligible to participate in the bridges to the baccalaureate and/or bridges to the doctorate programs provided other eligibility requirements are met.in spite of recent advances, individuals from certain groups and backgrounds are underrepresented in the biomedical sciences research workforce as described in nih's interest in diversity. the severity of the underrepresentation of these groups increases throughout the training stages. for example in 2017, students from certain racial and ethnic groups, including blacks or african americans, hispanics or latinos, american indians or alaska natives, native hawaiians and other pacific islanders comprised ~35 percent of the college age population, but earned only ~25 percent of bachelor’s degrees and ~16 percent of ph.d. degrees in science and engineering (national center for science and engineering statistics). additionally, while the united states has seen a significant increase in the number of ph.d. degrees in the biomedical sciences earned by scientists from groups underrepresented in the biomedical research workforce, a corresponding increase in the ranks of the faculty in basic science departments at medical schools has not occurred (gibbs, et al., 2016, elife 2016, 5:e21393; valantine, lund & gammie, cbe-life sciences education, 2016, 15:fe4).several reports (see for example, acd working group on diversity in the biomedical workforce, 2012; pcast report, 2012; from college to careers: fostering inclusion of persons with disabilities in stem, 2014; and increasing college opportunity for low income students, 2014) recommend supporting programs that strive to recruit, train, and mentor students from underrepresented groups who have an interest in science, technology, engineering and math (stem) as a means to effectively build a diverse and competitive scientific workforce.this foa is intended to enable the community to develop and implement evidence-informed approaches to biomedical research training and mentoring to enhance diversity in the biomedical research workforce. the president's council of advisors on science and technology (pcast) report provided evidence that financial concerns and a deficit of peers from similar backgrounds can erode self-confidence and the will to remain in stem majors (pcast report, 2012). nigms diversity enhancing institutional training grants offset the cost of appointed trainee stipends, tuition and fees, and training related expenses, including health insurance, in accordance with the approved nih support levels. additionally, funded programs are expected to provide activities that will build a strong cohort of research-oriented individuals while enhancing the science identity, self-efficacy, and a sense of belonging among the cohort members. programmatic activities include, but are not limited to, providing authentic research experiences, academic enhancements, skills development, and additional mentoring - activities proven to increase persistence in stem fields (cited in pcast report, 2012 and graduate stem education for the 21st century, 2018). each program should provide high-quality training that equips individuals with the technical (e.g., appropriate methods, technologies, and quantitative/computational approaches), operational (e.g., independent knowledge acquisition, rigorous experimental design, and interpretation of data, conducting research in the safest manner possible) and professional (e.g., management, leadership, communication, and teamwork) skills required for careers in the biomedical research workforce. funded programs are expected to promote inclusive research environments (i.e., institutional and departmental environments where trainees from all backgrounds feel integrated into and supported by the biomedical research community).the overarching objective of the maximizing access to research careers program is to develop a diverse pool of undergraduates who complete their baccalaureate degree and transition into and complete biomedical, research-focused higher degree programs (e.g., ph.d. or m.d./ph.d.). the long-term goal is to develop a diverse pool of well-trained biomedical scientists, who have the following technical, operational, and professional skills:diversity at all levels—from the kinds of science to the regions in which it is conducted to the backgrounds of the people conducting it— contributes to excellence in research training environments and strengthens the research enterprise. this foa is intended to support outstanding research training programs that will enhance diversity at all levels. as part of a larger initiative to enhance diversity, the marc program will support trainees who are earning a baccalaureate degree at research-intensive institutions and who intend to complete a biomedical research higher degree program (e.g., ph.d., or m.d./ph.d.).nigms intends to fund applications that propose feasible academic and research focused training programs that will enhance diversity in the biomedical workforce. applicants are expected to identify training objectives (i.e., specific, measurable, and obtainable outcomes the program intends to achieve) and to develop plans to implement evidence-informed training and mentoring activities that are grounded in the literature and from evaluations of existing relevant programs. program objectives must align with the overarching goal of the marc diversity enhancing program. funded programs are expected to provide evidence of accomplishing the training objectives in progress reports and when applying for renewal, to make training and career outcomes publicly available, and are strongly encouraged to disseminate successful training practices to the broader community.institutional commitment and support for the proposed training program are important elements of the application. the marc program may complement and synergize with other ongoing federally-supported predoctoral research training programs at the applicant institution (e.g., in the development of skills needed for careers in the biomedical research workforce); however, the marc program goals and activities to achieve those goals must be distinct from related programs currently receiving federal support at the same institution. in cases where an institution has multiple nigms training grants, it is expected that these programs will seek to create administrative and training efficiencies to reduce costs and improve trainee services and outcomes. the training grant should be well integrated within one or more department(s)/program(s) and should exert a strong, positive influence on the development and execution of the outreach and recruitment of potential trainees, curriculum, training opportunities, and mentoring. training grant funds may not be used solely as a vehicle to provide stipends for trainees to conduct research.training grants are usually awarded for five years. the grant offsets the cost of stipends, tuition and fees, and training related expenses, including health insurance, for the appointed trainees in accordance with the approved nih support levels. trainees are typically provided full-time support for two to three years of undergraduate studies. use of training grant support in the final three years of undergraduate research training is strongly encouraged to allow for the participation in research, training, mentoring, professional development, and cohort-building activities that will prepare the trainees to successfully transition into a biomedical, research-focused higher degree program (e.g., ph.d. or m.d./ph.d.).this foa does not allow appointed trainees to lead an independent clinical trial but does allow them to obtain research experience in a clinical trial led by a mentor or co-mentor. nih strongly supports training towards a career in clinically relevant research and so gaining experience in clinical trials under the guidance of a mentor or co-mentor is encouraged.see section viii. other information for award authorities and regulations.grant: a support mechanism providing money, property, or both to an eligible entity to carry out an approved project or activity.new renewal of grants funded through par-19-219 resubmissionthe oer glossary and the sf424 (r&r) application guide provide details on these application types. only those application types listed here are allowed for this foa.not allowed: only accepting applications that do not propose clinical trialsnote: appointed trainees are permitted to obtain research experience in a clinical trial led by a mentor or co-mentor.need help determining whether you are doing a clinical trial?the number of awards is contingent upon nih appropriations and the submission of a sufficient number of meritorious applications.application budgets should reflect the actual needs of the proposed project.recipients are expected to be familiar with and comply with applicable cost policies and the nrsa guidelines (nih grants policy statement - institutional research training grants). funds may be used only for those expenses that are directly related to and necessary for the research training and must be expended in conformance with omb cost principles, the nih grants policy statement, and the nrsa regulations, policies, guidelines, and conditions set forth in this document.awards may be for project periods up to five years in duration and are renewable.kirschstein-nrsa awards provide stipends as a subsistence allowance to help defray living expenses during the research training experience. nih will contribute to the combined cost of tuition and fees at the rate in place at the time of award. stipend levels, as well as funding amounts for tuition and fees and the institutional allowance are announced annually in the nih guide for grants and contracts, and are also posted on the ruth l. kirschstein national research service award (nrsa) webpage.nigms recognizes the need of trainees to attend scientific meetings and/or training events, and to build professional networks. nigms will provide up to $1,000 per trainee per year for scientific meetings or research training experiences that will enhance scientific development, build science identity, create a sense of belonging in the scientific community, and build professional networks. plans for trainee travel should be well justified. for marc-supported institutions outside the continental united states, $1,250 for travel per trainee per year will be provided.trainees are required to spend at least one summer in a research training experience. preferred sites are research-intensive graduate institutions such as those with nih t32 training programs. funds for the summer research experience will be provided as follows: $3,000 per marc trainee, to be used in accordance with the institutional policies as a per diem for a period of up to ten weeks; and an additional $500 for travel to and from the host research training.nigms provides funds for the summer research training experience for up to 50% of the awarded number of marc trainees at the time a competing award is made. for additional budget guidance on the marc summer research requirement, see t34 summer research experience policy. additional funds will not be provided for students continuing the research training at the host institution.plans for trainee travel should be well justified. foreign travel is not allowed.nigms will provide funds to help defray other research training expenses, such as health insurance, staff salaries, consultant costs, equipment, research supplies, and faculty/staff travel directly related to the research training program.the total amount of training related expenses (tre) that may be requested is limited to a maximum of $8,000/trainee/year. the maximum cap for the tre portion of a proposed marc budget is $250,000/year.allowable costs include those associated with the following:indirect costs (also known as facilities & administrative [f&a] costs) are reimbursed at 8% of modified total direct costs (exclusive of tuition and fees, consortium costs in excess of $25,000, and expenditures for equipment), rather than on the basis of a negotiated rate agreement.nih grants policies as described in the nih grants policy statement will apply to the applications submitted and awards made from this foa.higher education institutionsthe following types of higher education institutions are always encouraged to apply for nih support as public or private institutions of higher education:nonprofits other than institutions of higher educationgovernmentsotherfor diversity enhancing programs, nigms recognizes separate institutional eligibility tracks: research-intensive, i.e., those with an average of nih research project grant (rpg) funding greater than or equal to $7.5 million total costs per year over the past 3 fiscal years, and research-active, i.e., those with an average of rpg funding less than $7.5 million total costs per year over the past 3 fiscal years (rpg data are available through nih reporter). for example, fy 2018, fy 2019 and fy 2020 for applications submitted in may 2021.institutional eligibility for this foa is limited to baccalaureate degree-granting research-intensive institutions as defined above. research-active institutions are not eligible to apply for or receive marc grants. to prevent the duplication of nigms diversity enhancing programs, each institution is eligible for one undergraduate program (either marc or u-rise) regardless of the activity code (r25 or t34), and one graduate program (either imsd or g-rise) regardless of the activity code (r25 or t32). institutions with nigms marc, u-rise, imsd, or g-rise funding are eligible for the bridges to the baccalaureate and/or bridges to the doctorate programs provided the other eligibility criteria are met. applicants are encouraged to consult nigms staff to discuss eligibility prior to submission.an institution funded through the u-rise or marc program that changes category due to changes in research project grant funding during the grant cycle should apply to the appropriate program based on their eligibility at the time of renewal. programs that change category will report on the programs outcomes of the prior funding period(s), up to 15 years, using the appropriate tables.the sponsoring institution must assure support for the proposed program. appropriate institutional commitment to the program should be detailed in the institutional support letter in the letters of support attachment. additionally, a signed letter is required from the provost or similar official with institution-wide responsibility verifying the eligibility of the applicant institution at the time of application submission according to the eligibility criteria indicated above. see the application instructions for the required “letters of support” instructions in section iv.non-domestic (non-u.s.) entities (foreign institutions) are not eligible to apply.non-domestic (non-u.s.) components of u.s. organizations are not eligible to apply.applicant organizationsapplicant organizations must complete and maintain the following registrations as described in the sf 424 (r&r) application guide to be eligible to apply for or receive an award. all registrations must be completed prior to the application being submitted. registration can take 6 weeks or more, so applicants should begin the registration process as soon as possible. the nih policy on late submission of grant applications states that failure to complete registrations in advance of a due date is not a valid reason for a late submission.program directors/principal investigators (pd(s)/pi(s))all pd(s)/pi(s) must have an era commons account. pd(s)/pi(s) should work with their organizational officials to either create a new account or to affiliate their existing account with the applicant organization in era commons. if the pd/pi is also the organizational signing official, they must have two distinct era commons accounts, one for each role. obtaining an era commons account can take up to 2 weeks.any individual(s) with the skills, knowledge, and resources necessary to carry out the proposed research training program as the training program director/principal investigator (training pd/pi) is invited to work with his/her organization to develop an application for support. individuals from underrepresented racial and ethnic groups as well as individuals with disabilities are always encouraged to apply for nih support. for institutions/organizations proposing multiple pds/pis, visit the multiple program director/principal investigator policy and submission details in the senior/key person profile (expanded) component of the sf 424 (r&r) application guide.as described in the instructions for the training program director(s)/principal investigator(s) (pd(s)/pi(s)) in section iv.2 below, nigms encourages multiple pds/pis, particularly when each brings a unique perspective and skill set that will enhance training. at least one of the training pd(s)/pi(s) should be an established investigator in the biomedical sciences and capable of providing both administrative and scientific leadership to the development and implementation of the proposed program. additional pds/pis, including individuals with experience in the science of education, relevant social science disciplines, program evaluation, mentoring, and university administration may be included to achieve the training goals. any of the pds/pis may serve as the contact pd/pi. the contact pd/pi is expected to have a full-time appointment at the applicant institution unless extremely well-justified. if the full-time status of the contact pd/pi changes after the award, the institution must obtain prior program approval to appoint a new pd/pi or request a deviation from the full-time rule. the pd(s)/pi(s) will be responsible for the selection and appointment of trainees to the approved research training program, and for the overall direction, management, administration, and evaluation of the program. the pd(s)/pi(s) will be expected to monitor and assess the program and submit all documents and reports as required. the pd(s)/pi(s) have responsibility for the day-to-day administration of the program and are responsible for appointing members of the advisory committee (when applicable) and using their recommendations to determine the appropriate allotment of funds.this foa does not require cost sharing as defined in the nih grants policy statement.nigms will accept only one application per institution, typically defined by a unique identifier, such as duns and an nih institution profile file (ipf) number.the nih will not accept duplicate or highly overlapping applications under review at the same time. this means that the nih will not accept:the selected faculty should be active researchers in the biomedical sciences as demonstrated by recent publications and research support. when building a training team, programs should include faculty who are committed to training, mentoring, and providing supportive and inclusive research environments. programs are encouraged to build a diverse team of preceptors/mentors that includes, for example, faculty from underrepresented groups (see notice of nih's interest in diversity) and faculty at different career stages (i.e., early-career as well as established faculty).the individual to be trained must be a citizen or a noncitizen national of the united states or have been lawfully admitted for permanent residence at the time of appointment. additional details on citizenship, training period, and aggregate duration of support are available in the nih grants policy statement.trainees should be research-oriented individuals enrolled in a major leading to a baccalaureate degree in a stem discipline that will prepare the trainee for a biomedical, research-focused higher degree program (e.g., ph.d. or m.d./ph.d.). all trainees are required to pursue their research training full time as specified by the sponsoring institution in accordance with its own policies. appointments are normally made in 12-month increments for 2-3 years, and no trainee may be appointed for less than 9 months during the initial period of appointment, except with prior approval of the nih awarding unit.the application forms package specific to this opportunity must be accessed through assist, grants.gov workspace or an institutional system-to-system solution.

research reproducibility including, at a minimum, evaluation of foundational research underlying a project, rigorous experimental design and data analysis, consideration of relevant biological variables such as sex, authentication of key biological and/or chemical resources, data and material sharing, record keeping, and transparency in reporting? are the rigor and transparency components sufficiently well integrated into the overall curriculum? are they taught at multiple stages of trainee development and in a variety of formats and contexts? does the teaching synergize with elements of the curriculum designed to enhance trainees' abilities to conduct responsible research? is there evidence that all participating faculty reiterate and augment key elements of methods for enhancing reproducibility when trainees are performing mentored research their laboratories? the plan will be rated as acceptable or unacceptable, and the summary statement will provide the consensus of the review committee.recruitment plan to enhance diversityreviewers will examine the strategies to be used in the recruitment of prospective individuals from underrepresented groups. the plan will be rated as acceptable or unacceptable, and the consensus of the review committee will be included in an administrative note in the summary statement.training in the responsible conduct of researchall applications for support under this foa must include a plan to fulfill nih requirements for instruction in the responsible conduct of research (rcr). taking into account the specific characteristics of the training program, the level of trainee experience, and the particular circumstances of the trainees, the reviewers will evaluate the adequacy of the proposed rcr training in relation to the following five required components: 1) format - does the plan satisfactorily address the format of instruction, e.g. lectures, coursework and/or real-time discussion groups, including face-to-face interaction? (a plan involving only on-line instruction is not acceptable); 2) subject matter – does the plan include a sufficiently broad selection of subject matter, such as conflict of interest, authorship, data management, human subjects and animal use, laboratory safety, research misconduct, and research ethics? 3) faculty participation - does the plan adequately describe how faculty will participate in the instruction? for renewal applications, are all training faculty who served as course directors, speakers, lecturers, and/or discussion leaders during the past project period named in the application? 4) duration of instruction - does the plan meet the minimum requirements for rcr, i.e., at least eight contact hours of instruction? 5) frequency of instruction – does the plan meet the minimum requirements for rcr, i.e., at least once during each career stage (undergraduate, post-baccalaureate, predoctoral, postdoctoral, and faculty levels) and at a frequency of no less than once every four years?are the rcr components sufficiently well integrated into the overall curriculum? are they taught at multiple stages of trainee development and in a variety of formats and contexts? does the teaching of rcr synergize with elements of the curriculum designed to enhance trainees' abilities to conduct rigorous and reproducible research? is there evidence that all participating faculty reiterate and augment key elements of responsible conduct when trainees are performing mentored research their laboratories?plans and past record will be rated as acceptable or unacceptable,
