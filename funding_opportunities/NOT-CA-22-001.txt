2) develop pre-clinical models and methods to identify potential adverse cardiovascular outcomes in drug development studies; 3) differentiate and quantify characteristics associated with short- and long-term cardiotoxicity; 4) develop and test methods to detect early-onset cardiovascular dysfunction; and 5) develop, test, and evaluate novel approaches to prevention, management, and care coordination strategies for cardiotoxicity.research objectivesnci and nhlbi are interested in grant applications with oncology and cardiology collaborative approaches that address the research gaps as outlined in shelburne, et al. 2014 and 2019. applications addressing pediatric and adult needs are of interest. these include, but are not limited to, those that:responsiveness for both nci and nhlbinhlbiapplication and submission informationthis notice applies to due dates on or after february 5, 2022, and subsequent receipt dates through november 06, 2024.submit applications for this initiative using the following funding opportunity announcement (foa) or any reissues of these announcements through the expiration date of this notice:all instructions in the sf424 (r&r) application guide and the funding opportunity announcement used for submission must be followed, with the following additions:applications nonresponsive to terms of this nosi will not be considered for the nosi initiative.scientific/research contactsnonniekaye shelburne, ms, crnp, aocn national cancer institute (nci) telephone: 240-276-6897 email: nshelburne@mail.nih.govbishow b. adhikari national heart, lung, and blood institute (nhlbi) phone: (301) 435-0504 e-mail: adhikarb@nhlbi.nih.govpeer review contact(s) examine your era commons account for review assignment and contact information (information appears two weeks after the submission due date).financial/grants management contact(s)crystal wolfrey national cancer institute (nci) telephone: 240-276-6277 email: wolfreyc@mail.nih.govfatima kamara national heart, lung, and blood institute (nhlbi) phone (301) 435-7916 email: fatima.kamara@nih.govweekly toc for this announcement nih funding opportunities and noticesnote: for help accessing pdf, rtf, ms word, excel, powerpoint, audio or video files, see help downloading files.
