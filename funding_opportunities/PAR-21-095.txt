and/or 2) redirect their research programs in new trajectories; and/or 3) catalyze research collaborations in new research directions. it is expected that this initiative will lead to new and/or augmented research programs competitive for nih funding.the objective of the nidcd research career enhancement award for established investigators (k18) program is to provide support for experienced scientists to remain current in state-of-the-art techniques, evolving technologies, and the fundamental, translational, and clinical research frontiers related to the hearing, balance, smell, taste, voice, speech, and language sciences. established investigators often express an urgent need for compensated protected time and mentored training to augment their research capabilities and to keep their research programs in-step with emerging technologies and evolving scientific frontiers and, thereby, competitive for continued nih funding. this initiative provides candidates with protected time and mentored guidance to augment or redirect their research career trajectories within the nidcd research mission. it focuses on established investigators holding the academic rank of associate professor or professor, or the equivalent in non-academic research settings, who have records of scientific accomplishment and independent research support (past and/or present). the purpose of this foa is to provide such investigators with support for short-term, intensive periods of mentored research experience over a period of six- to twenty-four months to acquire new research capabilities in the study of hearing, balance, smell, taste, voice, speech, or language sciences. such experiences, typically undertaken during an academic sabbatical year, will afford candidate investigators protected time to: 1) enrich and expand their expertise and research programs through retooling in new techniques, emerging technologies, and/or scientific areas; 2) redirect their research programs in new trajectories within the nidcd scientific mission; and/or 3) catalyze research collaborations in new research directions. it is expected that this initiative will lead to new and augmented research programs competitive for nih funding. in addition to serving as a short-term career development vehicle for investigators within the nidcd extramural research community, this program is also intended for investigators working outside of the hearing, balance, smell, taste, voice, speech, and language sciences who wish to add research direction within the nidcd scientific mission to their overall research programsthe research career enhancement experience shall take place in a host laboratory, whether in the applicant institution (i.e., in which the candidate holds his/her primary appointment) or in another institution with the appropriate resources to provide the proposed research career development experience. in both cases, the tutelage of a well-qualified host/mentor (or team of mentors/hosts) is required. in most cases, the applicant and proposed mentor(s) and host laboratory will not have had previous research collaborations.the research career development experience proposed must have the potential to substantially augment the research capabilities of the candidate at the applicant institution, and provide new research opportunities and benefits that would not be achievable through a collaborative research grant with the mentor(s). the research career enhancement experience should be tailored to the individual needs and level of experience of the candidate, and will generally incorporate two components: 1) didactic (e.g., directed study/tutorials, semester-long courses, short courses, seminar series, journal clubs) and/or laboratory-based instruction in the new discipline, techniques or technologies; and, 2) a small-scale research project in the host laboratory. the laboratory experience may comprise fundamental, translational or clinical/patient-oriented research (including epidemiologic, outcomes and health services research).note: this funding opportunity announcement (foa) is designed specifically for candidates proposing research that does not involve leading an independent clinical trial, a clinical trial feasibility study, or an ancillary study to a clinical trial. under this foa candidates are permitted to propose research experience in a clinical trial led by a mentor or co-mentor. those proposing a clinical trial or an ancillary study to an ongoing clinical trial as lead investigator, should apply to the companion foa (par-21-094) and those proposing basic human studies should apply to the companion foa par-21-096.nih defines a clinical trial as "a research study in which one or more human subjects are prospectively assigned to one or more interventions (which may include placebo or other control) to evaluate the effects of those interventions on health-related biomedical or behavioral outcomes." (not-od-15-015).nih not only supports trials of safety and efficacy, it also supports mechanistic exploratory studies that meet the definition of a clinical trial and are designed to explore or understand a biological or behavioral process, the pathophysiology of a disease, or the mechanism of action of an intervention. these studies may focus on basic and/or translational discovery research in healthy human subjects and in human subjects who are affected by the pathophysiology of diseases and disorders. by addressing basic questions and concepts in biology, behavior, and pathophysiology, these studies may provide insight into understanding human diseases and disorders along with potential treatments or preventive strategies. nih also supports biomarker studies that meet the definition of a clinical trial and that may provide information about physiological function, target engagement of novel therapeutics, and/or the impact of therapeutics on treatment response. nih thus supports studies that meet the definition of clinical trials (as noted above) but do not seek to establish safety, clinical efficacy, effectiveness, clinical management, and/or implementation of preventive, therapeutic, and services interventions.special note: prospective applicants are strongly encouraged to consult with nidcd staff well in advance to make sure their applications meet the institute's programmatic interests.see section viii. other information for award authorities and regulations.grant: a support mechanism providing money, property, or both to an eligible entity to carry out an approved project or activity.the oer glossary and the sf424 (r&r) application guide provide details on these application types.note: applicants may propose to gain experience in a clinical trial led by a mentor/co-mentor as part of their research career development.need help determining whether you are doing a clinical trial?the number of awards is contingent upon nih appropriations and the submission of a sufficient number of meritorious applications.nidcd anticipates funding 3 to 5 awards, corresponding to a total of $600,000 per year.generally the research experience shall span a contiguous period of six months to two years.nidcd will contribute up to to the legislatively mandated salary cap in effect at the time of award per year toward the salary of the career award recipient. further guidance on budgeting for career development salaries is provided in the sf424 (r&r) application guide. see also not-od-17-094.the total nih contribution to salary, however, may not exceed the legislatively mandated salary cap. see: http://grants.nih.gov/grants/policy/salcap_summary.htm.nidcd will contribute $ 40,000 per year toward the research development costs of the award recipient, which must be justified and consistent with the stage of development of the candidate and the proportion of time to be spent in research or career development activities. these funds may be used for the following expenses: (a) tuition and fees related to career development; (b) research-related expenses, such as supplies, equipment and technical personnel; c) travel to research meetings or training; and (d) statistical services including personnel and computer time.salary for mentors, secretarial and administrative assistants, etc. is not allowed.higher education institutionsthe

permanent resident card uscis form i-551, or other legal verification of such status).applicant organizations may submit more than one application, provided that each application is scientifically distinct, and each is from a different candidate.the nih will not accept duplicate or highly overlapping applications under review at the same time. an individual may not have two or more competing nih career development applications pending review concurrently. in addition, nih will not accept:at the time of award, the candidate must have a "full-time" appointment at the academic institution that is the applicant organization. the candidate is required to devote at least 6 calendar months (50% of full-time professional effort) to the k18 program, but may devote their full-time (12 calendar months) effort to it. for information regarding nih policy on determining full-time professional effort for career awards, see not-od-04-056. the allowance for a part-time commitment of professional effort will enable candidates to hold their ongoing research grants (if applicable) and/or meet their academic responsibilities in a limited capacity, and in accordance with nih policy, as they pursue the career enhancement program. however, the total effort cannot exceed 100%, and all other activities must be consistent with the goals of the k18 award. generally, the research experience shall span a contiguous period of six months to two years. however, a six-month research experience may be apportioned over two successive summer semesters (of three months each), provided the experience is pursued on a full-time (100%) basis during these periods.mentor(s)before submitting the application, the candidate must identify a mentor who will supervise the proposed career development and research experience. the mentor should be an active investigator in the area of the proposed research and be committed both to the career development of the candidate and to the direct supervision of the candidate’s research. the mentor must document the availability of sufficient research support and facilities for high-quality research. candidates are encouraged to identify more

are warranted where nondiscriminatory justifications establish that such criteria are appropriate with respect to the health or safety of the subjects, the scientific study design, or the purpose of the research. for additional guidance regarding how the provisions apply to nih grant programs, please contact the scientific/research contact that is identified in section vii under agency contacts
