the fragile families and well-being study (ffws, https://fragilefamilies.princeton.edu/); the national longitudinal study of youth 1979 (nlsy79, https://www.nlsinfo.org/content/cohorts/nlsy79); and the panel study of income dynamics (psid, https://psidonline.isr.umich.edu/). another example is the national death index (ndi, https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/ndi/index.htm) (researchers interested in using the ndi should refer to not-od-20-057, notice of information: national death index linkage access for nih-supported investigators, https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/not-od-20-057.html). other examples include existing disease and condition registries such as those listed below, as well as relevant studies in the nichd dash data repository (https://dash.nichd.nih.gov/):.research on increasing disparities in deaths due to suicide, homicide, motor vehicle crashes, and other intentional and unintentional injury causes is encouraged.methodological research on improving accuracy of mortality and cause and manner of death data, along with the accuracy of other data needed to identify disparities in mortality is within scope.examples of topics within the scope of this initiative include, but are not limited, to:research areas that are not within the scope of this nosi:applicants are strongly encouraged to discuss potential applications with the scientific/research contact listed below before submitting their application.application and submission informationthis notice applies to due dates on or after june 5, 2023 and subsequent receipt dates through september 8, 2024.submit applications for this initiative using one of the following funding opportunity announcements (foas) or any reissues of these announcement through the expiration date of this notice.all instructions in the sf424 (r&r) application guide and the funding opportunity announcement used for submission must be followed, with the following additions:applications nonresponsive to terms of this nosi will not be considered for the nosi initiative.scientific/research contact(s)juanita j. chinn, phd eunice kennedy shriver national institute of child health and human development (nichd) telephone: 301-827-4901 email: juanita.chinn@nih.govweekly toc for this announcement nih funding opportunities and noticesnote: for help accessing pdf, rtf, ms word, excel, powerpoint, audio or video files, see help downloading files.
