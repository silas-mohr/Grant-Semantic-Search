announcement (foa) encourages applications that propose planning, design, and preparation of documentation necessary for implementation of investigator-initiated clinical trials.a clinical trial is defined by nih as: “a research study in which one or more human subjects are prospectively assigned to one or more interventions (which may include placebo or other control) to evaluate the effects of those interventions on health-related biomedical or behavioral outcomes."- see more at https://grants.nih.gov/policy/clinical-trials/definition.htm. in addition, any research study that will require regulatory oversight [e.g. investigational new drug (ind) or investigations device exemption (ide)] is within the scope of this foa.the niaid clinical trial planning grant will support planning for clinical trials that address high-priority research questions related to the mission and goals of the niaid. sufficient pre-clinical data to support the planning of the clinical trial should be available prior to submission of the r34 grant application. the trials should be hypothesis-driven and milestone-defined.the niaid clinical trial planning grant is not a prerequisite for submission of a r01, u01 or u44 application for implementation of investigator-initiated clinical trials.backgroundover the past three years, niaid committed over $5.5 billion to clinical research, of which $2.5 billion was devoted to clinical trials and supportive activities. clinical trials are one research strategy niaid uses to improve the understanding of the clinical mechanisms of infectious, immunologic, and allergic diseases or to improve prevention, diagnosis, and treatment. for additional information about the mission, strategic plan, and research interests of the niaid, applicants are encouraged to consult the niaid web site https://www.niaid.nih.gov/research/role.niaid supported clinical trials and infrastructureniaid supports clinical trial infrastructure and networks through a variety of funding mechanisms focused on high-priority disease research areas. examples include the hiv/aids clinical trial networks supported by the division of aids (https://www.niaid.nih.gov/research/hivaids-clinical-trials-networks), the division of microbiology and infectious diseases clinical trials programs and networks (https://www.niaid.nih.gov/research/networks?keyword=&division=12), and the immune tolerance network supported by the division of allergy, immunology and transplantation (http://www.immunetolerance.org/). niaid's clinical research infrastructure includes clinical, coordinating, statistical, and data centers, as well as central laboratories and other specialized resources.investigator-initiated clinical trialsthe niaid clinical trial planning grant is available to support planning activities associated with either high-risk or non-high-risk clinical trials. the niaid clinical trial planning grant is not a prerequisite for any unsolicited niaid clinical trial award. a planning grant is designed to: (1) permit early peer review of the rationale for the proposed clinical trial; (2) permit assessment of the design/protocol of the proposed trial in a preliminary form; (3) provide support for the development of a complete study protocol and associated documents, including a manual of operations and (4) support the development of other essential elements of a clinical trial. if a clinical trial is ready for implementation and readiness is adequately supported by documentation, submission of an r01, u01 or u44 application may occur. note that funding of the clinical trial planning grant does not guarantee or imply funding of a subsequent niaid clinical trial.scopethe niaid clinical trial planning grant supports timely development of all materials required for implementation of the future clinical trial. awards made under this foa will
