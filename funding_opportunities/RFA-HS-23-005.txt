iii. eligibility information section iv. application and submission information section v. application review information section vi. award administration information section vii. agency contacts section viii. other informationpurposethe purpose of this initiative is to support the development of scalable knowledge on how to increase the uptake of evidence-based interventions to prevent, diagnose, and treat sud in the context of person-centered care delivered in primary care. the initiative will fund up to 4 projects to produce evidence on effective models of care and strategies to implement effective treatments that will lead to sustainable changes in care delivery and develop lasting partnerships between primary care and other care settings. applicants will be required to describe the approach and strategies for implementation, how they will evaluate the intervention, how the intervention will improve health equity, and plans for sustainability.definitions of key termsbackgroundin response to the sharp rise in opioid related deaths over the past decade, the federal government mobilized research, policy, and programs to address opioid over-prescription and access to substance use treatment, with some success. there has been a marked fall in total opioid prescriptions and a measurable increase in evidence-based screening and use of medications for opioid use disorder (moud):[1]despite these efforts, drug overdose deaths continue to increase (1).[2]furthermore, access to treatment has been slower to extend to racial and ethnic minorities, and to rural communities, intensifying existing inequities in health outcomes (2).[3]while covid exacerbated these trends, the trends were apparent well before the covid pandemic and are likely to continue after the pandemic has abated (3).there are several reasons the substance use disorder crisis has been so difficult to control. although we have medications and other treatments that work, uptake of these treatments into routine care, especially for those who need them the most, has been slow. there are insufficient specialty clinics to meet the demand and primary care clinics continue to encounter many barriers in integrating moud and other evidence-based treatments into regular care, including access to behavioral health services and expertise when needed. the initial targeted focus on opioid use disorder and opioid prescribing has not addressed the evolving nature of the substance use disorder (sud) crisis, which now includes increasing rates of stimulant and polysubstance use. although there is growing appreciation for the social, environmental and psychological causes that underlie addiction, finding ways to address them in routine care remains challenging. in order to break the cycle of increasing morbidity and mortality, hhs has recognized the need for a new holistic person-centered strategy (4). this entails providing patient-centered care that addresses co-existing health needs, social circumstances with linkages to community resources and services.increasing the capacity of primary care and other ambulatory settings to prevent, diagnose, and manage sud and to provide integrated coordinated care in response to sud referrals from in-patient and emergency setting can help address some of the core issues that have frustrated prior efforts to address america’s growing substance use disorder problem. there are evidence-based models of integrated behavioral health in primary care using collaborative and stepped care models that can provide the foundation for improving care delivery for sud. the covid-19 pandemic has also provided an opportunity to test how innovative digital health solutions including telemedicine and mhealth could be leveraged to increase access and optimize care. this nofo will accelerate the movement of evidence-based treatments into routine care by testing strategies and models to improve the capacity of primary care and ambulatory care settings to provide evidence-based, patient-centered care for people who misuse opioids and other multiple substances across the life course. this nofo seeks applications that build on recent research on effective treatments, lead to lasting changes in how care is delivered, and develop lasting partnerships between primary care and other care settings. applications will be required to describe how they will assess implementation, how the intervention will improve health equity, and plans for sustainability.objectivesapplicants must describe the intervention and how it will be integrated into ongoing person-centered primary care, the sud prevention or treatment need it addresses, preliminary data to support the feasibility of the intervention, document that it is currently underutilized, and explain why expanding its use in primary care would improve patient outcomes and achieve other goals such as equity, accessibility, and efficiency.applicants must describe their approach for engaging stakeholders in intervention design and implementation, identifying barriers to adoption and designing an implementation plan to address them, how the intervention will be tailored to local needs, resources and populations served, and a strategy for sustainability and scale. their approach must address the following requirements:applicants are also encouraged to work with existing networks, such as practice-based research networks (pbrns) and quality initiatives to increase the likelihood of success. letters of support are required.see section viii. other information for award authorities and regulations.grant: a support mechanism providing money, property, or both to an eligible entity to carry out an approved project or activity.newthe oer glossary

doing a clinical trial?ahrq plans to invest up to $2.5 million total costs annually over 4 years to support up to 4 awards. the number of awards is contingent upon the availability of funds and the submission of a sufficient number of meritorious applications. future year funding is contingent upon the availability of funds for each year of support.because the nature and scope of the proposed research will vary from application to application it is anticipated that the size and duration of each award will also vary.the total costs (direct and indirect) for a project awarded under this nofo will not exceed $625,000 in any given year and $2.5 million for the entire project period.funds may be used only for those expenses that are directly related and necessary to the project and must be expended in compliance with applicable uniform administrative requirements, cost principles, and audit requirements for hhs awards (45 cfr part 75) and the hhs grants policy statement.the project period may not exceed 4 yearsthese projects are being funded pursuant to 42 u.s.c. 299a, which provides that ahrq shall conduct and support research, support demonstration projects, and disseminate information on health care and on systems for the delivery of such care, including activities with respect to the quality, effectiveness, efficiency, appropriateness, and value of health care services.all applications submitted and ahrq grants made in response to this nofo are subject to 45 cfr part 75 (uniform administrative requirements, cost principles and audit requirements for hhs awards; https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?node=pt45.1.75), the hhs grants policy statement (see https://www.ahrq.gov/funding/policies/hhspolicy/index.html), and the terms and conditions set forth in the notice of award.higher education institutionsthe following types of higher education institutions are always encouraged to apply for nih support as public or private institutions of higher education:nonprofits other than institutions of higher educationlocal governmentsfederal governmentsotherahrq's authorizing legislation does not allow for-profit organizations to be eligible to lead applications under this research mechanism. for-profit organizations may participate in projects as members of consortia or as subcontractors only. because the purpose of this program is to improve healthcare in the united states, foreign institutions may participate in projects as members of consortia or as subcontractors only. applications submitted by for-profit organizations or foreign institutions will not be reviewed. organizations described in section 501(c) 4 of the internal revenue code that engage in lobbying are not eligible.hhs grants policy requires that the grant recipient perform a substantive role in the conduct of the planned project or program activity and not merely serve as a conduit of funds to another party or parties. if consortium/contractual activities represent a significant portion of the overall project, the applicant must justify why the applicant organization, rather than the party(s) performing this portion of the overall project, should be the recipient and what substantive role the applicant organization will play. justification can be provided in the specific aims or research strategy section of the phs398 research plan component sections of the sf424 (r&r) application. there is no budget allocation guideline for determining substantial involvement; determination of substantial involvement is based on a review of the primary project activities for which grant support is provided and the organization(s) that will be performing those activities.non-domestic (non-u.s.) entities (foreign institutions) are not eligible to apply.non-domestic (non-u.s.) components of u.s. organizations are not eligible to apply.applicant organizationsapplicant organizations must complete and maintain the following registrations as described in the sf 424 (r&r) application guide to be eligible to apply for or receive an award. all registrations must be completed prior to the application being submitted. registration can take 6 weeks or more, so applicants should begin the registration process as soon as possible.program directors/principal investigators (pd(s)/pi(s))all pd(s)/pi(s) must have an era commons account. pd(s)/pi(s) should work with their organizational officials to either create a new account or to affiliate their existing account with the applicant organization in era commons. if the pd/pi is also the organizational signing official, they must have two distinct era commons accounts, one for each role. obtaining an era commons account can take up to 2 weeks.note: after january 25, 2022, all individuals listed on the r&r senior/key person profile (expanded) form are required to have an era commons username (commons id). see

they have time to make any application corrections that might be necessary for successful submission. when a submission date falls on a weekend or federal holiday, the application deadline is automatically extended to the next business day.organizations must submit applications to grants.gov (the online portal to find and apply for grants across all federal agencies). applicants must then complete the submission process by tracking the status of the application in the era commons, nih’s electronic system for grants administration. nih and grants.gov systems check the application against many of the application instructions upon submission. errors must be corrected and a changed/corrected application must be submitted to grants.gov on or before the application due date and time. if a changed/corrected application is submitted after the deadline, the application will be considered late.applicants are responsible for viewing their application before the due date in the era commons to ensure accurate and successful submission.information on the submission process and a definition of on-time submission are provided in the sf424 (r&r) application guide.this initiative is not subject to intergovernmental review.for efficient grant administration, ahrq grant administration procedures will be used and conducted in accordance with the terms and conditions, cost principles, and other considerations described in the hhs grants policy statement. the hhs grants policy statement can be found at http://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/grants/grants/policies-regulations/hhsgps107.pdf.pre-award costs are allowable. a recipient may, at its own risk and without ahrq prior approval, incur obligations and expenditures to cover costs up to 90 days before the beginning date of the initial budget period of a new award if such costs are necessary to conduct the project and would be allowable under the grant, if awarded, without ahrq prior approval. if specific expenditures would otherwise require prior approval, the recipient must obtain ahrq approval before incurring the cost. ahrq prior approval is required for any costs to be incurred more than 90 days before the beginning date of the initial budget period of a new award.the incurrence of pre-award costs in anticipation of a competing or non-competing award imposes no obligation on ahrq either to make the award or to increase the amount of the approved budget if an award is made for less than the amount anticipated and is inadequate to cover the pre-award costs incurred. ahrq expects the recipient to be fully aware that pre-award costs result in borrowing against future support and that such borrowing must not impair the recipient's ability to accomplish the project objectives in the approved time frame or in any way adversely affect the conduct of the project.applications must be submitted electronically

rejected if it does not comply with these requirements.applicants are required to follow the instructions for post-submission materials, as described in not-od-19-083 (https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/not-od-19-083.html. any instructions provided here are in addition to the instructions in the policy.priority populationsahrq is committed to the inclusion of priority populations in health services research. the overall portfolio of health services research that ahrq conducts and supports shall include the populations specifically named in ahrq’s authorizing legislation: inner city; rural; low income; minority; women; children; elderly; and those with special health care needs, including those who have disabilities, need chronic care, or need end-of-life health care. 42 u.s.c. 299(c)(1). ahrq also includes in its definition of priority populations those groups identified in section 2(a) of executive order 13985 as members of underserved communities: black, latino, and indigenous and native american persons, asian americans and pacific islanders and other persons of color; members of religious minorities; lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (lgbtq+) persons; persons with disabilities; persons who live in rural areas; and persons otherwise adversely affected by persistent poverty or inequality.ahrq will broadly implement this inclusion policy across the research that ahrq supports and conducts so that the portfolio of research is inclusive of all populations. ahrq intends that these populations be included in studies such that the research design explicitly allows conduct of valid analyses. the policy applies to all grant applications. investigators should review the document entitled, “ahrq policy on the inclusion of priority populations,” which is available at https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/not-hs-21-015.html. applicants under this nofo should consider and discuss including priority populations in research design as specified in this notice.public access to ahrq-funded scientific publicationsinvestigators should review the document titled ‘ahrq announces new policy for public access to ahrq-funded scientific publications’, which is available at (http://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/not-hs-16-008.html). for all research arising from ahrq support, this policy requires that ahrq-funded authors submit an electronic version of the author’s final peer-reviewed accepted manuscript to the national library of medicine's pubmed central (pmc) to be made publicly available within 12 months of the publisher’s date of publication.ahrq data management plan policyinvestigators should review the document titled ahrq data management plan (dmp) policy, which is available at (https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/not-hs-20-011.html). this policy requires applicants for ahrq new/competing grants and research contracts to include a dmp for managing, storing, and disseminating the primary data, samples, physical collections, and other supporting materials created or gathered in the course of research funded by ahrq, or state why data management is not possible, as a component of their grant application or research contract proposal.plan for sharing research datathe precise content of the data-sharing plan will vary, depending on the data being collected and how the investigator is planning to share the data. applicants who are planning to share data should describe briefly the expected schedule for data sharing; the format of the final dataset; the documentation to be provided; whether or not any analytic tools also will be provided; whether or not a data-sharing agreement will be required and, if so, a brief description of such an agreement (including the criteria for deciding who can receive the data and whether or not any conditions will be placed on their use); and the mode of data sharing (e.g., under its own auspices by mailing a disk or posting data on its institutional or personal website or through a data archive or enclave). investigators choosing to share under their own auspices may wish to enter into a data-sharing agreement. references to data sharing may also be appropriate in other sections of the application.the reasonableness of the data sharing plan or the rationale for not sharing research data will be assessed by the reviewers. however, reviewers will not factor the proposed data sharing plan into the determination of scientific merit or the priority score.data confidentialitythe ahrq confidentiality statute, 42 usc 299c-3(c), requires that information that is obtained in the course of ahrq supported activities and that identifies individuals or establishments be used only for the purpose for which it was supplied. information that is obtained in the course of ahrq-supported activities and that identifies an individual may be published or released only with the consent of the individual who supplied the information or is described in it. there are civil monetary penalties for violation of the confidentiality provision of the ahrq statute. 42 usc 299c-3(d). in the human subjects section of the application, applicants must describe procedures for ensuring the confidentiality of the identifying information to be collected (see not-hs-18-012: confidentiality in ahrq-supported research). the description of the procedures should include a discussion of who will be permitted access to this information, both raw data and machine-readable files, and how personal identifiers and other identifying or identifiable data will be restricted and safeguarded. identifiable patient health information collected by recipient under this rfa will also be obtained and managed in accordance with the hipaa privacy rule, 45 cfr parts 160 and 164.the recipient should ensure that computer systems containing confidential data have a level and scope of security that equals or exceeds that established by the hipaa security rules if applicable (see hipaa website in prior paragraph) and that established by the office of management and budget (omb) in omb circular no. a-130, appendix iii - security of federal automated information systems. the applicability and intended means of applying these confidentiality and security standards to subcontractors and vendors, if any, should be addressed in the application.sharing research resources: rights in dataunless otherwise provided in grant awards, ahrq recipients may copyright, or seek patents for, as appropriate, final and interim products and materials developed in whole or in part with ahrq support, including, but not limited to, methodological tools, measures, software with documentation, literature searches, and analyses. such copyrights and patents are subject to a royalty-free, non-exclusive, and irrevocable ahrq license to reproduce, publish, use or disseminate for any purpose consistent with ahrq’s statutory responsibilities and to authorize others to do so for any purpose consistent with ahrq’s statutory responsibilities. in accordance with its legislative dissemination mandate, ahrq purposes may include, subject to statutory confidentiality protections, making project materials, databases, results, and algorithms available for verification or replication by other researchers. in addition, subject to ahrq budget constraints, final products may be made available to the health care community and the public by ahrq or its agents if such distribution would significantly increase access to a product and thereby produce substantial or valuable public health benefits. ordinarily, to accomplish distribution, ahrq publicizes research findings but relies on recipients to publish research results in peer-reviewed journals and to market grant-supported products. ahrq requests that recipients notify the office of communications (oc) when an ahrq-funded research article has been accepted for publication in a peer-reviewed journal. researchers should submit manuscripts that have been accepted for publication in a peer-reviewed journal to journalpublishing@ahrq.hhs.gov at least four to six weeks in advance of the journal’s expected publication date.regulations applicable to ahrq recipients concerning intangible rights and copyright can be found at 45 cfr 75.322.the mission of ahrq is to produce evidence to make health care safer, higher quality, more accessible, equitable, and affordable, and to work with the u.s. department of health and human services (hhs) and other partners to make sure that the evidence is understood and used.ahrq's priority areas of focus are detailed here: https://www.ahrq.gov/funding/policies/nofoguidance/index.html.as part of this mission, applications are submitted to ahrq to support health services research which are evaluated for scientific and technical merit through the ahrq peer review system.applications that are complete and responsive to the nofo will be evaluated for scientific and technical merit by an appropriate objective group

below, will be considered in the review process.reviewers will provide an overall impact score to reflect their assessment of the likelihood for the project to exert a sustained, powerful influence on the research field(s) involved, in consideration of the following review criteria and additional review criteria (as applicable for the project proposed).reviewers will consider each of the review criteria below in the determination of scientific merit and give a separate score for each. an application does not need to be strong in all categories to be judged likely to have major scientific impact. for example, a project that by its nature is not innovative may be essential to advance a field.does the project address an important problem or a critical barrier to progress in the field? is the prior research that serves as the key support for the proposed project rigorous? if the aims of the project are achieved, how will scientific knowledge, technical capability, and/or clinical practice be improved? how will successful completion of the aims change the concepts, methods, technologies, treatments, services, or preventative interventions that drive this field? is the proposed project likely to result in increased dissemination and implementation of evidence-based practices for screening, prevention or management of sud directly to primary care practices or improve the capacity of primary care practices to collaborate with other settings in the identification and management of sud? will it address inequities in access to and outcomes of sud diagnosis and treatment associated with race and ethnicity, socioeconomic status, income, sex and age?are the pd(s)/pi(s), collaborators, and other researchers well suited to the project? if established, have they demonstrated an ongoing record of accomplishments that have advanced their field(s)? if the project is collaborative or multi-pd/pi, do the investigators have complementary and integrated expertise; are their leadership approach, governance, and organizational structure appropriate for the project? is the single pd/pi, or are the multiple pd(s)/pi(s) combined, devoting at least 20% annual full-time effort (i.e., at least 8 hours per week) in each given year of the project? are the total hours described for all other key personnel appropriate to the level of effort required for the performance of their responsibilities? are letters of support included for collaborating organizations?does the application challenge and seek to shift current research or clinical practice paradigms by utilizing novel theoretical concepts, approaches or methodologies, instrumentation, or interventions? are the concepts, approaches or methodologies, instrumentation, or interventions novel to one field of research or novel in a broad sense? is a refinement, improvement, or new application of theoretical concepts, approaches or methodologies, instrumentation, or interventions proposed?are the overall strategy, methodology, and analyses well-reasoned and appropriate to accomplish the specific aims of the project? have the investigators included plans to address weaknesses in the rigor of prior research that serves as the key support for the proposed project? have the investigators presented strategies to ensure a robust and unbiased approach, as appropriate for the work proposed? are potential problems, alternative strategies, and benchmarks for success presented? if the project is in the early stages of development, will the strategy establish feasibility and will particularly risky aspects be managed?if the project involves human subjects and/or clinical research, are the plans to address1) the protection of human subjects from research risks, and2) inclusion (or exclusion) of individuals on the basis of sex/gender, race, and ethnicity, as well as the inclusion or exclusion of individuals of all ages (including children and older adults), justified in terms of the scientific goals and research strategy proposed?will the scientific environment in which the work will be done contribute to the probability of success? are the institutional support, equipment, and other physical resources available to the investigators adequate for the project proposed? will the project benefit from unique features of the scientific environment, subject populations, or collaborative arrangements?as applicable for the project proposed, reviewers will evaluate the following additional items while determining scientific and technical merit, and in providing an overall impact score, but will not give separate scores for these items.for research that involves human subjects but does not involve one of the categories of research that are exempt under 45 cfr part 46, the committee will evaluate the justification for involvement of human subjects and the proposed protections from research risk relating to their participation according to the following five review criteria: 1) risk to subjects, 2) adequacy of protection against risks, 3) potential benefits to the subjects and others, 4) importance of the knowledge to be gained, and 5) data and safety monitoring for clinical trials.for research that involves human subjects and meets the criteria for one or more of the categories of research that are exempt under 45 cfr part 46, the committee will evaluate: 1)
