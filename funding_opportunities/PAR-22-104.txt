you must use one of these submission options to access the application forms for this opportunity.the overall goal of the nih ruth l. kirschstein national research service award (nrsa) program is to help ensure that a diverse pool of highly trained scientists is available in appropriate scientific disciplines to address the nation's biomedical, behavioral, and clinical research needs. in order to accomplish this goal, nrsa training programs are designed to train individuals to conduct research and to prepare for research careers. more information about nrsa programs may be found at the ruth l. kirschstein national research service award (nrsa) website.purpose and background informationthe nrsa program has been the primary means of supporting predoctoral and postdoctoral research training programs since enactment of the nrsa legislation in 1974. research training activities can be in basic biomedical or clinical sciences, in behavioral or social sciences, in health services research, or in any other discipline relevant to the nih mission.institutional nrsa programs allow the training program director/principal investigator (training pd/pi) to select the trainees and develop a program of coursework, research experiences, and technical and/or professional skills development appropriate for the selected trainees. each program should provide high-quality research training and offer opportunities in addition to conducting mentored research. the grant offsets the cost of stipends, tuition and fees, and training related expenses, including health insurance, for the appointed trainees in accordance with agency-approved support levels.note: this funding opportunity announcement (foa) allows support appointment of trainees (d43) proposing to serve as the lead investigator of an independent clinical trial; or proposing a separate ancillary clinical trial; or proposing to gain research experience in a clinical trial led by another investigator, as part of their research and career development.backgroundchronic non-communicable diseases and disorders (ncds) are steadily increasing around the world, including in low and middle-income countries (lmics), and will soon account for more than 50% of the expenditures for health care and more than 60% of the disability adjusted life years (dalys). the world health organization (who) has endorsed a global action plan for the prevention and control of ncds that includes the promotion and support of national capacity for high-quality research and health system development. to address these goals, in-country research expertise is needed to identify research questions, needs and gaps about the burden, causes, prevention, treatment and long-term care of ncds within regional and local contexts. advancing research on prevention and control of the dual burden of communicable and non-communicable diseases and disabilities is a key goal of the most recent fic strategic plan http://www.fic.nih.gov/about/pages/strategic-plan.aspx.purposethe fogarty international center (fic), together with the participating institutes centers and offices: national institute of mental health (nimh), national institute of neurological disorders and stroke (ninds), national center for complementary and integrative health (nccih), national institute of dental and craniofacial research (nidcr), national institute on alcohol abuse and alcoholism (niaaa), office of womens health research (orwh), and office of disease prevention (odp), encourages applications for the chronic, non-communicable diseases and disorders across the lifespan: fogarty international research training award (ncd-lifespan) d43 program for institutional research training programs in low- and middle-income countries (lmics, as defined by the world bank classification system). the application must propose a collaborative research training program in an lmic involving either a u.s. institution and institution(s) in an lmic or applications developed and submitted directly by lmic institutions with substantial research and research training program experience to work with lmic institutions with less capacity.programs must sustainably strengthen the capacity of lmic institutions and investigators to conduct research on ncds. sustainable ncd research capacity is known to require a critical mass of scientists and health research professionals with in-depth scientific expertise and complementary leadership skills that enable them to conduct independent, internationally recognized ncd research relevant to the health priorities of their country. this ncd-lifespan program supports institutional research training awards for training programs designed to strengthen the capacity of the lmic institution(s) to support independent research through the education and career development of individual researchers and key personnel. the trainees are expected to contribute to the research capacity in the lmic upon completion of their training.new research training programs are expected to focus on collaboration with a single lmic institution as the major partner unless that collaboration for research training is already well-established at the lmic site to the extent that outreach to other sites can be well-justified. the ultimate goal is for the lmics to run their own research training programs so all applications originating from the us institution must include plans to transition research training capabilities and management to the foreign site over the course of the grant period. renewal applications from the us institution must also justify the continued need for leadership by the us awardee institution. applicants with well-established programs at the lmic site may reach out to form research training networks to develop the research capacity of other lmic institutions.the long-range goal is to provide a solid foundation in lmics for development and implementation of evidence-based interventions, relevant to ncd's across the lifespan. sufficient evidence may exist upon which to base research for interventions and implementation strategies. however, often the evidence base is not well developed or not relevant to the given country or culture. therefore, training across the spectrum of research disciplines is encouraged as needed, from basic biomedical, behavioral and social science to clinical and applied sciences, including translational and implementation science that emphasizes the resources, context and needs of multiple stakeholders in local settings.special program objectives and considerationsthe objectives of the ncd-lifespan research training program are:all applications to this program should have a central ncds across the lifespan-related theme or focus although the theme may be as narrow or broad as deemed appropriate for the goals outlined in the foa.the specific ncds that may be addressed must be relevant to the stated interests of the participating nih institutes, centers and offices (see "specific interests of the foa sponsors" section).research training programs are especially encouraged:the programs are expected to both support trainees to conduct research and, as appropriate and needed, to go beyond traditional training models to develop multifaceted and novel training paradigms targeted to the special needs of lmic investigators and institutions.where well-established research and/or research training programs exist in lmic institutions, proposals for research training hubs and networks within countries and/or regions are encouraged.the need for a multidisciplinary approach:risk factors for ncds are complex and differentially amenable to control. environmental influences, trauma, infection, lifestyle factors, diverse socio-economic influences and epigenetic changes interact with underlying genetic vulnerability to influence the trajectory and severity of many ncds.increasing evidence for the prenatal and childhood roots of chronic ncds provide possible avenues for early prevention of and intervention for ncds. during the past several decades, improvements in health care have led to a decrease in child mortality and an increase in life expectancy in lmics. however, many of the factors that previously contributed to early mortality remain and influence later health outcomes. these positive trends have, therefore, set the stage for a complex epidemiology of health and disease as more children survive into adulthood predisposed by early disease, malnutrition and adverse environmental and psychological influences and experiences to later development of chronic diseases such as cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease, diabetes, cancer, mental illness, substance abuse, developmental, neurological and neurodegenerative diseases and disorders.during the remainder of the lifecycle, social and environmental factors such as environmental pollutants and chronic stress continue to influence health. however, individual behaviors and exposures such as physical inactivity, poor diet, tobacco, alcohol and drug abuse become increasingly important risk factors influencing the trajectory of ncds. it is critical to develop a deeper understanding of the complex motivations that contribute to decision making and risky behavior in resource poor settings.in addition to generating evidence to prevent and treat chronic ncds, the research findings must be incorporated into community practice in an efficient and timely manner. because of the formidable gap between innovations in health and their delivery to communities, another goal of the fic strategic plan is to "bridge the training gap in implementation research." implementation research is the scientific study of methods to promote the integration of research findings and evidence-based interventions into health care policy and practice with a greater emphasis on the resources and context of local care settings and the needs of multiple stakeholders. training researchers in the field of implementation science is strongly encouraged as part of research training programs under this foa.the factors that are responsible for onset and prevention of chronic disease are complex, so trainees must gain a broad appreciation for the need for research across health disciplines that may encompass genetics, medicine, nutrition, psychology, behavioral health, epidemiology, population studies, health law, environmental health, and public health, as well as many disciplines not traditionally associated with health research such as business administration, economics, urban planning, information science, communications, organizational and management theory, finance, individual and systems-level behavioral change, statistics, anthropology, learning theory, and marketing. while no one trainee can acquire expertise in all these fields, training might include development of team projects that include trainees from multiple fields of expertise and provide experience in collaborative interdisciplinary team research.types of training:in the context of this foa, "trainees" are individuals from the host/target lmic(s) eligible for research training under this foa and according to the applicant's proposed selection criteria.the proposed training is expected to strengthen sustainable research and research training capacity at the lmic institution. the program application should incorporate an appropriate mix of long-, medium- and short-term training opportunities and in-country mentored research to address the research training needs for ncds identified for the lmic. applicants are encouraged to design multi- and inter-disciplinary research training programs and teams.training can take place in the u.s. or lmic, with the goal for most of the training to occur within the lmic by the end of the initial grant award period. applications involving already existing research training collaborations under other programs at the same lmic sites are expected to begin with a substantial level of research training within the lmic that takes advantage of the research training infrastructure already created (such as faculty and courses). training-related research should always be carried out in the lmic. in addition to early career short-, medium- and long-term training, mid-career training is also allowed. the actual training mix should be justified according to the assessed needs and already existing infrastructure and the level of research capacity and training infrastructure in the lmic.for example:while innovative research training models for ncds are encouraged, typically research training programs involve the following:additional institutional capacity-building efforts are encouraged. these may include, but are not limited to, in-country training workshops in advanced techniques; distance learning; and interaction with other national and regional efforts to strengthen the ability of institutions to identify and undertake successful research and research training in ncds to influence teaching, implementation and country policy.trainee researchproposed research training can take place in the u.s. or a foreign country, but training-related research should be carried out in the lmic.scientific research training for clinicians and healthcare professionals including physicians, nurses, dentists, social work professionals and other practitioners is encouraged.it is expected that lmic trainees will disseminate the results of their research at scientific conferences and in peer-reviewed publications.advanced in-country mentored research may be undertaken by the trainee in his/her home country upon completion of his/her initial period of long-term training under the program (master's, ph.d., post-doctoral or other long-term training) and may be supported by the training program.all training-related research projects in which trainees are involved under this award must be independently peer-reviewed through scientific review procedures established by the applicant institution, and have written evidence of documentation of education in the protection of human subjects for the trainee, compliance with the required federal citations, and approval from an institutional (or ethical) review board or committee at the applicant institution and, if different, at the lmic institution in which the research is being conducted.where appropriate, the design of training-related research projects should account for potential sex and gender differences that may affect the questions asked and the analyses performed. these might include different responses to and impacts of health interventions, differences in physiology, and different behavioral bases for disease prevention strategies.this ncd-lifespan program strongly encourages principal investigator/program directors (pis/pds) to include individuals from diverse backgrounds, including women and other individuals from groups underrepresented in biomedical and behavioral research in the country (including individuals from racial, ethnic and socially disadvantaged backgrounds and those living with disabilities), as faculty and research trainees at all sites.specific interests of the foa sponsorsnih institutes and centers (ics) participating in this announcement will consider applications for funding. because of the differences in individual institute and center (ic) program interests for this foa, prospective applicants should carefully note which ics participate in this announcement and view their respective areas of research interest and requirements below. applicants can obtain additional information and research interests for each of the foa's sponsoring partners at their websites and by contacting the partner program official listed in this announcement (section vii. agency contacts).nih ic partner intereststhe fogarty international center (fic) is interested in all eligible applications relevant to its mission. however, fic is most interested in and will prioritize research training applications that 1) cover multiple ncd areas/topics and/or co-morbid conditions and risk factors across the lifespan 2) train in research disciplines applicable across ncd areas/topics, conditions and settings (for example, but not limited to, training in epidemiology, demographics, genetics/epigenetics, bioinformatics, biomedical engineering, health technology and prevention, translation, implementation and clinical research). for both new and renewal applications fic will prioritize direct applications from the lmic site for funding consideration. the fic strategic plan (http://www.fic.nih.gov/about/pages/strategic-plan.aspx) states the following relevant goals: 1) build research capacity through individuals, institutions, and networks to meet future and evolving global health challenges; 2) stimulate innovation in the development and implementation of technologies and other locally relevant solutions to address global health problems; 3) support research and research training in implementation science; 4) advance research on prevention and control of the dual burden of communicable and non-communicable diseases and disabilities; and 5) build and strengthen partnerships to advance global health research and research capacity.the national institute of neurological disorders and stroke (ninds) is interested in supporting innovative research training programs for basic, mechanistic, epidemiological, prevention, translational and clinical research across the spectrum of neurological, neuromuscular and neurovascular diseases and disorders. in addition to prevalent neurological disorders and stroke, ninds is also interested in supporting research in areas of rare and neglected neurological diseases that are relevant to low- and middle- income countries (ninds disorder index http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/disorder_index.htm).the ninds strongly encourages training in scientific rigor and experimental design. trainees should have a thorough understanding of the principles and practices of rigorous scientific research. these principles should be examined in the context of the collection, appropriate analysis and interpretation of scientific data. programs are also encouraged to provide education in human decision-making tendencies and cognitive biases, and how they can lead to erroneous interpretation of data (c.f. kahneman, d. 2011 thinking, fast and slow. new york. farrar, straus and giroux). programs are expected to provide formal instruction in the principles of rigorous experimental design to ensure that trainees understand the practices required for robust hypothesis testing and the application of these principles and practices to their individual research (see: ninds rigor resources: https://www.ninds.nih.gov/current-research/trans-agency-activities/rigor-transparency/rigorchampionsandresources).the national center for complementary and integrative health (nccih) is interested in supporting training programs investigating the use of complementary approaches for chronic, non-communicable diseases and disorders, for which these approaches are most frequently used. these would include, but not be limited to, investigations of the impact of complementary health modalities in alleviating chronic pain syndromes and inflammatory processes, and improving health and wellness. complementary health approaches of interest to nccih include both mind-body and natural product approaches. training programs can propose secondary data analyses, non-interventional, observational, or epidemiological clinical research, or basic mechanistic and non-clinical translational research. nccih will not support training programs proposing interventional clinical trial research through this foa. applicants are strongly encouraged to contact nccih program staff prior to submission.the national institute of mental health (nimh) is interested in training programs that provide education in state-of-the-art research skills (e.g., novel study designs, data analytic and modeling techniques, data collection tools, conceptual approaches, bioinformatic methods, genotyping technologies) needed for addressing the objectives of the current nimh strategic plan. nimh encourages but does not limit research training to educational activities that provide trainees with the expertise and tools to:the national institute of dental and craniofacial research (nidcr) is interested in research training programs that develop research capacity to improve dental, oral, and craniofacial health in lmics across the lifespan. nidcr supports basic, translational, and clinical biomedical and behavioral research training in the following areas: dental caries and periodontal diseases; oral infections and host-responses to oral infections; head and neck cancers; dental and craniofacial development; orofacial pain and other oral sensory and motor dysfunctions; salivary glands and disorders, sjögren's syndrome, immune dysfunctions in the oral cavity; population-based, oral health promotion and disease prevention; and restoration and regeneration of dental, oral and craniofacial structures. focus of research training topics in lmics include, but are not limited to: addressing disparities in access to oral health care; prevention, early detection and intervention relating to dental, oral and craniofacial diseases and disorders; development and application of genomics, bioinformatics, and computational biology expertise for basic and translational dental, oral, and craniofacial research; integration of oral health care into care for chronic, non-communicable diseases and disorders, and implementation science. see the following links for areas relevant to the nidcr mission (www.nidcr.nih.gov/about-us/mission) and strategic plan (www.nidcr.nih.gov/about-us/strategic-plan). potential applicants are encouraged to contact the nidcr program officer to discuss the relevance of proposed research training.the national institute on alcohol abuse and alcoholism (niaaa) fosters international collaboration in research and research training that advances the understanding of alcohol misuse and alcohol use disorder (aud). this includes research on prevention of alcohol misuse of alcohol and alcohol use disorder, improving the health and well-being of individuals living with aud and alcohol-associated pathology, such as fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (fasd) and organ damage, and reducing alcohol-related morbidity and mortality. specifically, niaaa supports international research that provides a unique opportunity to generate and disseminate fundamental knowledge on the effects of alcohol misuse on health and applies that knowledge for finding solutions to improve prevention and treatment of alcohol misuse and alcohol use disorder across the lifespan.niaaa encourages research training that capitalizes on emerging research opportunities and provides trainees with knowledge and advanced skills in areas that include, but are not limited to, the following:research shows that diverse teams working together outperform homogenous teams. scientists and trainees from diverse backgrounds and with different life experiences bring different perspectives, creativity, and individual enterprise to address complex scientific problems. diverse teams of scientists will lead the way to develop more innovative inclusive research that will more broadly enhance public health. fostering diversity by addressing underrepresentation in the scientific research workforce is a key component of the nih strategy to identify, develop, support, and maintain the quality of our scientific workforce. niaaa encourages research programs to include a diverse group of scientists, including individuals from underrepresented groups as per not od 20-031 (notice of nih's interest in diversity). niaaa is interested in enhancing representation of individuals from diverse backgrounds, including individuals from racial, ethnic and gender minorities and early-stage investigators.office of disease prevention (odp) is the lead office at the nih responsible for assessing, facilitating, and stimulating research in disease prevention. in partnership with the 27 nih institutes and centers, the odp strives to increase the scope, quality, dissemination, and impact of nih-supported prevention research. the odp is interested in providing co-funding support for research that has strong implications for disease and injury prevention and health equity and that include innovative and appropriate research design, measurement, and analysis methods. furthermore, the odp has a specific interest in projects that develop and/or test preventive interventions. for this nosi, the odp is interested in supporting innovative research training programs that address prevention science across the lifespan. trainees should have a thorough understanding of the principles and practices of rigorous scientific research, as well as disease prevention and health promotion strategies. for additional information about odp’s research priorities and interests, please refer to the odp strategic plan for fiscal years 2019–2023.the odp does not award grants; therefore, applications must be relevant to the objectives of at least one of the participating nih institutes and centers (ic) listed in this announcement. please contact the relevant ic scientific/research contact(s) listed for questions regarding ic research priorities and funding.the office of research on women's health (orwh) mission is to improve the health of women. orwh is part of the office of the director of nih and works in partnership with the 27 nih institutes and ensures that research conducted and supported by the nih addresses issues regarding women's health. orwh works to stimulate and encourage basic and clinical research on the role of sex and gender in health and disease. orwh promotes training and career development of a diverse biomedical research workforce to advance science for the health of women. orwh also develops and supports initiatives to recruit, retain, and advance women in biomedical careers; programs that support both women and men in women’s health and sex differences research careers. orwh is interested in supporting research training in lmics to address women’s cardiovascular diseases with a special interest in cardiovascular diseases of the peripartum period up to one year after delivery. peripartum cardiomyopathy (ppcm) is relatively an uncommon condition in high income countries but its incidence may be rising in lmics. the causes of ppcm are not well understood, but hypotheses including inflammatory processes, genetic predisposition, and stress-mediated antiangiogenic pathway suggest vascular causes triggered around delivery or immediately postpartum. studies have indicated an association with preeclampsia, obesity, multifetal births. because we still do not fully understand the causes of peripartum cardiomyopathy, there is a gap in research and research training to fill. orwh is interested in supporting applications that fulfill goal 1 and goal 4 of the nih strategic plan for women's health and sex differences research, which can be found at: https://orwh.od.nih.gov/sites/orwh/files/docs/orwh_strategic_plan_2019_508c_0.pdspecial notes:this program does not support hiv/aids research training. applicants interested in ncd co-morbidities in the context of hiv research training should apply to the fogarty hiv research training program funding opportunities (see http://www.fic.nih.gov/programs/pages/hiv-aids-research-training.aspx).for cancer-focused d43 program proposals from us institutions, we encourage potential applicants to refer to the national cancer institute (nci) global health research training opportunities: https://www.cancer.gov/about-nci/organization/cgh/research-training-programs/d43-global-research-training.this program will continue to support cancer-related d43 applications directly from lmic institutions (with or without a u.s. partner).this program does not support trauma and injury related research training with the exception of the long-term effects of trauma and injury and related rehabilitation research training, including implementation science across types of trauma and injury. for additional information on the fogarty global trauma and injury research training please visit https://www.fic.nih.gov/programs/pages/trauma-injury.aspx.note: this funding opportunity announcement (foa) allows appointment of trainees (d43) proposing to serve as the lead investigator of an independent clinical trial; or proposing a separate ancillary clinical trial; or proposing to gain research experience in a clinical trial led by another investigator, as part of their research and career development.see section viii. other information for award authorities and regulations.grant: a support mechanism providing money, property, or both to an eligible entity to carry out an approved project or activity.the oer glossary and the sf424 (r&r) application guide provide details on these application types. only those application types listed here are allowed for this foa.optional: accepting applications that either propose or do not propose clinical trial(s).application budgets are limited to $230,000 per year for new awards and $250,000 per year for renewal awards (total direct costs).the maximum project period is up to 5 years.stipends: awards may provide stipends as a subsistence allowance to help defray living expenses during the research training experience. trainees may be paid a stipend comparable to their professional experience.tuition and fees: funds for tuition and academic fees at the u.s. or foreign institution may be requested. however, programs are encouraged to seek cost-sharing arrangements with the grantee institutions to provide reduced tuition for trainees. note that health insurance is not included as part of this

faculty mentors to conduct well justified training activities. support for key personnel, faculty mentors or consultants to attend scientific meetings and conferences is not allowed.these expenses must be justified as specifically required by the proposed program and must not duplicate items generally available at the applicant institution.indirect costs (also known as facilities & administrative [f&a] costs) are reimbursed at 8% of modified total direct costs (exclusive of tuition and fees, consortium costs in excess of $25,000, and expenditures for equipment), rather than on the basis of a negotiated rate agreement.1. eligible applicantshigher education institutionsthe following types of higher education institutions are always encouraged to apply for nih support as public or private institutions of higher education:nonprofits other than institutions of higher educationgovernmentsotherfederal governmentsthe sponsoring institution must assure support for the proposed program. appropriate institutional commitment to the program includes the provision of adequate staff, facilities, and educational resources that can contribute to the planned program.low and middle-income country (lmic) categories are defined by the world bank classification system, according to gross national income (gni) per capita, as "low-income," "lower-middle-income," and "upper-middle-income" (http://data.worldbank.org/about/country-classifications/country-and-lending-groups).applications may be submitted directly by eligible lmic institutions or by eligible domestic (u.s.) institutions that demonstrate collaborations with eligible lmic institution(s) named in their application. foreign applications must come from eligible lmics, not from high income countries (hics). new proposed research training programs are advised to focus on collaboration with a single lmic institution as the major partner. direct applications from lmic institutions are encouraged for both renewals and new submissions. for projects previously led by u.s. institution/pi(s), applicants are encouraged to transfer the leadership to the lmic partner institution or explain why that is not appropriate at this time. already well-established research training programs at the lmic site are encouraged to expand and network with other institutions within the lmic and region.for fic d43 programs, "eligible lmics" do not include g20 countries in the "upper-middle-income country" category (umic/g20) for funding (except for sub-saharan africa). umic/g20 sites may be involved as additional training sites if no faculty or trainees from that umic/g20 institution are supported by the proposed d43. for details, see https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/not-tw-12-011.html "notice of change in country eligibility for fogarty international training grants and country eligibility", and for additional information see: https://www.fic.nih.gov/grants/pages/country-eligibility.aspx.the applicant institution must have one or more strong and high-quality research program(s) in the area(s) proposed under this foa and must have the requisite faculty, staff, potential trainees and facilities on site to conduct the proposed institutional program. in many cases, it is anticipated that the proposed program will complement other ongoing research training programs occurring at the applicant institution and that one of more of the program faculty will have active research projects in which participating trainees may gain relevant experiences consistent with their research interests and goals.non-domestic (non-u.s.) entities (foreign institutions) are eligible to apply.non-domestic (non-u.s.) components of u.s. organizations are eligible to apply.applicant organizationsapplicant organizations must complete and maintain the following registrations as described in the sf 424 (r&r) application guide to be eligible to apply for or receive an award. all registrations must be completed prior to the application being submitted. registration can take 6 weeks or more, so applicants should begin the registration process as soon as possible. the nih policy on late submission of grant applications states that failure to complete registrations in advance of a due date is not a valid reason for a late submission.program directors/principal investigators (pd(s)/pi(s))all pd(s)/pi(s) must have an era commons account. pd(s)/pi(s) should work with their organizational officials to either create a new account or to affiliate their existing account with the applicant organization in era commons. if the pd/pi is also the organizational signing official, they must have two distinct era commons accounts, one for each role. obtaining an era commons account can take up to 2 weeks.any individual(s) with the skills, knowledge, and resources necessary to carry out the proposed research training program as the training program director/principal investigator (training pd/pi) is invited to work with his/her organization to develop an application for support. individuals from underrepresented racial and ethnic groups as well as individuals with disabilities are always encouraged to apply for nih support.for institutions/organizations proposing multiple pds/pis, visit the multiple program director/principal investigator policy and submission details in the senior/key person profile (expanded) component of the sf 424 (r&r) application guide.more than one training pd/pi (multiple pd/pis), may be designated on the application for research training programs that require a team approach and therefore clearly do not fit the single pd/pi model, e.g., interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary training. a single contact pd/pi must be designated for communicating with the nih, although other individuals may contact the nih on behalf of the contact pd/pi when necessary. because training programs are intended to be coherent, a single award will be made. nih will not allocate the budget or training positions between multiple pd/pis. that is the responsibility of the contact pd/pi.the contact pd/pi should be an established investigator in the scientific area in which the application is targeted, must have strong research and research-training program experience and demonstrate administrative and scientific leadership appropriate to the development and implementation of the proposed program. the pd/pi will be responsible for the selection and appointment of trainees to the approved research training program, and for the overall direction, management, administration, and evaluation of the program. the pd/pi will be expected to monitor and assess the program and submit all documents and reports as required. the pd/pi has responsibility for the day-to-day administration of the program and is responsible for appointing members of the advisory committee (when applicable), using their recommendations to determine the appropriate allotment of funds.the applicant institution must name at least one individual at each collaborating institution as the major collaborator for that institution. individuals chosen as major collaborators should be researchers with whom the principal investigator or key personnel named in the application have had prior successful collaborations. these collaborations should be described in the application. the role of the collaborators in setting the research agenda and in conceptualizing and mentoring research projects should be described in the application.all applicants should explain in detail how their relevant research grant support and activities are related to the proposed research training plan.the pd/pi and/or key personnel listed in the application must be designated as the pd of at least one active research award (with at least 18 months of support remaining as of the application due date) that is directly relevant to the research training proposed in the lmic. the research awards may be funded by the nih or by other national or international organizations. the applicants need to document this existing research support in their application. if an award is pending, to use that grant to meet the eligibility requirement, the applicant must provide documentation from the institution issuing the grant that the award is expected, and it will have sufficient remaining resources to continue the research project.lmic pd/pis who are not lmic citizens, must be designated by the eligible lmic as a permanent resident (or equivalent status in the lmic in question, to be verified by the applicant institution).applications for grants with multiple pd/pis require additional information. when considering multiple pd/pis, please be aware that the structure and governance of the pd/pi leadership team as well as the knowledge, skills and experience of the individual pd/pi will be factored into the assessment of the overall scientific merit of the application. multiple pd/pis on a program share the authority and responsibility for leading and directing the research training program, intellectually and logistically. each pd/pi is responsible and accountable to the grantee organization for the proper conduct of the program, including the submission of required reports.applications with multiple training pd/pis must provide a leadership plan that emphasizes how leadership by multiple pd/pis will benefit the research training program and the trainees.additional information on the implementation plans, policies and procedures to formally allow more than one pd/pi is available at https://grants.nih.gov/grants/multi_pi . all pds/pis must be registered in the nih electronic research administration (era) commons prior to the submission of the application (see https://era.nih.gov/register-accounts/understanding-era-commons-accounts.htm for instructions).2. cost sharing3. additional information on eligibilityapplicant organizations may submit more than one application, provided that each application is programmatically distinct.the nih will not accept duplicate or highly overlapping applications under review at the same time, per 2.3.7.4 submission of resubmission application. this means that the nih will not accept:program faculty should have strong records as researchers, including recent publications and successful competition for research support in the area of the proposed research training program. program faculty should also have a record of research training, including successful, former trainees who have established productive careers relevant to the nih mission. researchers from diverse backgrounds, including racial and ethnic minorities, persons with disabilities, and women are encouraged to participate as mentors.traineesthe program is not an individual training fellowship program. potential trainees are appointed by the pd/pi of the award and not by fic/nih.only individuals who are citizens of lmics (defined by the world bank classification system- also refer to not-tw-12-011 "notice of change in country eligibility for fogarty international training grants", for additional information) are eligible for research training support or other training activities (as verified by the pd(s)/pi(s)). individuals who have dual citizenship or permanent residency in the u.s., other high-income countries or umic/g20 ineligible countries described above are not eligible for support.research training may be offered to a wide range of scientists, including field-based and laboratory scientists, social scientists, clinicians and other health professionals in order to fill research capacity gaps at the lmic institution.all long- and medium term (more than one month) trainees are required to pursue their research training full time, normally defined as 40 hours per week, or as specified by the sponsoring institution in accordance with its own policies.research training may be offered at the masters, doctoral, professional degree and postdoctoral levels and for short-term training to a wide range of scientists, including but not limited to laboratory and field scientists, social scientists, clinicians and other health professionals, as well as non-health academics and professionals who with training intend to use their expertise to address gaps in lmic ncd research. training of technical and administrative staff may also be needed to help close research capacity gaps at the lmic institution.attention should be given to recruiting lmic trainees from groups underrepresented in ncd research in the lmic context as potential participants in the program. the ncd-lifespan program strongly encourages pds/pis to include individuals from diverse backgrounds, including women and other individuals from groups underrepresented in biomedical and behavioral research in the country, such as racial, ethnic or socially disadvantaged groups in the country as trainees.1. requesting an application packagethe application forms package specific to this opportunity must be accessed

the particular circumstances of the trainees, the reviewers will evaluate the adequacy of the proposed rcr training in relation to the following five required components: 1) format - does the plan satisfactorily address the format of instruction, e.g., lectures, coursework and/or real-time discussion groups, including face-to-face interaction? (a plan involving only on-line instruction is not acceptable.); 2) subject matter – does the plan include a sufficiently broad selection of subject matter, such as conflict of interest, authorship, data management, human subjects and animal use, laboratory safety, research misconduct, research ethics? 3) faculty participation - does the plan adequately describe how faculty will participate in the instruction? for renewal applications, are all training faculty who served as course directors, speakers, lecturers, and/or discussion leaders during the past project period named in the application? 4) duration of instruction - does the plan meet the minimum requirements for rcr, i.e., at least eight contact hours of instruction? 5) frequency of instruction – does the plan meet the minimum requirements for rcr, i.e., at least once during each career stage (undergraduate, post-baccalaureate, predoctoral, postdoctoral, and faculty levels) and at a frequency of no less than once every four years?for renewal applications, does the progress report document acceptable rcr instruction in the five components described above? does the plan describe how participation in rcr instruction is being monitored? are appropriate changes in the plan for rcr instruction proposed in response to feedback and in response to evolving issues related to responsible conduct of research?plans and past record will be rated as acceptable or unacceptable, and the summary statement will provide the consensus of the review committee.select agent researchreviewers will assess the
