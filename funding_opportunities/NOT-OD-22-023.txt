research (nidcr)national institute on drug abuse (nida)national institute on minority health and health disparities (nimhd)national cancer institute (nci)the office of disease prevention and participating icos are issuing this notice to communicate our interest in research on electronic nicotine delivery systems (ends). research on alternative nicotine and tobacco delivery systems [e.g., heated tobacco products (also called heat-not-burn)] will also be considered. research with a focus on other non-combustible nicotine and tobacco products will be considered on a case-by-case basis. studies should examine population-based, clinical, and applied prevention of disease, including etiology and epidemiology of use, potential risks, benefits and impacts on other tobacco use behavior among different populations. studies exclusively examining smokeless tobacco or combustible tobacco products (e.g., cigarettes, cigars) will be considered non-responsive.background:electronic nicotine delivery systems (ends) are designed to heat a liquid solution, typically containing nicotine, into an aerosol to be inhaled by a user. ends represent a diverse class of products that include e-cigarettes, vapes, vaporizers, vape pens, hookah pens, and pods. in recent years, heated tobacco products, which do not involve combustion and are sometimes called “heat-not-burn", have become available in the united states. for the purposes of this notice, research examining products within the entire class of ends and heated tobacco products is sought. research focused on other emerging non-combustible products will be considered on a case-by-case basis.adult prevalence of ends in 2019 was 4.5%, with young adults having the highest prevalence among all age groups (2020 morbidity and mortality weekly report). current electronic cigarette use among young adults aged 18-24 increased from 7.6% in 2018 to 9.3% in 2019 (2019 morbidity and mortality weekly report). youth ends use is also a significant concern. according to the 2020 national youth tobacco survey, 20% (3 million) of high school students and 4.7% (550,000) of middle school students reported current e-cigarette use.the tobacco product landscape is continuously changing. despite rapidly accumulating research, significant gaps remain in our understanding of the public health effects posed by ends and heated tobacco products. more information is needed to understand the risk profile of the various devices or products and the aerosols they generate. the constantly changing landscape presents additional challenges for understanding how variable patterns of use and exposure to ends aerosol affect biological, physiological, and behavioral health outcomes. research is needed to understand how ends product characteristics, product user characteristics, as well as the communication and policy environment interact to affect ends use patterns (e.g., exclusive use vs. dual use with combustible cigarettes). for example, although many adult smokers report using ends to help them quit smoking or to reduce their cigarette consumption, as noted in the 2020 surgeon general’s report on smoking cessation, there is presently inadequate evidence to conclude that e-cigarettes, in general, increase smoking cessation. these and other research gaps introduce challenges for accurate and meaningful communication about ends and heated tobacco products’ impact on an individual’s health. applied, clinical, and population-based research studies provide a significant opportunity to address many unanswered questions and advance our understanding of their impact on public health.research objectives:this notice encourages studies that seek to address gaps in our understanding related to population-based, clinical, and applied prevention research related to ends and heated tobacco products. the goal of these studies will be to better understand the impact of use of these products on the prevention of disease or the risk of disease (including cancer, dental, oral, and/or craniofacial). increased comprehension about patterns of ends use with other tobacco products and how they affect addiction to nicotine, alcohol, and other drugs is sought, as well as understanding the effects of second- and third-hand exposure to the aerosols.research studies are also needed to assess the short- and long-term health effects of ends products and heated tobacco products across populations of special relevance. research involving special populations such as, but not limited to, those listed below is encouraged:nih-designated populations who experience health disparities in the united states [which include minority or health disparity populations; please refer to https://www.nimhd.nih.gov/about/strategic-plan/nih-strategic-plan-definitions-and-parameters.html and https://dpcpsi.nih.gov/sites/default/files/sgmstrategicplan_2021_2025.pdf for definitions and additional information.this nosi encourages feasibility and pilot research, as well as efficacy and effectiveness research on new or adapted interventions. observational, clinical and intervention human studies are appropriate. research projects may also test new or adapted interventions, evaluate existing or ongoing community-based interventional programs or policies to generate significantly novel insights, or conduct dissemination and implementation research. investigators must carefully review the specific priority areas of research for the nih icos that are participating in this nosi. although areas of overlap among the icos exist, the specific research areas of interest for each participating nih ico are listed below.where appropriate, the standardized research e-cigarette (https://www.drugabuse.gov/funding/supplemental-information-nida-e-cig) should be considered for use in addressing specific research questions, or as a comparator for commercially available ends.study designdesign, analysis, and sample size considerations for studies to evaluate interventions:investigators seeking to evaluate the effect of an intervention on a health-related biomedical or behavioral outcome may propose a study design in which groups subjected to the intervention are compared to groups that are exposed to an appropriate comparison condition. the comparison condition should be justified based on the state-of-the-science for the intervention and the nature of the research question. designs that might be proposed for studies that randomize groups or deliver interventions to groups include parallel group- or cluster-randomized trials, stepped-wedge group- or cluster- randomized trials, multiple baseline designs, and other quasi-experimental designs. whenever participants are assigned in groups or clusters (e.g., families, clinics, schools, worksites, communities, counties, states), or participants receive some part of their intervention in a group or cluster, and observations on individual participants are analyzed for between-group effects, special methods are required for analysis and sample size. applicants will need to show that their methods are appropriate given their plans for assignment of participants and delivery of interventions. additional information is available at https://researchmethodsresources.nih.gov/.other potential study designs: randomized controlled trials may not be possible in all innovative research designs, e.g., where it is not possible to assign participants to high versus low discrimination condition or in small sample size communities where cross intervention contamination is likely to occur or be a problem. alternative rigorous research designs that provide robust evidence of intervention effectiveness include quasi-experimental designs, such as multiple baseline or repeated measures design, interrupted time series design, or stepped-wedge cluster randomized designs in which all subjects receive the intervention. further, hybrid effectiveness-implementation designs allow early observational investigation of implementation processes while also testing intervention effectiveness. investigators should justify their research and analytic design selection and provide adequate evidence of their ability to execute a rigorous and appropriate analysis of randomized or non-randomized study data.ic specific application and submission information:applicants must select the ic and associated foa to use for submission of an application in response to this nosi. the selection must align with the ic requirements listed in order to be considered responsive to that foa. non-responsive applications will be withdrawn from consideration for this initiative. in addition, applicants will be assigned to those ics on this nosi that have indicated those foas are acceptable and based on usual application-ic assignment practices.national cancer institute (nci)the national cancer institute encourages the submission of applications to fill gaps in the science regarding population, clinical and applied research on ends. research on other emerging or novel nicotine and tobacco delivery systems, such as heated tobacco products (also called heat-not-burn) will also be considered. the nci is interested in studies that investigate potential contributions to cancer risk from ends use alone or in combination with other tobacco products (dual/poly tobacco use). of particular interest is research that seeks to better understand and prevent youth and young adult ends and heated tobacco product use, including initiation, escalation to regular use, dependence and studies that address ends cessation. this includes studies to identify the risk and protective factors that influence use patterns, and studies to understand trajectories of use, including intersection with other tobacco product use (e.g., cigarettes, cigars). moreover, nci encourages studies to understand the impact of communication and policy approaches (especially state and local policies) to address ends use, particularly among adolescents, young adults, and other populations that experience greater tobacco-related health disparities.specific topics of interest include but are not limited to:nci’s foas for this nosi include the following or their subsequent
