august 23, 2021pa-20-185 - nih research project grant (parent r01 clinical trial not allowed)pa-20-195 - nih exploratory/developmental research grant program (parent r21 clinical trial not allowed)national institute on aging (nia)the goal of this notice of special interest (nosi) is to encourage the use of existing cohorts and datasets for well-focused secondary analyses to investigate novel scientific ideas and/or address clinically related issues on: (1) aging changes influencing health across the lifespan (e.g., alzheimerâ€™s disease and alzheimer's disease-related dementias (ad/adrd)), (2) diseases and disabilities in older persons, and/or (3) the changes in basic biology of aging that underlie these impacts on health (the hallmarks of aging). activities of high priority include those addressing specific hypotheses in basic biological research, clinical aging research, behavioral or social research, and/or translational geroscience to inform: the design and implementation of future epidemiologic or human intervention studies; interventions in animal models of aging; research on behavioral and social factors over the life course that influence health (e.g., early life adversity); current geriatric practice in maintenance of health, disease management, and prevention of disability; or research testing of possible causal relationships between rates of aging and findings extracted by secondary analysis of the existing data. existing datasets may also be used to develop and test new mathematical modeling and statistical analytical approaches. analyses of sex and/or gender differences across health disparity groups (e.g., racial and ethnic groups, socioeconomic status, and sexual and gender minorities) are of high relevance. use of cohorts that are linked to electronic health record systems and/or centers for medicare and medicaid services (cms) administrative data are especially welcome.applicants responding to this nosi are strongly encouraged to describe plans for rapid sharing of data and results as well as innovative data analytics approaches (see goal 3, nih strategic plan for data science).please note that applications proposing exploratory or developmental projects should consider using pa-20-195, whereas projects that already have sufficient preliminary data or a very strong and well-developed scientific premise should use pa-20-185.backgroundclinical trials and epidemiologic research projects (case-control or cohort studies) typically generate data with potential utility beyond the specific hypotheses and questions for which they were originally designed. considerable potential exists in using secondary analyses of available clinical datasets and collections of biospecimens and related study data to explore and test hypotheses about how biological changes affect health across the life span, including disease and disability in old age. these types of analyses are also a cost-effective means to inform the design of future studies in clinical aging research.information collected through health administration activities (e.g., electronic health records, health insurance claims data, etc.) may also provide a rich source of data relating to health maintenance and disease prevention practices; the incidence and prevalence of chronic conditions and diseases (including multiple morbidities); patterns of geriatric care and medication use; health outcomes (including disabilities); resource utilization (including comparative effectiveness research); and economic impact. administrative datasets have potential advantages in terms of availability; large size and representativeness; breadth of medical and demographic information; localization of care (e.g., community, hospital, and long-term facilities); and suitability for linkage with other datasets. in some settings, such as disease prevention or screening programs, results of clinical studies may also be available.this nosi will support secondary analyses focused on the following:this nosi encourages applicants to use datasets as well as biospecimens and related data from a variety of sources, including:investigators are also encouraged to augment existing datasets as appropriate and feasible to address their study hypotheses. for example, new analyses performed on existing electronic linkage with or among administrative databases could increase the utility of the data for answering relevant clinical questions. comparison between existing databases or within merged datasets (e.g., young adults with mid-life, mid-life with older adults, etc.) is also encouraged as appropriate to address the study question, especially to address specific research hypotheses related to aging changes across the lifespan.costs for archiving of data to be made publicly available may be included in the budget as long as the archival activities are related to the proposed secondary analyses. plans for creation of a publicly archived database must include adequate dataset documentation and instructions for use by investigators not affiliated with the original study. provision for easy accessibility of archived datasets is required. applications requesting inclusion/archiving of datasets in the agingresearchbiobank are welcome and should follow the process outlined at https://agingresearchbiobank.nia.nih.gov/.potential applicants may also wish to review the following links to identify observational cohorts or clinical trials from which valuable data and/or biospecimens may be analyzed to address clinical aging research questions:applicants are responsible for adhering to the individual study policies governing ancillary projects and access to clinical trials data and/or biorepository samples. the application must include a letter of support from the relevant study committee granting access to the datasets and/or repository (if the application involves analysis of stored samples) and approval of the proposed secondary analysis study.research objectives:secondary analyses of existing cohorts, datasets, or collections of biospecimens and related study data may include, but are not limited to, the following:methodology development. single or multiple data sets may be used to develop and test new analytic approaches for any of the above topics. additionally, methodological studies may also address inferential issues in observational data on treatment effects, such as confounding by indication, including the following:application and
