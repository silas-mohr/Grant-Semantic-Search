health and human services partners. you must use one of these submission options to access the application forms for this opportunity.we encourage inquiries concerning this funding opportunity and welcome the opportunity to answer questions from potential applicants.the overall goal of the nih research career development program is to help ensure that a diverse pool of highly trained scientists is available in appropriate scientific disciplines to address the nation's biomedical, behavioral, and clinical research needs. nih institutes and centers (ics) support a variety of mentored and non-mentored career development award programs designed to foster the transition of new investigators to research independence and to support established investigators in achieving specific objectives. candidates should review the different career development (k) award programs to determine the best program to support their goals. more information about career programs may be found at the nih extramural training mechanisms website.the objective of the career transition award (k22) is to provide support to outstanding, newly trained basic or clinical investigators to develop their research skills through a two phase program: an initial period involving an intramural position at the nih and a subsequent period of support at an extramural institution. the award is intended to facilitate the establishment of a record of independent research by the candidate in order to sustain or promote a successful, independent research career.the specific goals of this nimh k22 program are to: 1) support the career development of postdoctoral fellows conducting research in the nimh division of intramural programs (dirp); and 2) foster their career advancement to independent, academic faculty positions in the extramural community where they will develop their independent research programs. this k22 program offers nimh intramural fellows a funding opportunity comparable to those available to their extramural counterparts (see https://www.nimh.nih.gov/funding/training/funding-opportunities-for-early-career-investigators.shtml).this nimh mentored career transition award for nimh intramural fellows will support two phases of mentored research career development: a mentored intramural phase no less than one year, and up to two years, in duration, and a mentored extramural phase up to three years in duration, for a total maximum of five years of support. transition from the intramural to the extramural phase is not automatic. in order to transition to the extramural phase, awardees must obtain a tenure-track or equivalent faculty position at an academic institution, with strong institutional commitment to their development as independent investigators and with appropriate faculty to serve as the extramural mentor.this foa is intended to facilitate the transition of nimh intramural fellows to independent, extramural faculty positions. applicants should propose a well-conceived research plan that investigates a significant scientific problem within the nimh mission. the research plan must span both phases of the award. regardless of the research question or approach, applicants should obtain a fundamental understanding of the requirements for experimental rigor and build such processes into their research project. in addition to the specific research plan, applicants should develop, with their intramural phase mentors, a comprehensive, individualized career development plan to obtain the skills and experiences that will facilitate a successful, independent research career. skills should include grant-writing and oral presentation skills, specialized coursework if needed, and expertise in experimental design and statistics. the career development plan should also include activities such as networking with key researchers in their field, both nationally and internationally, attendance at workshops designed to enhance specialized knowledge and skills, and presentations at national and international meetings. applicants should also receive guidance on administrative skills associated with an independent research career, such as laboratory management.note: this funding opportunity announcement (foa) is designed specifically for applicants proposing research that does not involve leading an independent clinical trial, a clinical trial feasibility study, or an ancillary clinical trial. applicants to this foa are permitted to propose research experience in a clinical trial led by a mentor or co-mentor. applicants proposing a clinical trial or an ancillary clinical trial as lead investigator, should apply to the companion foa (pa-21-195). applicants to this foa are permitted to propose research experience in a clinical trial led by a mentor or co-mentor.candidates are encouraged to consult with the appropriate staff person in section vii - agency contacts, prior to submitting an application, to discuss eligibility and program requirements.see section viii. other information for award authorities and regulations.grant: a support mechanism providing money, property, or both to an eligible entity to carry out an approved project or activity.the oer glossary and the sf424 (r&r) application guide provide details on these application types.note: applicants may propose to gain experience in a clinical trial led by a mentor/co-mentor as part of their research career development.need help determining whether you are doing a clinical trial?the number of awards is contingent upon nih appropriations and the submission of a sufficient number of meritorious applicationsduring the extramural phase of the award, nimh will contribute up to $90,000 for phds or $100,000 for mds per year toward the salary of the career award recipient. further guidance on budgeting for career development salaries is provided in the sf424 (r&r) application guide.the total salary requested in the extramural phase must be based on a full-time appointment. the salary must be consistent both with the established salary structure at the institution and with salaries actually provided by the institution from its own funds to other staff members of equivalent qualifications, rank, and responsibilities in the department concerned. if full-time, 12-month salaries are not currently paid to comparable staff members, the salary proposed must be appropriately related to the existing salary structure. confirmation of salary may be required prior to the issuance of an award. fringe benefits, based on the sponsoring institution’s rate and the percent of effort, are provided in addition to salary.the total salary, however, may not exceed the legislatively mandated salary cap. see: http://grants.nih.gov/grants/policy/salcap_summary.htm.in the extramural phase, nimh will contribute up to $50,000 per year toward the research development costs of the award recipient, which must be justified and consistent with the stage of development of the candidate and the proportion of time to be spent in research or career development activities.salary for mentors, secretarial and administrative assistants, etc. is not allowed.for the extramural phase award, indirect costs (also known as facilities & administrative [f&a] costs) are reimbursed at 8% of modified total direct costs.higher education institutionsthe following types of higher education institutions are always encouraged to apply for nih support as public or private institutions of higher education:nonprofits other than institutions of higher educationfor-profit organizationsonly nimh intramural laboratories are eligible to apply for the intramural phase of the k22 mechanism on behalf of intramural candidates. transition to the extramural phase requires an extramural appointment.applicant organizationsapplicant organizations must complete and maintain the following registrations as described in the sf 424 (r&r) application guide to be eligible to apply for or receive an award. all registrations must be completed prior to the application being submitted. registration can take 6 weeks or more, so applicants should begin the registration process as soon as possible. the nih policy on late submission of grant applications states that failure to complete registrations in advance of a due date is not a valid reason for a late submission.program directors/principal investigators (pd(s)/pi(s))all pd(s)/pi(s) must have an era commons account. pd(s)/pi(s) should work with their organizational officials to either create a new account or to affiliate their existing account with the applicant organization in era commons. if the pd/pi is also the organizational signing official, they must have two distinct era commons accounts, one for each role. obtaining an era commons account can take up to 2 weeks.any nimh dirp postdoctoral fellow with the skills, knowledge, and resources necessary to carry out the proposed research as the program director/principal investigator (pd/pi) is invited to work with his/her mentor and organization to develop an application for support. individuals from underrepresented racial and ethnic groups as well as individuals with disabilities are always encouraged to apply for nih support. multiple pds/pis are not allowed.by the time of award, the individual must be a citizen or a non-citizen national of the united states or have been lawfully admitted for permanent residence (i.e., possess a currently valid permanent resident card uscis form i-551, or other legal verification of such status).k22 applicants must have no more than 6 years of postdoctoral experience at the time of the initial or the subsequent resubmission application, and must currently be conducting research as a postdoctoral fellow (i.e., clinical fellow, research fellow, irta postdoctoral fellow) in the nimh dirp (see https://oir.nih.gov/sourcebook/personnel/ipds-appointment-mechanisms). time spent in clinical training during residency or clinical specialty is not counted towards k22 eligibility. time spent in research training during these periods is counted toward k22 eligibility. parental leave or other well-justified leave for personal or family situations of generally less than 12-months duration (e.g., family care responsibilities, disability or illness, active military duty) is not included in the 6-year eligibility limit. part-time postdoctoral research, related to personal or family situations or occurring during a research residency or fellowship, will be pro-rated accordingly. in addition, time spent conducting required postgraduate clinical activities that do not involve research is not considered part of the 6-year eligibility limit.the k22 award is intended for individuals with career-stage appropriate research experience, and who require up to an additional five years of mentored research and career development. consequently, the strongest applicants will require, and will propose, a well-conceived plan for substantive mentored research and career development that will help them become competitive candidates for tenure-track or equivalent faculty positions and to launch robust, independent research programs. if an applicant achieves research independence (any faculty or equivalent independent research position) before the intramural phase k22 award is made, neither phase of the k22 award will be made.candidates for the k22 award must have a clinical or research doctorate (including phd, md, do, dc, nd, dds, dvm, scd, dns, pharmd, or equivalent doctoral degree), or a combined clinical and research doctoral degree.applicant organizations may submit more than one application, provided that each application is scientifically distinct, and each is from a different candidate.the nih will not accept duplicate or highly overlapping applications under review at the same time. an individual may not have two or more competing nih career development applications pending review concurrently. in addition, nih will not accept:candidates may submit research project grant (rpg) applications concurrently with the k application. however, any concurrent rpg application may not have substantial scientific and/or budgetary overlap with the career award application. k award recipients are encouraged to obtain funding from nih or other federal sources either as a pd/pi on a competing research grant award or cooperative agreement, or as project leader on a competing multi-project award as described in not-od-08-065.individuals are eligible for a k22 award if they have been, or currently are, the pd/pi of an nih r03 or r21 grant or a phs or non-federal award that duplicates the specific aims or research goals of an r03 or r21 grant. individuals are not eligible to apply if they have pending an application for any other phs career development award, an nih institute-specific k22, or a pathway to independence award (k99/r00). individuals are not eligible to apply if they have been or are currently a pd/pi on an nih research grant (such as r01, r29, p01) or a subproject leader on a program project (p01) or center grant (p50), or a non-nih equivalent to these grants/awards.at the time of award, the candidate must have a "full-time" appointment at the applicant's institution. . candidates are required to commit a minimum of 75% of full-time professional effort (i.e., a minimum of 9 person-months) to their program of career development. candidates may engage in other duties as part of the remaining 25% of their full-time professional effort not covered by this award, as long as such duties do not interfere with or detract from the proposed career development program.candidates who have va appointments may not consider part of the va effort toward satisfying the full time requirement at the applicant institution. candidates with va appointments should contact the staff person in the relevant institute or center prior to preparing an application to discuss their eligibility.after the receipt of the award, adjustments to the required level of effort may be made in certain circumstances. see not-od-09-036 for more details.mentor(s)before submitting the application, the candidate must identify a mentor who will supervise the proposed career development and research experience. the mentor should be an active investigator in the area of the proposed research and be committed both to the career development of the candidate and to the direct supervision of the candidate’s research. the mentor must document the availability of sufficient research support and facilities for high-quality research. candidates are encouraged to identify more than one mentor, i.e., a mentoring team, if this is deemed advantageous for providing expert advice in all aspects of the research career development program. in such cases, one individual must be identified as the primary mentor who will coordinate the candidate’s research. the candidate must work with the mentor(s) in preparing the application. the mentor, or a member of the mentoring team, should have a successful track record of mentoring individuals at the candidate’s career stage. where feasible, women, individuals from diverse racial and ethnic groups, and individuals with disabilities should be involved as mentors to serve as role models.the mentor(s) or mentoring team must demonstrate appropriate expertise, experience, and ability to guide the applicant in the organization, management and implementation of the proposed research. mentors are expected to contribute to the successful completion of all career development components, as well as provide guidance on choosing and negotiating an appropriate extramural position.during the transition to the extramural phase, the candidate must identify an extramural mentor who is qualified to oversee the candidate's research activities and promote their career development.the intramural phase applicant institution must be the nimh dirp. both the intramural phase and extramural phase applicant institutions must have strong, well-established records of research and career development activities and faculty qualified to serve as mentors in biomedical, behavioral, or clinical research.buttons to access the online assist system or to download application forms are available in part 1 of this foa. see your administrative office for
