niaidâ€™s interest in the development and optimization of next generation methodologies for hiv-1 drug resistance (dr) mutation detection and reporting. this is needed to improve the guidance available to treatment and prevention programs for both individuals and populations. research responsive to this nosi could include the development of: (i) highly sensitive mutation detection technologies that can be integrated into multiplex assay systems capable of simultaneous assessment of large numbers of potential mutations (ii) point of care (poc) dr assays, or (iii) strategies for rapid acquisition, curation and analysis of these hiv dr data and timely dissemination to healthcare providers and public health decision makers. strategies applicable to low and middle income countries as defined by the world bank are especially encouraged.hiv dr has been identified as an increasing barrier to effective antiretroviral therapy (art) and is expected to have a growing impact on pre-exposure prophylaxis (prep). this is critical, given that art and prep are core components of the hiv response. users and providers need to know as early as possible when dr emerges, and public health authorities need clade, region, and population-specific dr information to evaluate the effectiveness of current art and prep practices and policies. similar data regarding mutations conferring resistance to broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnabs) used for hiv treatment and prevention may be considered for inclusion in future hiv multiplex assays.recent technological advances offer new options for generating, analyzing, and reporting these much-needed data. for example, diagnostic platforms that use crispr-based technology and microfluidic chips make it possible to perform a large number of hiv dr mutation tests simultaneously. despite the challenges, it appears that these new platforms can also be developed for poc use.there is also a need to develop tools to capture, analyze, and report the large datasets these platforms produce. these tools must be rapid and the reports generated easily interpretable by local providers, and national and regional authorities. examples might include real-time hiv dr dashboards, algorithms to predict emerging hot spots, and similar tools.nida statement of interestthe development of technology and strategies to promote use of art and prep and to determine hiv dr as soon as possible is critical among people who use and/or inject drugs and are likely to experience hiv dr, and/or gaps in hiv testing and care. this will likely require adaptations in technology, testing, and dissemination of results to engage this population and non-health care settings including homeless shelters, justice settings, substance abuse treatment and behavioral health facilities, and syringe service programs.nida is interested in the following areas:application and submission informationapplicants must select the ic and associated foa to use for
