notice of change to niehs target foas for not-hl-20-788national heart, lung, and blood institute (nhlbi) national institute of environmental health sciences (niehs)national institute of environmental health sciences (niehs)purposethe purpose of this trans-nih notice of special interest (nosi) is to inform potential applicants that the national heart, lung, and blood institute (nhlbi) and the national institute of environmental health sciences (niehs) have special interest in applications aiming to investigate the impact of personal interventions to reduce exposure to particulate matter (pm) in air pollution on cardiovascular and pulmonary (cardiopulmonary) outcomes. this notice specifically encourages intervention studies or clinical trials that examine the efficacy of personal air pollution interventions to reduce the adverse cardiopulmonary effects of particulate matter (pm) <2.5 μm in diameter (pm2.5) in high risk or vulnerable participants.backgroundsubstantial evidence supports pm2.5 as the fifth leading risk factor for global mortality, accounting for roughly 8.9 million deaths per year - 213,000 in north america alone. short-term pm2.5 exposure increases the risk for acute myocardial infarction, stroke, heart failure, arrhythmias (af and ventricular ectopy), and/or sudden death. chronic pm2.5 exposure increases these risks to an even greater degree (roughly 10% per 10 μg/m3) and effects may be even more pronounced in susceptible sub-populations such as older adults, lower socioeconomic status, and individuals with pre-existing conditions (e.g., diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease, heart failure, asthma and copd). with the rates of wildfires increasing, there is also growing concern of wildfire smoke exposure in the u.s. adversely impacting air quality and contributing to respiratory and cardiovascular disorders.to assess the current state of the science on the potential benefits of reducing the impact of air pollution in high risk or susceptible populations, a trans-agency workshop was organized (https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/events/2019/reducing-cardiopulmonary-impact-particulate-matter-air-pollution-high-risk-populations). experts from academia, federal agencies in the areas of air pollution exposure assessment, epidemiology, cardiovascular, pulmonary medicine, clinical trials, building engineering and healthcare disparities who attended this two-day workshop recognized the need to support a focused research effort on preventing and reducing exposures among at-risk individuals at the personal level.personal level interventions are defined as approaches used to reduce an individual's pm2.5 exposure (from indoor and outdoor sources) and commonly include indoor portable air cleaners (pacs) and facemasks (e.g., n95 respirators). a growing body of evidence suggests that personal interventions can reduce exposure to pm2.5 and improve surrogate markers of cardiometabolic risk. however, while several strategies exist, the most relevant interventions feasibly implemented in large populations are understudied.research objectivesthis trans-nih partnership seeks to foster clinical trial/intervention research examining the efficacy of personal interventions to reduce pm2.5 exposures and the associated benefits in cardiopulmonary outcomes. this nosi specifically encourages studies focusing on mechanistic, subclinical outcomes, and if feasible, clinical outcomes, particularly in high risk populations.specific topics of research interest include, but are not limited to the following:nhlbiniehsin addition to the research topics listed above, possible interests of the niehs include but are not limited to the following:application and submission informationthis notice applies to due dates on or after october 5, 2020 and subsequent receipt dates through september 7, 2025. submit applications for this initiative using the following funding opportunity announcements (foas) or any reissues of these announcements through the expiration date of this notice.nhlbi foas for this nosifoa numberfoa titlefirst available due datepa-20-183research project grant (parent r01 clinical trial required)october 5, 2020pa-20-185research project grant (parent r01 clinical trial not allowed)october 5, 2020niehs foas for this nosifoa numberfoa titlefirst available due datepa-20-183research project grant (parent r01 clinical trial required)october 5, 2020pa-20-184nih research project grant (parent r01 basic experimental studies with humans required)october 5, 2020pa-20-185research project grant (parent r01 clinical trial not allowed)october 5, 2020all instructions in the sf424 (r&r) application guide and the funding opportunity announcement used for submission must be followed, with the following additions:investigators planning to submit an application in response to this nosi are strongly encouraged to contact and discuss their proposed research/aims with a program officer listed on this nosi well in advance of the grant receipt date.please direct all inquiries to the contacts in section vii of the listed funding opportunity announcements with the following additions/substitutionsscientific/research contact(s)lawrence j. fine, md, drph national heart, lung, and blood institute (nhlbi) telephone: 301-435-0305 email: lawrence.fine@nih.govbonnie joubert, mph, phd national institute of environmental health sciences (niehs) telephone: 984-287-3276 email: bonnie.joubert@nih.govsrikanth nadadur, phd national institute of environmental health sciences (niehs) telephone: 984-287-3296 email: nadadurs@niehs.nih.govfinancial/grants management contact(s)tammi simpson national heart, lung, and blood institute (nhlbi) telephone: 301-435-0166 email: simpsontl@mail.nih.govweekly toc for this announcement nih funding opportunities and noticesnote: for help accessing pdf, rtf, ms word, excel, powerpoint, audio or video files, see help downloading files.
