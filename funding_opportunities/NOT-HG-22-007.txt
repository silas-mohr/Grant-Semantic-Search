many new ideas in this field will be best developed through investigator-initiated work such as called for in this nosi.as highlighted in the nhgri strategic vision (https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2817-4)“determining the connection of specific variants to phenotypes remains challenging. systematic approaches, including tactics that connect high-throughput molecular readouts of functional genomic assays to organismal phenotypes, are required to establish the phenotypic consequences of all genomic variants—individually and in combination—in a cell-type context across the life span.”“new methods to analyse data that account for human diversity, coupled with a growing clarity about genotype–phenotype relationships, must be developed to deduce associations and interactions among genomic variants and environmental factors, improve estimates of penetrance and expressivity, and enhance the clinical utility of genomic information for predicting risk, prognosis, treatment response, and, ultimately, clinical outcomes.”scopenhgri seeks applications that will develop methods to provide a better understanding of how genetic variation relates to function, phenotype, and disease risk or traits. for this nosi, the term “disease risk or traits” is used broadly, to encompass diseases, risk of diseases, protective effects against diseases, molecular phenotypes, organismal phenotypes, clinical phenotypes or outcomes, traits, responses to therapeutic drugs or vaccines, and other outcomes relevant to human health and disease.the focus should be on developing approaches that can be applied generally to many or all genes, variants, diseases, or phenotypes. approaches may be developed and tested using specific genomic elements, variants, cell types, diseases, traits, regulatory interactions, or networks; however, the generalizability of the approach must be explained well. approaches that are comprehensive across the genome and assay many or all variants at once are encouraged. this nosi is not intended for approaches that are only applicable to or focus on specific diseases, genes, or variants. this nosi aims to support the development of novel approaches, so applications whose major aim is the production of data sets using existing approaches are also not appropriate for this nosi.use of model organisms or model systems is encouraged, particularly when approaches are especially suited for these systems. however, information from these models should be relevant to humans, such as through understanding of general principles or methodological advances.the proposed work may occur in several areas; in all cases these methods will need to be at the genomic scale and generalizable across diseases, in keeping with the nhgri mission:the methods and data should be released broadly, to allow others to evaluate the methods and compare them with other methods. nhgri encourages investigators who plan to collect phenotype or environmental exposure data to use the standard protocols in the phenx toolkit (www.phenxtoolkit.org).please see: nhgri’s expectation for sharing quality metadata and phenotypic data (https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/not-hg-21-022.html).genomic studies have generally lacked inclusion of substantial numbers of non-european-ancestry participants, so the production or analysis of data from individuals of diverse ethnicities and ancestries is encouraged.to enable the widest use of any functional data, any human subjects consents should allow broad, general research use of the data, with no restrictions on the types of researchers who may use the data. where possible, use of samples consented for submission of data into unrestricted databases is strongly encouraged. please see: nhgri implementation of the nih genomic data sharing policy https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/not-hg-20-011.htmlapplication and submission informationapplication and submission informationthis notice applies to receipt dates on february 5, 2022, and subsequent ones through october 5, 2024, for new applications, and november 5, 2024, for renewal and resubmission applications.since this nosi aims to support methods development that is general across diseases or traits, the aims should focus on the development of methods rather than on specific biomedical results or hypotheses. the introduction should explain the general problem that the methods to be developed aim to address. applicants should be clear how studies of specific diseases or phenotypes will contribute to the development of the methods that apply broadly to many diseases and phenotypes; i.e., the application should be about methods development, not about a specific disease.applications for this initiative should be submitted using any of these funding opportunity announcements (foas) or any reissues of these announcements, through the expiration date of this notice:pa-20-185- nih research project grant (parent r01 clinical trial not allowed)pa-20-195- nih exploratory/developmental research grant program (parent r21 clinical trial not allowed)pa-21-259 - phs 2021-2 omnibus solicitation of the nih, cdc and fda for small business innovation research grant applications (parent sbir [r43/r44] clinical trial not allowedpa-21-262 - phs 2021-2 omnibus solicitation of the nih for small business technology transfer grant applications (parent sttr [r41/r42] clinical trial not allowed)applicants are encouraged to contact nhgri staff early in the application process, and also to review the nhgri guidance to potential applicants for nhgri support:https://www.genome.gov/research-funding/funding-opportunities/guidance.all instructions in thesf424 (r&r) application guideand the funding opportunity announcement used for submission must be followed, with the following addition:research with a focus on technology development, such as the development of assays of the effects of genetic variation on functional data types, genome editing, functional interactions between variants and regulatory elements, dna or rna sequencing, or recorders of genomic activity or lineages, should be submitted to not-hg-21-018.research with a focus on diversity as related to polygenic risk scores or polygenic prediction of health should be submitted to not-hg-20-010applications nonresponsive to terms of this nosi will not be considered for the nosi initiative.scientific/research contactsstatistical genetics and general questions:lisa d. brooks, ph.d. national human genome research institute (nhgri) telephone: 301-547-1387 email: lisa.brooks@nih.govstatistical genetics and clinical interpretation:rongling li, m.d., ph.d., m.p.h. national human genome research institute (nhgri) telephone: 301-480-2487 email: lir2@mail.nih.govfunctional genomics and causality:stephanie a. morris, ph.d. national human genome research institute (nhgri) telephone: 301-435-5738 email: morriss2@mail.nih.govcomparative genomics:jennifer troyer, ph.d. national human genome research institute (nhgri) telephone: 301-312-3276 email: troyerj@mail.nih.govpeer review contactsexamine your era commons account for review assignment and contact information (information appears two weeks after the submission due date).financial/grants management contactdeanna ingersoll national human genome research institute (nhgri) telephone: 301-435-7858 email: deanna.ingersoll@nih.govweekly toc for this announcement nih funding opportunities and noticesnote: for help accessing pdf, rtf, ms word, excel, powerpoint, audio or video files, see help downloading files.
