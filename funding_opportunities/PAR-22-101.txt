that is, diseases affecting fewer than 200,000 individuals in the united states (per the rare diseases act of 2002). collectively, there are an estimated 7,000 rare diseases, which affect approximately 25-30 million people in the united states. most are serious or life-threatening, leading to significant morbidity and mortality, and most affect children. despite advances in our understanding of the causes and mechanisms of many rare diseases, effective treatments are available for fewer than 5%.to address this significant public health concern, the nih investment into discovery research has contributed to unprecedented opportunities to translate scientific advances into better treatments. gene therapy and related approaches are an example of opportunities that have resulted from technological advances. however, to evaluate such potentially transformative treatments, researchers, biopharmaceutical companies, and regulators need high quality, natural history data, as well as biological and clinical outcome measures fit for the intended purpose. the absence of such information often represents a bottleneck in therapy development for many rare diseases.this initiative aims to support studies that address these gaps in understanding of disease natural history and appropriate outcome measures. given the large number of rare diseases and the limited funding available, this initiative will focus on studies for which it can be demonstrated that there are clinical development candidates for the indication, and for which there are unmet medical needs. the initiative will promote partnerships among academic investigators, industry, and patient groups, and will encourage interactions with the food and drug administration (fda). use of existing data standards, tools, information technology platforms, and candidate clinical outcomes measures and biomarkers will also be encouraged, rather than the discovery or de novo development of such tools and resources.definitionsthis foa describes a specialized type of clinical research that is intended to provide data necessary for the design of future clinical trials.clinical trial readiness is the state of having validated clinical research tools and knowledge of disease natural history necessary for the design of efficient clinical trials. validated clinical research tools can include biomarkers or clinical outcome assessment measures that are fit-for-purpose within a defined context of use relevant to the clinical trials. knowledge of disease natural history necessary for clinical trial design can include characteristics for stratification or determining inclusion and exclusion criteria; the stage of disease progression that may be responsive to treatment; and data needed for determining sample size through power calculations.this foa uses terminology defined in the best (biomarkers, endpoints, and other tools) resource, which was developed by the fda-nih biomarker working group. investigators are encouraged to use the terms below, where appropriate in their applications. guidance to reviewers will include these definitions as a way to promote consistent evaluation of the applications. (see https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/nbk338448 for reference to the best resource's glossary for the following definitions.)biomarker – a defined characteristic that is measured as an indicator of normal biological processes, pathogenic processes, or responses to an exposure or intervention, including therapeutic interventions. molecular, histologic, radiographic, or physiologic characteristics are types of biomarkers. categories of biomarkers include: susceptibility/risk, diagnostic, monitoring, prognostic, predictive, pharmacodynamic/response, safety.clinical outcome assessment (coa) – an assessment of an outcome that reflects how an individual feels, functions or survives. the four types of coas are clinician-reported, observer-reported, patient-reported, and performance outcomes.context of use (cou) – a statement that fully and clearly describes the way the medical product development tool is to be used and the medical product development-related purpose of the use.concept – in a regulatory context, the concept is the aspect of an individual’s clinical, biological, physical, or functional state, or experience that the assessment is intended to capture (or reflect).validation – a process to establish that the performance of a test, tool, or instrument is acceptable for its intended purpose. for this foa, the intended purpose should be the collection of data in a clinical trial that will be used to determine whether to move forward with the intervention being tested to a later stage trial or for regulatory approval.scopeto optimize clinical trial readiness, there needs to be sufficient understanding of the rare disease to permit design, conduct, and interpretation of rigorous clinical trials. fda published draft guidance on common issues in drug development for rare diseases. this foa is intended to support studies that address some of the issues presented in this guidance document, including the need for adequate understanding of the course of the disease and the need for sensitive and reliable biomarkers and outcome measures to be used during a clinical trial.the proposed studies should have a research question able to be addressed within the defined timeline. the projects should not include clinical trials. if considering clinical trials, then please reference the ncats website for other open opportunities.applicants are expected to have clinical expertise for the rare disease under study, including the capability for measuring coas and analyzing appropriate biomarkers where applicable. applicants should also have sufficient numbers of rare disease patients for inclusion in the study or have access to additional patients through collaboration.projects appropriate for this initiative need not be high risk/high reward studies; however, they should advance the field by facilitating clinical trial readiness through the development of missing components that are essential for rigorous clinical trials. projects should be distinct from those supported through the traditional r01 mechanism and should have a broader scope than those suited for an r03.projects that are appropriate for this foa should focus on diseases that lack critical components of trial readiness and should have candidate therapeutics that will be ready for testing in clinical trials by the time the trial readiness study is completed. for the purpose of this initiative, clinical trial readiness can include two categories of projects:1) those that define the presentation and course of the rare disease (e.g., natural history studies including retrospective projects, and longitudinal or cross-sectional approaches), in ways that are essential for the design of upcoming clinical trials.2) those that utilize sensitive, reliable, valid, and responsive tools to identify or select appropriate participants for clinical trials or to measure the effects of interventions. these tools include coa measures and biomarkers. investigators are encouraged to use or modify existing resources, validate existing tools in specific rare disease populations, or add components to existing disease-specific tools (such as symptom scales).this foa will support applications for testing of biomarkers or outcome measures so that they are ready for use in multi-site studies. biochemical or molecular biomarkers should include justification that describes accuracy, precision, analytical sensitivity, analytical specificity including interfering substances, dynamic range, and expected normal values. for imaging, radiological, or physiological biomarkers, the justification should provide preliminary data on the accuracy, reproducibility, sensitivity, and specificity as determined by study of a patient cohort (but not necessarily in the same rare disease). an appropriate study could start with a small, manageable set of well-justified candidate biomarkers, and based on data acquired during the study, be narrowed down to one or a few appropriate biomarkers to better characterize or validate for use in a clinical trial.examples of studies intended to be supported through this foa include, but are not limited to, the following:applications investigating the following will be considered non-responsive to this foa. non-responsive applications will be returned without review:leveraging existing research resourcesapplicants should leverage existing research resources for their clinical trial readiness studies. such resources may include existing clinical research networks such as rdcrn, neuronext, or other existing networks that have successfully conducted studies of rare diseases. also, applicants should leverage existing research resources to streamline multi-center studies, such as the smart irb. leveraging the resources and support from advocacy groups, private research foundations, academic institutions, other government agencies, and the nih intramural program are also encouraged. researchers interested in conducting trial readiness studies through rdcrn should contact the ncats scientific/research contact listed in the agency contacts section below early in the process of designing the study.studies that leverage the resources of ongoing clinical trials or longitudinal studies supported through other federal or private funds are also encouraged. researchers may consider collecting data to validate new or improved coa measures or biomarkers as ancillary studies to ongoing clinical trials or longitudinal studies.investigators are encouraged to collect the clinical data needed to apply to the fda for qualification of biomarkers or coas intended to be used in the regulatory review process. researchers are encouraged to seek advice from the fda on the development of the coa or biomarker. the fda provides additional information about the drug development tool qualification programs on its website.see section viii. other information for award

the instructions for the data management and sharing plan. all applications, regardless of the amount of direct costs requested for any one year, must address a data management and sharing plan.all instructions in the sf424 (r&r) application guide must be followed, with the following additional instructions:research strategy:evidence supporting rare disease classification – the significance section of the research strategy must include a paragraph with the heading, "evidence supporting rare disease classification". if the application does not include this section, then it will be considered incomplete and will not be reviewed. this section should provide the evidence that the disease/condition being studied is classified as a rare disease; i.e., there are 200,000 or fewer patients in the u.s. this section may include one or more references confirming the prevalence of the disease/condition that is the primary focus of the research application. if the disease/condition has been granted orphan status by the fda, provide this information in this paragraph. if it is a rare variant or subset of a more common condition, provide the rationale for focusing a trial readiness study on this variant. describe the scientific basis for separating biomarker/clinical outcome assessment (coa) validation for this rare variant or subset from that of the common condition.for studies involving human subjects, include a description of the sex/gender, race, and ethnicity of affected individuals and a plan to match enrollment to the demographic data. for example, data on the demographics of patients currently seen at the enrollment sites can be included, or include demographic data on patients surveyed to assess their willingness to participate in research.need for clinical trial readiness – the significance section of the research strategy must also include a subsection with the heading, "urgent need for clinical trial readiness". if the application does not include this subsection, then it will be considered incomplete and will not be reviewed. this subsection should describe the need for conducting the trial readiness study at this time, or how the project addresses a critical barrier or bottleneck to progress toward clinical trials. applicants should describe the clinical trial design issues (e.g., biomarker or coa validation, data for power calculations, defining inclusion/exclusion criteria, determining the duration of the trial, etc.) that will be addressed by this trial readiness study. describe the potential impact of the proposed studies in addressing significant needs in the design and increasing the likelihood of success of upcoming clinical trials.this section should also contain the following:biomarkers and their context of useif biomarker validation is proposed, the approach section of the application must contain a subsection with the heading, "biomarkers and their context of use". this section could describe each biomarker that will be tested for validation and the context of use (cou). the cou should explain how, when, and why the biomarker is to be used in a clinical trial.biochemical/molecular biomarkers must have analytical validation before applying for a clinical trial readiness award through this program. applications should include a table listing each biochemical/molecular biomarker to be tested for clinical validation, the intended use (e.g., diagnostic, predictive, treatment response, pharmacodynamic), the method of the assay (e.g., mass spectrometry, elisa, surface plasmon resonance), the sensitivity, dynamic range, and expected normal values. other characteristics of the assay such as accuracy, precision, specificity including interfering substances, etc. should also be described in the text of this subsection. describe what a graph of each biomarker measurement over time is expected to show (e.g., linearly decreasing measurement, sigmoidal curve, etc.) and the expected relationship of the biomarker to coa measures (e.g., inversely proportional).for imaging, radiological, or physiological biomarkers, the rationale should provide preliminary data on the accuracy, reproducibility, sensitivity, and specificity as determined by study of a patient cohort (but not necessarily in the same disease). describe the equipment (i.e., instrument manufacturer and model) and expertise available at each clinical site for measuring the biomarker(s). plans for the training of personnel at each site in the use of the standardized protocols, data quality control strategies, reference standards and approaches for verifying instrument calibration at the clinical sites should also be described as appropriate.clinical outcome assessment measuresclinical outcome assessment (coa) measures can be clinician-, observer-, or patient-reported, or performance outcomes. if coa measure validation is proposed, applications must provide a list of each coa measure that the study aims to clinically validate. describe the construct validity (i.e., hypothesized relationship with other disease characteristics) and content validity (i.e., extent to which the coa measures the concept of interest) for each coa measure. describe plans for analysis of test-retest and inter-rater reliability. describe rasch analysis for coa measure optimization if appropriate.natural history studiesstudies of the natural history of the disease may only be proposed for the purpose of developing readiness for upcoming clinical trials. if a natural history study is proposed, provide a rationale for how the natural history study will support advancement of the development of a rare disease medical product through characterization of an aspect of the disease natural history that must be addressed before a clinical trial can be planned or initiated (such as characterization of an external control group, identification of genotypic or phenotypic subpopulations necessary for defining inclusion/exclusion criteria, or other components of study design), and that the natural history study can address this characterization within the study timeframe.statistical analysis plansa section describing the plans for statistical analysis of the data and tests for validation of biomarkers/coas or analysis of the natural history study results should be included in the application. explain the decision for selecting the statistical analysis methods—what methods were considered; why were the proposed methods chosen. describe sample size considerations for validating the biomarkers and coas, or disease natural history characterization proposed. statistical analysis of convergent validity of coa measures and biomarkers is often an important component of trial readiness studies. describe which biomarkers and coa measures will be tested for convergent validity if appropriate for the study.existing clinical networksapplications should briefly describe the clinical network(s) that currently exist. for example, what infrastructure is already developed to enroll and conduct clinic visits for the proposed study?for ancillary studies, briefly describe the aims of the parent study and the timeline of the parent study relative to the proposed ancillary study. the application should discuss the additional burden to the participants of the parent study and whether consent obtained from the participants is adequate to cover the ancillary study or if additional consent must be obtained. (see also letters of support)letters of supportprovide letters of collaboration from individuals who will contribute in a substantive, meaningful way to the scientific development or execution of the project, whether or not salaries are requested. as appropriate, letters should document access to expertise, equipment and/or patients.for ancillary studies, provide a letter of support from the pd/pi of the parent study that includes:resource sharing plan: individuals are required to comply with the instructions for the resource sharing plans as provided in the sf424 (r&r) application guide.the following modifications also apply:with the following modifications:when involving human subjects research, clinical research, and/or nih-defined clinical trials (and when applicable, clinical trials

patient registries, and other human subject research to facilitate broader and more effective use of data and advance research across studies. cdes are data elements that have been identified and defined for use in multiple data sets across different studies. use of cdes can facilitate data sharing and standardization to improve data quality and enable data integration from multiple studies and sources, including electronic health records. nih ics have identified cdes for many clinical domains (e.g., neurological disease), types of studies (e.g. genome-wide association studies (gwas)), types of outcomes (e.g., patient-reported outcomes), and patient registries (e.g., the global rare diseases patient registry and data repository). nih has established a “common data element (cde) resource portal" (http://cde.nih.gov) to assist investigators in identifying nih-supported cdes when developing protocols, case report forms, and other instruments for data collection. the portal provides guidance about and access to nih-supported cde initiatives and other tools and resources for the appropriate use of cdes and data standards in nih-funded research. investigators are encouraged to consult the portal and describe in their applications any use they will make of nih-supported cdes in their projects.applicants are required to follow the instructions for post-submission materials, as described in the policy. any instructions provided here are in addition to the instructions in the policy.1. criterianote: effective for due dates on or after january 25,
