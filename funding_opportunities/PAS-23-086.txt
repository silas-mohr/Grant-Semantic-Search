- new grant application instructions now availablesee section iii. 3. additional information on eligibility.this funding opportunity announcement encourages the submission of pilot and feasibility clinical trials conducted in humans that will lay the foundation for larger clinical trials related to the prevention and/or treatment of diseases and conditions within the mission of niddk. the program will support small, short-term proof-of-concept clinical trials in humans to acquire preliminary data regarding the effects of the intervention, as well as feasibility data related to recruitment and retention, and study conduct. applications for clinical trials submitted under this foa should have clearly described aims and objectives, and have a high likelihood that the trial findings will lead to more definitive, hypothesis-driven trials to improve understanding, diagnosis, prevention or treatment of the diseases studied and have the potential to impact clinical practice and/or public health. preliminary data regarding intervention efficacy are not required.not applicableall applications are due by 5:00 pm local time of applicant organization.applicants are encouraged to apply early to allow adequate time to make any corrections to errors found in the application during the submission process by the due date.not applicableit is critical that applicants follow the instructions in the research (r) instructions in the sf424 (r&r) application guide, except where instructed to do otherwise (in this foa or in a notice from nih guide for grants and contracts).conformance to all requirements (both in the application guide and the foa) is required and strictly enforced. applicants must read and follow all application instructions in the application guide as well as any program-specific instructions noted in section iv. when the program-specific instructions deviate from those in the application guide, follow the program-specific instructions.applications that do not comply with these instructions may be delayed or not accepted for review.there are several options available to submit your application through grants.gov to nih and department of health and human services partners. you must use one of these submission options to access the application forms for this opportunity.improving prevention and treatment of disease typically requires conducting large clinical trials to ensure efficacy and safety of the proposed intervention. the first step in developing a clinical trial is often exploratory, short-term work to begin to investigate new ideas. the regulatory and financial burden of obtaining preliminary data as part of a pilot study for a large clinical trial can narrow the trial pipeline prematurely and inhibit innovation. this foa invites submission of pilot and feasibility clinical trials conducted in humans that will lay the foundation for larger clinical trials related to the prevention and/or treatment of diseases within the mission of niddk. the program will support small, short-term proof-of-concept clinical trials in humans to acquire preliminary data regarding the effects of the intervention, and feasibility data related to recruitment and retention of participants, as well as study conduct. the long-term objective of this foa is to accelerate the initiation of clinical trials to understand, prevent and/or treat diseases and conditions within the mission of niddk by facilitating smaller studies that do not have a stringent requirement for preliminary data in order to investigate new ideas for future clinical trials.niddk is committed to improving the health of people with diabetes and other endocrine and metabolic diseases; digestive diseases, nutritional disorders, and obesity; and kidney, urologic and hematologic diseases.this foa will support 3-year r01s for pilot and feasibility clinical trials where there is evidence supporting the scientific premise and sufficient justification of operational feasibility to conduct a pilot. there should be data from the pd/pi or from the literature to support the premise and rationale for the trial. there should be evidence that the pd/pi or co-investigators have the requisite knowledge, skills and experience to conduct the trial. however, preliminary data, particularly regarding intervention efficacy, are not required. applications for clinical trials submitted under this foa should have the potential to lead to a definitive trial that would be hypothesis-driven; the pilot trial should have clearly described aims and objectives. in general, the goal of these pilot studies would be to acquire data to support the rationale, design and/or feasibility of a definitive study. although these trials do not need to be powered, the study should assess the primary disease outcome of interest for a future fully powered study. preliminary data for intervention efficacy may be ascertained by assessing trends, or by assessing biomarkers and/or intermediary outcomes. aside from generating preliminary data on intervention efficacy, a key aspect of these initial studies would be assessing protocol feasibility issues so that operational hurdles can be addressed before the conduct of a larger clinical trial, potentially leading to stronger fully powered trials. although some formative work may be appropriate, the purpose of this foa is to support pilot and feasibility testing of the proposed intervention and not intervention development. the expectation would be that the proposed clinical trial, if successful, would lead to an application to support a larger, fully powered trial affecting important health outcomes. these definitive studies should improve understanding, diagnosis, prevention or treatment of the diseases or conditions studied and have the potential to impact clinical practice and/or public health.nih defines a clinical trial as “a research study in which one or more human subjects are prospectively assigned to one or more interventions (which may include placebo or other control) to evaluate the effects of those interventions on health-related biomedical or behavioral outcomes" (https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/not-od-15-015.html). applications submitted to this foa may propose either therapeutic or mechanistic clinical trials (including basic experimental studies with humans (besh)). a therapeutic trial has a goal of determining clinical safety, tolerability, efficacy and/or effectiveness of an intervention designed to prevent or treat a disease or condition. such studies may be pragmatic trials where the intervention is tested under the usual conditions in which it will be applied, or explanatory trials where the intervention is tested under idealized circumstances. mechanistic trials are designed to understand a biologic process, the pathophysiology of a disease, or the mechanism of action of an intervention.many of the diseases or conditions within the mission of niddk disproportionately affect individuals from racial and ethnic minority groups, the socioeconomically disadvantaged and underserved rural populations. niddk encourages research focusing on minority and underserved populations and places a high priority on clinical trials to mitigate or eliminate health disparities and achieve health equity. niddk also has an expectation that recruitment for clinical trials will reflect the population in the u.s. that is at risk for/has the disease or condition being studied.all investigators are expected to include meaningful engagement approaches with the relevant research population in designing and implementing the proposed trial. this may involve engagement with patients, family members or caregivers, community members, community-based organization, clinicians, health care systems, or other relevant stakeholders throughout the research process. meaningful engagement must entail more than focus groups, surveys, or other activities where stakeholders are only involved as participants or respondents. engagement must be designed to ensure that the research is practical and aligns with stakeholders’ preferences and values. meaningful collaboration will lead to optimal trial recruitment and conduct as well as potential for future dissemination and sustainability.this foa will only accept research within the mission of niddk. research applications in areas that are primarily within the missions of other nih institutes and centers are not appropriate for this foa and will not be reviewed. niddk has many research areas within its mission, but all research related to relevant diseases may not be appropriate for niddk. applicants to this foa are strongly encouraged to contact niddk staff as soon as possible in the development of the application, so that niddk staff can help the applicant understand whether the proposed clinical trial is within the goals and mission of the institute and is appropriate for this foa.applicants are reminded of the nih policy on the use of a single institutional review board for multi-center clinical trials (see https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/not-od-21-174.html) as well as the nih policy on the registration and reporting of the results of clinical trials (https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/not-od-16-149.html).the niddk strongly encourages research on sex/gender differences, sexual and gender minority-related research and race/ethnic diversity (see not-dk-22-003).applications not responsive to this foathe following types of studies are not responsive to this foa. applications proposing such studies will be considered

instructions by the center for scientific review and responsiveness by niddk, nih. applications that are incomplete or non-compliant will not be reviewed.use of common data elements in nih-funded researchmany nih ics encourage the use of common data elements (cdes) in basic, clinical, and applied research, patient registries, and other human subject research to facilitate broader and more effective use of data and advance research across studies. cdes are data elements that have been identified and defined for use in multiple data sets across different studies. use of cdes can facilitate data sharing and standardization to improve data quality and enable data integration from multiple studies and sources, including electronic health records. nih ics have identified cdes for many clinical domains (e.g., neurological disease), types of studies (e.g. genome-wide association studies (gwas)), types of outcomes (e.g., patient-reported outcomes), and patient registries (e.g., the global rare diseases patient registry and data repository). nih has established a “common data element (cde) resource portal" (http://cde.nih.gov/) to assist investigators in identifying nih-supported cdes when developing protocols, case report forms, and other instruments for data collection. the portal provides guidance about and access to nih-supported cde initiatives and other tools and resources for the appropriate use of cdes and data standards in nih-funded research. investigators are encouraged to consult the portal and describe in their applications any use they will make of nih-supported cdes in their projects.post submission materialsapplicants are required to follow the instructions for post-submission materials, as described in the policy1. criteriaonly the review criteria described below will be considered in the review process. applications submitted to the nih in support of the nih mission are evaluated for scientific and technical merit through the nih peer review system.note: effective for due dates on or after january 25, 2023, the data sharing plan and genomic data sharing plan (gds) will not be evaluated at time of review.a proposed clinical
