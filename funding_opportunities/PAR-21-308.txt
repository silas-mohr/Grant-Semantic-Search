national institutes of health (nih)national institute on aging (nia)r61/r33 exploratory/developmental phased awardsee notices of special interest associated with this funding opportunitysee section iii. 3. additional information on eligibility.this funding opportunity announcement (foa) will support pragmatic trials within stage iv of the nih stage model to improve dementia care across multiple dementia care settings that will: (1) be designed to address practical comparative questions faced by alzheimer’s disease (ad) and ad-related dementia (adrd) patients, clinicians, and caregivers (both paid and unpaid); (2) include broad and diverse populations; and (3) be conducted in real-world settings with adequate sample size. these trials are intended to produce results that can be directly adopted by healthcare providers, patients, or caregivers for rapid dissemination and implementation. successful applications will: (1) improve quality of care of persons with dementia; (2) improve quality of life for persons with dementia and their informal caregivers; (3) deliver more patient-focused, cost-effective care across multiple settings; and/or (4) reduce disparities in dementia care.this foa will support stage i or stage iii pilot research to test the feasibility of implementing and integrating interventions (r61 phase) that, if successful, can transition to an r33 phase (stage iv) for implementation of large pragmatic trials.the transition from the r61 to the r33 phase of the award will be administratively reviewed and determined by successful completion of the go/no-go criteria that are specified for the r61 phase.30 days prior to the application due dateall applications are due by 5:00 pm local time of applicant organization. all types of non-aids applications allowed for this funding opportunity announcement are due on the listed date(s).applicants are encouraged to apply early to allow adequate time to make any corrections to errors found in the application during the submission process by the due date.not applicableit is critical that applicants follow the instructions in the research (r) instructions in the sf424 (r&r) application guide, except where instructed to do otherwise (in this foa or in a notice from nih guide for grants and contracts).conformance to all requirements (both in the application guide and the foa) is required and strictly enforced. applicants must read and follow all application instructions in the application guide as well as any program-specific instructions noted in section iv. when the program-specific instructions deviate from those in the application guide, follow the program-specific instructions.applications that do not comply with these instructions may be delayed or not accepted for review.there are several options available to submit your application through grants.gov to nih and department of health and human services partners. you must use one of these submission options to access the application forms for this opportunity.backgroundthe nia ad/adrd research implementation milestones highlight the need for “novel and innovative dissemination and implementation methods to scale up promising practices in dementia care across settings and across disease severity spectrum” (milestone 13.h). a recent evidence review conducted by the agency for healthcare research and quality (ahrq) on “care interventions for people living with dementia and their caregivers” underscored the need for rigorous, well-powered, replicable research addressing issues of intervention fidelity, efficacy, and potential intervention mechanisms, prior to dissemination and implementation on a wide scale. this funding opportunity announcement (foa) is intended to address challenges highlighted in this evidence review by calling for activities that can lay the groundwork for principle-based ad/adrd care and caregiving interventions that can be delivered with fidelity in the real world. the activities called for in this foa are designed to facilitate the success of these trials by providing additional steppingstones toward ultimate implementation.this foa will support pragmatic trials within stage iv of the nih stage model that will: 1) be designed to address practical comparative questions faced by alzheimer’s disease (ad) and ad-related dementia (adrd) patients, clinicians, and caregivers (both paid and unpaid); 2) include broad and diverse populations; and 3) be conducted in real-world settings in order to improve dementia care across multiple dementia care settings. trials of interest to nia are those which can provide insight leading to improvements in clinical outcomes and lessening of caregiver burden, and which can be directly adopted by healthcare providers, patients, or caregivers. they should be conducted, where possible, in routine clinical or home care settings, with adequate sample sizes to detect clinically significant differences in meaningful outcomes and should, where appropriate, address effectiveness across diverse populations.this par utilizes the nih stage model as its conceptual framework:some impediments to implementation are specific to the intervention itself, such as deficiencies in (1) knowledge of the underlying mechanism(s) or critical components of the intervention or the implementation strategy for disseminating the intervention, and (2) methods to ensure fidelity of delivery of the intervention in the community, including scalable, tested, and validated training materials for complex interventions that are designed specifically for individuals in the community.the nih stage model for behavioral intervention development is intended to address these impediments. it has the goal of creating efficacious, ultimately implementable interventions defined by their principles and offers a framework for describing where an intervention is in the developmental pipeline and specifies appropriate research activities within different stages of intervention development. the model facilitates discussion of intervention development research by applicants, reviewers, and funders with a common language. an understanding of the mechanisms of action or the principles underlying an intervention is inherent in the nih stage model.for this foa, pragmatic trials should assess an intervention in the conditions in which it is intended to be used, rather than in ideal circumstances (see "introduction to pragmatic clinical trials"; “rethinking clinical trials: a living textbook of pragmatic trials” and nia ad/adrd health care systems research collaboratory). trials of interventions that require training to ensure fidelity of delivery, where the validation of training materials has not yet been conducted, should be submitted to par-21-307.specific areas of research interestappropriate settings for pragmatic trials funded under this foa are home settings (e.g., interventions provided by home health agencies or meal delivery services), adult day centers, respite care centers, assisted living facilities, memory units, nursing homes, health care clinics, or nonresidential and residential settings. clinical trial designs with outcomes that use administrative data and/or measurements using technology (e.g., patient or caregiver reported outcomes using smartphone or other technology) to enhance generalizability are required. interventions can involve changes in services, staffing, and training (validated training materials required from previous studies or training materials need to be modified from previous studies during the r61 phase), environmental modifications, or service coordination, with quality of care and quality of life for persons with dementia and their informal caregivers assessed as primary outcomes. additional secondary outcomes can include the quality of work life and staff turnover for service-providing agencies. proposed applications can also collect and analyze data on the use of acute care, timing and frequency of transitions to acute care and rehabilitation settings, and multi-morbidity. pds/pis are encouraged to define outcomes and specify the cost associated with capturing outcomes data.potential interventions include, but are not limited to, the following:the trial outcome measure(s) should be clinically meaningful and provide useful information to medical decision makers, whether patients, care providers, health care systems, payers, or policy makers. outcome measures such as use of health care services, patient and caregiver reported outcomes and other resources should be included.research designthis foa seeks applications for two types of interventions, with two options for pathways through the stages of intervention development.two types of interventions:two options through the pathways of intervention development:the r61 phasethe applicant must include/address, as appropriate, the following activities and milestones for the r61 phase:the r33 implementation phase: stage iv pragmatic trialduring the r33 phase, the pd(s)/pi(s) will test the effectiveness of the intervention in a home/clinical setting. general activities for this phase include the following:milestones and r61/r33 transitionapplications must propose a well-defined set of milestones (see required milestones above) for the planning phase (r61) and annual milestones for the implementation phase (r33). specifically, the transition from the r61 to the r33 phase of the award will be administratively reviewed for successful completion of the go/no-go criteria that will be clearly specified in the r61 phase. generally, applications could include the following activities and milestones for the r61 phase:at the completion of the r61 phase, the applicant will be required to submit a detailed transition request for the r33 implementation phase. r33 transition requests will undergo an administrative review to determine whether the milestones have been met. unless the r61 meets go/no-go criteria, the r61 may not transition to the r33 phase.prospective applicants should note that funding of the r61 phase of a grant application does not guarantee support of the r33 phase. transition to the r33 phase of the project will occur only if an administrative review process recommends that the r61 planning activities have been successful, the implementation phase of the project can proceed with confidence of success, and funds are available.partnerships with application developers for smartphones and access to ehrspartnerships with application developers for collecting patients and caregiver reported outcomes, community partners, healthcare delivery organizations will be critical to implementing this foa. it is anticipated that interventions will generally be performed with either smartphones, sensors and/or administrative data (e.g., partnership with electronically-supported, integrated healthcare delivery organizations to establish efficiencies). the partnership must facilitate access to all ehr data sources relevant to the project (modifying the system when necessary). further, we encourage collaborations with retail application developers and ehr vendors to scale the adoption of successful interventions to solo and small-group practices.applications not responsive to this foathe following types of applications will be considered nonresponsive and will not be reviewed. this includes applications that:design, analysis, and sample size for studies to evaluate group-based interventions: investigators who wish to evaluate the effect of an intervention on a health-related biomedical or behavioral outcome may propose a study in which (1) groups or clusters are assigned to study arms and individual observations are analyzed to evaluate the effect of the intervention, or (2) participants are assigned individually to study arms but receive at least some of their intervention in a real or virtual group or through a shared facilitator. such studies may propose a parallel group- or cluster-randomized trial, an individually randomized group-treatment trial, a stepped-wedge design, or a quasi-experimental version of one of these designs. in these studies, special methods may be warranted for analysis and sample size estimation. applicants should show that their methods are appropriate given their plans for assignment of participants and delivery of interventions. additional information is available at https://researchmethodsresources.nih.gov/.the national institute on aging (nia) supports a central resource to nia staff and extramural investigators to facilitate/support the conduct and management of clinical research. this resource, the clinical research operations management system (croms), is a comprehensive data management system to support the business functions, management, and oversight responsibilities of nia grants that support the conduct of clinical research with human subjects. it is the expectation by nia that all successful applicants will interface, integrate, or adapt their information system(s) and processes to interact with existing and future components of the croms as necessary.see section viii. other information for award authorities and regulations.grant: a support mechanism providing money,

elements, as appropriate, that enhance its sensitivity, potential for information or potential to advance scientific knowledge or clinical practice.the application challenges and seeks to shift current behavioral intervention research or clinical dementia care practice paradigms by utilizing nih stage model.approachthe application provides an overview of the proposed study design which includes the stage of intervention research (e.g., stage i, iii, or iv of the nih stage model). the study design includes the rationale for the selected stage, including justification of the evidence from previous basic behavioral/social/affective/ cognitive research or previous relevant clinical trials. the study design addresses hypothesized principles or “mechanism of action” of the intervention, including the behavioral, cognitive, affective, or social targets it is hypothesized to engage. the application includes plans for addressing the fidelity of intervention delivery. the study design includes rationale for the intervention study design (e.g., single case study, multiple baseline, adaptive/smart design, factorial, partial factorial). the application provides an explanation of the hypothesized relevance of process variables (i.e., hypothesized causal targets) and outcome variables (i.e., ultimate behavior to be modified) to the clinical and statistical hypothesis being tested (i.e., the hypothesized role each variable play in the causal chain; specification of variables as hypothesized moderators, mediators, or outcomes). the study design addresses potential biases or challenges in the trial and how they will be addressed and mitigated. the application discusses potential threats to validity and presents clear power calculations that reflect a range of effect sizes of clinical significance. the application incorporates trial design with rigorous controls for stage of intervention proposed.the application describes a unifying and testable hypothesis that transcends both r61 and r33 phases. the application provides clear milestones for the r61 phase and related scientific goals for the r33 phase. those milestones are conducive to

(note that power calculations are not required for the r61 phase). the application provides the sample size, analytic plan, and overall design for the planned pragmatic trial. the application assesses and justifies adequacy of, and finalizes, clinically relevant outcome measures.for r61-stage i or iii, the design maximizes internal validity of the study. for r33-stage iv trials, the design maximizes external validity. the application summarizes how the study will test generalizability, and sustainability of findings across distinct health care settings and diverse staff, caregiver, and patient populations.the application provides a description of how the study designs, methods, and assessments are complementary, such that outcomes from the r61 phase will enhance the interpretation of outcomes for the r33 stage.the application describes the partnerships with home health agencies, meal delivery services, adult day centers, respite care centers, assisted living facilities, memory units, nursing homes or other care providers, both nonresidential and residential, and the application documents the commitment of the organization to the project. the application describes how the project will be able to access administrative data (e.g. medicare or medicaid claims or electronic health records) and implement pilot interventions in various settings (e.g. is there a letter of support if the application proposed to access ehr in a nursing home).research strategy: the research strategy should contain separate sections that describe both the r61 and r33 phases. separate research design and methods could be presented as needed for the r61 and r33 phases. it is not necessary to repeat information or details in the r33 section that are described in the r61 section.for

the proposed hypothesis or intervention well supported by preliminary data, clinical and/or preclinical studies, or information in the literature or knowledge of biological mechanisms? for trials focusing on clinical or public health endpoints, is this clinical trial necessary for testing the safety, efficacy or effectiveness of an intervention that could lead to a change in clinical practice, community behaviors or health care policy? for trials focusing on mechanistic, behavioral, physiological, biochemical, or other biomedical endpoints, is this trial needed to advance scientific understanding?are the pd(s)/pi(s), collaborators, and other researchers well suited to the project? if early stage investigators or those in the early stages of independent careers, do they have
