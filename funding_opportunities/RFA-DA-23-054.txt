eligibilitythe goal of this initiative is to support action-oriented research that accelerates the translation of research to practice to address the overdose crisis. there remains an urgent need for research that advances the design of stigma-free patient-centered systems of care such that people who experience addiction can recover and sustain their recovery over the long-term. this funding opportunity announcement (foa) solicits applications that address understudied areas of opportunity, particularly those that focus on fundamental barriers or facilitators to reducing overdose deaths at the individual, provider, organizational, community, or system levels. projects should be in alignment with the overall goals of the heal initiative, and should focus on replicable, scalable, equitable approaches for accelerating the movement of moving evidence-based and promising treatments into routine use. this foa invites projects for which preliminary or feasibility data is available. this foa is a companion to rfa-da-23-053, which solicits applications for which pilot data is unavailable.30 days prior to each application due date.all applications are due by 5:00 pm local time of applicant organization.applicants are encouraged to apply early to allow adequate time to make any corrections to errors found in the application during the submission process by the due date.not applicableit is critical that applicants follow the instructions in the research (r) instructions in the sf424 (r&r) application guide, except where instructed to do otherwise (in this foa or in a notice from nih guide for grants and contracts).conformance to all requirements (both in the application guide and the foa) is required and strictly enforced. applicants must read and follow all application instructions in the application guide as well as any program-specific instructions noted in section iv. when the program-specific instructions deviate from those in the application guide, follow the program-specific instructions.applications that do not comply with these instructions may be delayed or not accepted for review.there are several options available to submit your application through grants.gov to nih and department of health and human services partners. you must use one of these submission options to access the application forms for this opportunity.background: heal initiativein the 12-month period ending in april 2021, more than 100,000 people lost their lives to overdose deaths. deaths have continued to rise despite significant efforts and resources aimed at reversing these trends. research funded through the national institutes of health offers numerous promising approaches to responding to this entrenched public health crisis. however, research does not always readily translate to practice. to turn the tide on the overdose crisis, research is needed to address the systemic issues necessary to accelerate the translation of promising research findings to practice.this foa is part of the nih’s helping to end addiction long-term (heal) initiative to speed the development and implementation of scientific solutions to the national opioid public health crisis. the nih heal initiative will bolster research across nih to (1) improve treatment for opioid misuse and addiction and (2) enhance pain management. more information and periodic updates about the heal initiative are available at: https://heal.nih.gov/.purposethe goal of this foa is to support action-oriented research that accelerates the translation of research to practice to address the overdose crisis. there remains an urgent need for research to address understudied areas of opportunity, particularly addressing the fundamental barriers or facilitators to reducing overdose deaths at the individual, provider, organizational, community, or system levels. high priority areas are those that advance the goal of creating stigma-free patient-centered systems of care such that people who experience addiction can recover and sustain their recovery over the long-term.this foa is a companion to rfa-da-23-053 which also solicits applications relevant to the focus area. applicants should note the difference between these foas: rfa-da-23-053 solicits phased awards, which are most appropriate for projects that require 1-2 years for preparatory work such as collecting pilot data; obtaining and integrating existing data sets; building stakeholder engagement; developing, adapting, and testing the feasibility of key components of interventions or implementation strategies; building necessary infrastructure to support a larger trial (e.g., clinical alerts; recordkeeping systems); or similar activities upon which the subsequent phase would be dependent. phased awards do not require pilot or feasibility data at the time of submission. awards made under rfa-da-23-053 may transition to the second (r33) phase to conduct a larger study upon successfully meeting relevant milestones in the r61 phase. in contrast, rfa-da-23-054 (this foa) solicits applications that already have relevant preliminary, pilot, or feasibility data and are prepared to launch a larger study immediately upon award.proposed research under this foa must move beyond descriptive studies that enumerate factors that facilitate or impede the delivery of high-quality, effective addiction treatment services. rather, applications should seek to develop and test systematic strategies for equitably improving the quality of care for people who experience addiction.applications should attend to methods to accelerate the translation of insights generated by the proposed research into practice. methods such as implementation science, hybrid implementation/effectiveness trials, and dissemination research are critical tools for achieving this acceleration. applications must be innovative and should not focus on replicating previous findings. key elements that must be considered in all applications include:proposed projects must align with one or more of the following pillars of the hhs overdose prevention strategy: harm reduction, treatment of opioid use or stimulant use disorder, and recovery support. applications may also propose to explore issues relevant to the intersection opioid or stimulant misuse/use disorders and pain. applications that focus solely on primary prevention or opioid prescribing will not be considered responsive to this foa. applicants interested in primary prevention and opioid prescribing should respond to other relevant heal foas.studies may take place in a variety of settings including those in the sud treatment, general and specialty healthcare, criminal justice, social and human services, pain clinics, pharmacies, workplaces, and community settings. applicants are encouraged to consider nontraditional service delivery settings when these could potentially broaden the reach of evidence-based services to underserved populations and communities, including nih-designated health disparity populations and other groups that have historically experienced challenges in access to addiction services.this foa is a companion to rfa-da-23-053. together, these foas solicit applications relevant to the heal translation of research to practice for the treatment of opioid addiction team. periodically, additional notices of special interest will be released by the nih and published in the nih guide identifying specific high priority areas of interest relevant to these foas. in addition to areas of interest specified by such nosis, effectiveness, services, or implementation questions relevant to treatment of opioid use or stimulant use disorder, harm reduction, and recovery support are of general interest. examples of specific areas of interest include, but are not limited to:additional high priority topics may periodically be solicited under this foa through one or more notices of special interest, published in the nih guide.this foa will not support applications that seek to develop and test the efficacy of novel addiction treatments or similar clinical interventions or new prevention interventions.pre-application consultationpotential applicants are strongly encouraged to consult with appropriate nih program staff early in the application development process. this early contact will provide an opportunity to discuss and clarify nih policies and guidelines, including the scope of the project relative to the heal initiative mission and intent of this foa.special considerations:the following applications will be considered non-responsive and will not be reviewed:data harmonization for substance abuse and addiction via the phenx toolkit: nida strongly encourages investigators involved in human-subjects studies to employ a common set of tools and resources that will promote the collection of comparable data across studies and to do so by incorporating the measures from the core and specialty collections, which are available in the substance abuse and addiction collection of the phenx toolkit (www.phenxtoolkit.org). please see not-da-12-008 (https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/not-da-12-008.html) for further details.there are also opportunities to harmonize data within the broader nih heal initiative. applicants selected for funding should expect to have a conversation with nih program staff early in their project regarding high priority areas for potential harmonization.nih heal requirements: the nih heal initiative will require a high level of coordination and sharing between investigators. it is expected that nih heal initiative recipients will cooperate and coordinate their activities after awards are made by participating in program director/principal investigator (pd/pi) meetings, including an annual nih heal investigators meeting, as well as other activities.diversity: in addition to scientific diversity, applicants should strive to incorporate diversity in their team development plan. research shows that diverse teams working together and capitalizing on innovative ideas and distinct perspectives outperform homogenous teams. scientists and trainees from diverse backgrounds and life experiences bring different perspectives, creativity, and individual enterprise to address complex scientific problems. there are many benefits that flow from a diverse nih-supported scientific workforce, including: fostering scientific innovation, enhancing global competitiveness, contributing to robust learning environments, improving the quality of the research, advancing the likelihood that underserved or health disparity populations participate in, and benefit from health research, and enhancing public trust. please refer to notice of nih's interest in diversity not-od-20-031 for more details.points to consider regarding tobacco industry funding of nida applicants: the national advisory council on drug abuse (nacda) encourages nida and its grantees to consider the points it has set forth with regard to existing or prospective sponsored research agreements with tobacco companies or their related entities and the impact of acceptance of tobacco industry funding on nida's credibility and reputation within the scientific community. please see (http://ww2.drugabuse.gov/about/organization/nacda/points-to-consider.html) for details.national institute of mental health (nimh) areas of specific interest and nimh-specific instructionsthe national institute of mental health (nimh) is interested in applications to address relevant to priorities described in goal 4 of the nimh strategic plan for research and the following notices of special interest to benefit people with oud and co-occurring mental health conditions and/or suicide risk:for assignment to and funding consideration at nimh, applicants should include “not-da-23-007" or “not-da-23-008" (without quotation marks) in the agency routing identifier field (box 4b) of the sf424 r&r form. applications that do not include this information will not be assigned to nimh.all applications that propose clinical trials and that seek funding consideration at nimh should follow the nimh’s experimental therapeutics approach to intervention development and testing (see https://www.nimh.nih.gov/funding/opportunities-announcements/clinical-trials-foas/index.shtml). that is, the scope of work must include specification of targets/mechanisms and assessment of intervention induced changes in the presumed targets/mechanisms that are hypothesized to account for the intervention’s outcomes. in this manner, the results of the trial will advance knowledge regarding therapeutic change mechanisms and be informative regardless of trial outcomes (e.g., in the event of negative results, information about whether the intervention was successful at engaging its targets can facilitate interpretation).nimh is committed to supporting research that reduces disparities and advances equity in mental health interventions, services, and outcomes. accordingly, this foa encourages research studies that seek to reduce disparities for racial and ethnic minority groups, individuals limited by language or cultural barriers, sexual and gender minorities, individuals living in rural areas, socioeconomically disadvantaged persons and other underserved groups.nimh encourages a deployment-focused model of intervention and services design and evaluation that takes into account the perspective of relevant stakeholders (e.g., service users, providers, administrators, payers) and the key characteristics of the settings (e.g., resources, including workforce capacity; existing clinical workflows) that are intended to implement optimized mental health interventions. this attention to end-user perspectives and characteristics of intended clinical and/or community practice settings is intended to ensure the resultant interventions and service delivery strategies are acceptable to consumers and providers, the approaches are feasible and scalable in the settings where individuals are served, and the research results will have utility for end users.nimh encourages research on potentially scalable preventive, therapeutic, and services interventions that focuses on practice-relevant questions. accordingly, collaborations between academic researchers and clinical or community practice partners or networks are encouraged. when possible, studies should capitalize on existing infrastructure (e.g., practice-based research networks such as the nimh-sponsored mental health research network (mhrn), electronic medical records, administrative data bases, patient registries, institutions with clinical and translational science awards) to increase the efficiency of participant recruitment (i.e., more rapid identification and enrollment) and to facilitate the collection of moderator data (e.g., clinical characteristics, biomarkers), longer-term follow-up data, and broader, stakeholder-relevant outcomes (e.g., mental health and general health care utilization, value and efficiency of intervention approaches).see section viii. other information for award authorities and regulations.investigators proposing nih-defined clinical trials may refer to the research methods resources website for information about developing statistical methods and study designs.grant: a support mechanism providing money, property, or both
