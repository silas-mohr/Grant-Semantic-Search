june 3, 2021par-19-274 - dissemination and implementation research in health (r01 clinical trial optional)not-od-19-122 - fast healthcare interoperability resources (fhirÂ®) standardnot-od-16-025 - clarifying nih priorities for health economics researchnational heart, lung, and blood institute (nhlbi)this notice of special interest (nosi) is intended to stimulate the use of behavioral economics strategies for implementation research (beir) in order to develop more effective strategies for implementaion of evidence-based practices (ebp) to address heart, lung, blood, and sleep (hlbs) conditions. nhlbi encourages applications that recognize the importance of cultural context, patterns of behavior change, and motivators for change across decision-making levels, including individuals (e.g., patients, parents, clinicians, others), groups, healthcare systems and/or communities. applications that focus on the use of behavioral economics to develop implementation strategies for user-driven, sustainable interventions that may be simplified and minimally disruptive when possible are encouraged. applications may propose either a clinical trial or non-clinical trial design, as appropriate to the research objectives.scopemore effective implementation strategies can be developed when motivators of behavior change are understood and that information is incorporated within the implementation strategy. the interface of behavioral economics and implementation research (beir) can facilitate the development of an implementation strategy which is explicitly designed and maintained to optimize the desired behaviors (i.e., actions) with ease, efficiency, and consistency, once the desired outcome(s) and the recommended behaviors/action(s) needed to support those desired outcomes (as specified in an ebp) have been identified. beir studies are designed to reflect the realities of human behavior and employ heuristics, or mental shortcuts, to make decisions. behavioral economics strategies include performance assessment; choice architecture; hovering (i.e., observation); incentives, including behavioral nudges; maintaining consistency; making harms more immediate/salient; modelling behavior; remuneration; social proofs, and more. effective beir strategies recognize the importance of cultural context and patterns of behavior change. beir implementation strategies can be multi-level and/or multi-actor and/or span across levels of patients, care providers, groups, and/or system-wide procedures.collaborations among multiple disciplines are encouraged for this nosi, including implementation scientists, behavioral health experts, social-psychologists, shared-decision making analysts, professional training, organizational-change experts, health system analysts, methodologists, etc. the community-based stakeholders, decision makers, and other end-users (e.g., clinicians, public health analysts, patients, parents, clinicians, public health analysts, patient representatives) are welcome along the research continuum, from initial study conception to dissemination and implementation.applicants are encouraged to clearly identify the hlbs ebp for which the behavioral economic strategies will be applied in the implementation research project. the development and dissemination of the implementation strategy plan should include reusable infrastructure such as national standards for data extraction and interoperability (e.g., findability, accessibility, interoperability, and reusability; fair (see not-od-19-122), as well as observational medical outcomes partnership (omop) common data model (cdm) (see https://www.ohdsi.org/data-standardization/the-common-data-model/) so that the approach may be replicated longitudinally and allow others to adapt the implementation strategies. applicants are encouraged to become familiar with the most-recent nih strategic plan for data science ( https://datascience.nih.gov/sites/default/files/nih_strategic_plan_for_data_science_final_508.pdf , november 2020).behavioral economics analyses are distinct from traditional economic analyses, but applicants may choose to include both approaches in the proposed implementation research project . applicants seeking to include economic analyses are encouraged to review not-od-16-025 for the nih policy related to funding health economics research.prospective applicants are encouraged to direct inquiries to the appropriate nlhbi scientific research contact(s) listed below to ensure that the proposed aims are consistent with nhlbi's mission and to advise on the nih's criteria for defining a clinical trial.research projects proposed in response to this nosi that seek to improve decisions made toward achieving improved fulfillment of hlbs-related ebp could include, but are not limited to the following:nhlbi strongly encourages applications that specify the ebp for which an intervention strategy will be developed and tested.application and submission informationthis notice applies to due dates on or after . 10/05/2021submit applications for this nosi using the following funding opportunity announcement (foa) or any reissues of this announcement through the expiration date of this notice.applications nonresponsive to terms of this nosi will not be considered for the nosi initiative.scientific/research contact(s)sue shero, rn, ms center for translation research and implementation science national heart, lung and blood institute (nhlbi) telephone: 301-496-1051 email:susan.shero@nih.govmichelle m. freemer, md, mph division of lung diseases national heart, lung and blood institute (nhlbi) telephone:301-435-0233 email:michelle.freemer@nih.govkathleen fenton, md, mph division of cardiovascular sciences national heart, lung and blood institute (nhlbi) telephone:301.827.6523 email:kathleen.fenton@nih.govpeer review contact(s)examine your era commons account for review assignment and contact information (information appears two weeks after the submission due date).financial/grants management contact(s)anthony agresti national heart, lung, and blood institute (nhlbi) telephone: 301-435-0186 email:agrestia@nhlbi.nih.govweekly toc for this announcement nih funding opportunities and noticesnote: for help accessing pdf, rtf, ms word, excel, powerpoint, audio or video files, see help downloading files.
