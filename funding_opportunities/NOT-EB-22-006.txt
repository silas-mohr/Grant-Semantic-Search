nibib guidance for support of clinical trial applicationsnational institute of biomedical imaging and bioengineering (nibib)the purpose of this notice is to inform potential applicants to the national institute of biomedical imaging and bioengineering (nibib) of an area of special interest in developing nuclear medicine imaging technologies to achieve more cost-efficient clinical single-photon emission computerized tomography (spect) applications.backgroundover the past few decades there have been a number of advances in spect instrumentation, including spect/computer tomography (spect/ct) , collimators that have shown improved spatial resolution in small animal imagers (promising spatial resolution in the (tens of) micron range in clinical applications), and attenuation correction algorithms that have improved absolute quantitation methods. because, the spatial resolution of spect is limited only by the camera performance, not by the characteristics of the radiotracer, it has the possibility to deliver sub-millimeter clinical resolution within the patient. also, given the variety of single photon emitting radioisotopes, spect can simultaneously image more than just one physiologic function in humans. finally, an advantage of spect imaging is its lower camera cost compared to positron emission tomography (pet) cameras. as new imaging agents become available and established, it is anticipated that spect radiopharmaceutical costs would also decrease through increased demand.over the past decades nuclear cardiology has demonstrated that spect imaging provides a highly cost-effective method for delivering clinical tomographic imaging and diagnosis and has spurred the development of dedicated cardiac imaging cameras now made available by the leading manufacturers. fda approval of new cardiac spect radiopharmaceuticals are distributed world-wide for use in patient-based studies and are used as a gold standard for evaluating new therapies and cardiac interventions in clinical trials. spect has the capability to deliver the same advantages for other organ systems and diseases; of particular interest is in brain imaging for dementia studies and neuroscience as well as alpha- and electron-emitting targeted cancer therapy, due to the recent interest of these fields in the community.current practices in clinical patient-based, non-cardiac nuclear medicine studies rely on image acquisitions that quantify tracer uptake as a standard uptake value (suv) . this logic is also applied to the methods used to measure proteinopathies in brain with the amyloid and tau imaging agents, and almost all amyloid and tau imaging studies report the data as suv measures. the same is true for emerging next generation oncology imaging agents.although pet, using c-11 labeling, is the optimal method for evaluating new radiolabeled molecules, spect can play a role in making analogs of these molecules broadly and inexpensively available for clinical applications. that is, pet remains focused on imaging protocols that require its current superior temporal resolution and sensitivity (i.e., imaging biomarkers having a low target density), and spect could contribute to procedures where delayed “hot spot” imaging (suv-based quantitation) is used for a diagnosis or therapy efficacy evaluations. this would lead to reducing the cost of clinical trials and hospital-based imaging.nibib statement of interest and research objectivesto decrease the cost of clinical trials and hospital patient diagnostics and new therapies, nibib is interested in supporting the development of new spect imaging technologies and spect analogues of the many available pet radiopharmaceuticals. topics identified as high interest include, but are not limited to developing new imaging probes, and instrumentation, such as:application and submission informationthis notice applies to due dates on or after june 5, 2022 and subsequent receipt dates through may 8, 2024.applications in response to this notice must be submitted through one of the following opportunity announcements (foas) (or subsequently reissued equivalents).pa-20-183 -
