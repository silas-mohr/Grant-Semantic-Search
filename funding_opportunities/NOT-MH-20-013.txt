institute of mental health (nimh)purposethe national institute of mental health is issuing this notice to highlight interest in receiving grant applications focused on understanding and addressing the impact of mental health comorbidities, including mental health disorders as well as violence and trauma, on the hiv prevention and treatment continua.in the u.s. and globally, mental disorders are prevalent among populations at risk for hiv acquisition and transmission, as well as people living with hiv (plhiv). exposure to violent or traumatic events is frequently comorbid with mental health disorders, and also impacts the hiv prevention and treatment continua. mental disorders and violence/trauma are associated with increased hiv acquisition and transmission risk behaviors, and they may be a barrier to the uptake of hiv prevention tools such as hiv testing and pre-exposure prophylaxis (prep), as well as hiv care and treatment.there are numerous evidence-based interventions to improve mental health; however, there are gaps in our understanding of how to best address mental health comorbidities in the context of hiv prevention and treatment. the effect of efficacious mental health interventions on hiv prevention and treatment outcomes is mixed, and efficacious mental health treatment may need to be combined with effective hiv prevention and care interventions to maximally improve mental health and hiv outcomes. some populations, such as perinatal women, have unique biopsychosocial factors that impact their mental health, but are understudied in terms of addressing mental health comorbidities to improve hiv prevention and treatment outcomes. mental health comorbidities besides depression have rarely been addressed in hiv research, despite the high prevalence of disorders such as anxiety and post traumatic stress in people at risk for or living with hiv. despite the high prevalence of violence exposures among people at risk for or living with hiv, there are gaps in our knowledge of the mechanisms through which violence impacts the hiv prevention and treatment continua; further, there are few empirically based interventions to address violence that have been shown to improve hiv prevention and treatment outcomes.there is a need to deliver efficacious mental health and violence/trauma-related treatments in scalable and cost-efficient ways. deployment of effective interventions depends upon a number of factors, including routine screening to identify individuals with mental disorders. staffing and systemic changes in busy clinical settings may be needed for effective implementation of mental health interventions. targeted implementation science can help to answer these key questions and produce generalizable knowledge regarding feasible and scalable approaches.areas of research interestareas of programmatic interest include, but are not limited to:it is strongly recommended that applicants review the nimh division of aids research current funding opportunity announcements (available on our website at https://www.nimh.nih.gov/about/organization/dar/aids-related-funding-opportunity-announcements-foas.shtml), and consult with a
