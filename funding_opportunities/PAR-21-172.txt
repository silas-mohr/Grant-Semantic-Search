mentored research scientist development award (k01) is to provide salary and research support for a sustained period of “protected time” (3-5 years) for intensive research career development, under the guidance of an experienced mentor, or sponsor in the biomedical, behavioral or clinical sciences leading to research independence. the expectation is that, through this sustained period of research career development and training, awardees will launch independent research careers and become competitive for new research project grant (e.g., r01) funding.the transition to independent environmental health research (tiehr) career award (k01) is targeted to investigators who are within the first three years of their first independent faculty appointment.candidates must name a mentor who is not the postdoctoral mentor and who has active niehs grant support or a substantial history of niehs funded research grant support. the role of the mentor for the tiehr candidate is to provide appropriate guidance, advice and expertise to broaden the research skills of the candidate and assist in the formation of an advisory committee to the candidate and the candidate's research.research projects and career development activities proposed for this foa are expected to contribute to the mission of the niehs, which is to discover how the environment affects people in order to promote healthier lives.candidates to the tiehr program are expected to be drawn from a variety of scientific backgrounds, including basic, mechanistic, clinical, epidemiological, computational, engineering, and/or health risk communication research. applications submitted to the niehs are characterized by a research focus on exposure-health related responses from environmental agents within the mission interest of the niehs.environmental agents which are considered of primary interest for niehs include: industrial chemicals or manufacturing byproducts, metals, pesticides, herbicides, air pollutants and other inhaled toxicants, particulates or fibers, fungal, and bacterial or biologically derived toxins. niehs also supports research which is aimed at defining health effects of the exposome, or the totality of a person’s environmental exposure, and the study of the health effects of mixtures or co-exposures with agents generally outside of niehs mission responsibility, if the primary goal of the study is on an exposure within the niehs mission interest. applicants are strongly encouraged to contact niehs scientific/research staff prior to submission to determine if their project meets the goals of the tiehr.applications not responsive to this foathe following types of studies are not responsive to this foa. applications proposing such studies will be considered non-responsive and will not be reviewed and will be withdrawn:note: this funding opportunity announcement (foa) is designed specifically for applicants proposing research that does not involve leading an independent clinical trial, a clinical trial feasibility study, or an ancillary study to a clinical trial. applicants to this foa are permitted to propose a research experience in a clinical trial led by a mentor or co-mentor. applicants proposing a clinical trial or an ancillary study to an ongoing clinical trial as lead investigator, should apply to the companion foa (par-21-171). applicants proposing basic science experimental studies involving humans, referred to in not-od-18-212 as “prospective basic science studies involving human participants", should apply to companion foa, par-21-170.nih defines a clinical trial as "a research study in which one or more human subjects are prospectively assigned to one or more interventions (which may include placebo or other control) to evaluate the effects of those interventions on health-related biomedical or behavioral outcomes." (not-od-15-015).nih not only supports trials of safety and efficacy, it also supports mechanistic exploratory studies that meet the definition of a clinical trial and are designed to explore or understand a biological or behavioral process, the pathophysiology of a disease, or the mechanism of action of an intervention. these studies may focus on basic and/or translational discovery research in healthy human subjects and in human subjects who are affected by the pathophysiology of diseases and disorders. by addressing basic questions and concepts in biology, behavior, and pathophysiology, these studies may provide insight into understanding human diseases and disorders along with potential treatments or preventive strategies. nih also supports biomarker studies that meet the definition of a clinical trial and that may provide information about physiological function, target engagement of novel therapeutics, and/or the impact of therapeutics on treatment response. nih thus supports studies that meet the definition of clinical trials (as noted above) but do not seek to establish safety, clinical efficacy, effectiveness, clinical management, and/or implementation of preventive, therapeutic, and services interventions.see section viii. other information for award authorities and regulations.grant: a support mechanism providing money, property, or both to an eligible entity to
