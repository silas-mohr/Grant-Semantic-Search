this funding opportunity announcement should fall within the mission of the institutes/centers. the following nih offices may co-fund applications assigned to those institutes/centers.office of behavioral and social sciences research (obssr)the nih blueprint for neuroscience research (bp) is soliciting administrative supplement applications that support the joint analysis of existing disease-focused and brain research through advancing neurotechnologies (brain) initiative-generated “control” datasets of single-cell/nucleus data from human brain.the nih brain initiative is making major investments in generating single-cell omics data from human brain tissue with the goal of contributing to a reference atlas of cell types in the normal human brain (bican, biccn). these efforts are, and will be, generating large amounts of whole genome data on rna expression, chromatin state, and dna methylation from brain tissue of control subjects (subjects without neurological disorders) at the single-cell and single-nucleus level. in parallel, nih support for single-cell/nucleus omics in the disordered or diseased human brain has been rising exponentially, mainly due to increased support from nih blueprint institutes. the large rise in this type of data presents challenges of storage, curation, and harmonization of datasets, but also provides unique opportunities for leveraging high-quality datasets from brain tissue across the disease spectrum for joint analysis. this includes the use of high-resolution brain initiative-generated reference data as common and widely available control data for use in disease-focused studies, and the inclusion of disease-focused single-cell/nucleus datasets in ongoing efforts mapping “normal” brain cell types.this effort aims support pilot projects that harmonize and jointly analyze datasets from both neurotypical and diseased brains. to this end, the nih bp is soliciting supplement applications that support the integration of disease-focused single-cell/nucleus omics datasets with brain initiative-generated “neurotypical” or “normative” datasets from human brain tissue.eligibilityprojects that are currently funded to analyze single-cell/nucleus datasets from human pre- or post-mortem brain tissue are eligible to apply. projects that do not have an active analysis component are not eligible. this supplement program strongly encourages direct collaborations between investigators funded by the brain initiative and investigators funded by participating nih bp institutes or centers.the supplement will support the inclusion of new datasets into analysis-focused projects that are within scope of the active award. the analysis of single-cell/nucleus data from human brain tissue must be a funded activity of the active award. the supplemental funding is intended to support the ingestion of outside datasets, harmonization of datasets, joint analysis, as well as common storage and broad sharing via an nih supported and designated database (tbd).supplemental funding will not support data generation, analysis of non-human data, analysis of non-brain tissues, or the generation of harmonized datasets that lack a clearly described plan for timely deposition (12 months from start date) for broad sharing.examples of existing resources housing human brain single-cell omics data:review
