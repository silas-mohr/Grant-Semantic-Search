(sgmro)office of research on women's health (orwh)the purpose of this notice is to inform potential applicants of the national institute on drug abuse (nida) special interest in grant applications to conduct rigorous basic, translational and/or clinical research to: (1) advance identification of sex and/or gender differences in risk for substance use disorders or the response or medical consequences of alcohol or substance misuse to uncover the mechanisms of those differences, and to conduct translational research on those differences, and (2) advance research specific to women or highly relevant to women. both preclinical and clinical studies are sought across all areas of drug and alcohol research.commitment to improving research to eliminate health disparities and advance health equitythe national institute on drug abuse and the national institute on alcohol abuse and alcoholism are committed to improving the quality and quantity of drug and alcohol research focused on underrepresented populations. groups shown to suffer health disparities, or differences in incidence, morbidity, and mortality associated with alcohol and other substance misuse,as well as different medical, interpersonal and social consequences, include but are not limited to:specifically, nida and niaaa encourage research that will:backgroundon september 10, 1990, the nih office of research on women’s health was the first public health service office dedicated specifically to women’s health. the office was reaffirmed by statute in congressional legislation by the nih revitalization act of 1993 to serve as the focal point for women’s health research.on june 9, 2015, nih issued not-od-15-102, consideration of sex as a biological variable in nih-funded research requiring that grant applications submitted to the nih must address sex as a biological variable (sabv) in both human and vertebrate animal grant applications. this sabv policy extended nih’s 1994 policy requiring inclusion of women in clinical research to requiring the inclusion of females in preclinical research. further, sabv policy moves beyond inclusion by requiring that sabv must be factored in the design, analysis and reporting of nih clinical and preclinical research and that strong justification must be provided for proposing single sex research.to advance the field beyond changes in policy and practice relevant to the 1993 nih revitalization act and not-od-15-102, there is a need for research that not only includes women and sexual and gender minorities, but examines issues specific to, or highly relevant to these populations, including research that addresses health disparities among women and sexual and genderminorities. there is a similar need for research in which sex is a primary variable and/or that test interactions between biological sex and other biological variables and manipulations designed to model risk factors or manifestations of substance use disorder (sud), including alcohol use disorder (aud).research objectivesa growing body of drug and alcohol research has been reporting outcomes that vary by sex across all domains of research, including basic, translational and clinical, resulting in a growing number of literature reviews. this research has been encouraged by past issuances of women & sex/gender differences in drug abuse and alcohol abuse/dependence funding announcements women & sex/gender differences in alcohol and other substance use disorders (pa-14-038, pa-18-601, pa-18-602, pa-18-603). this notice seeks to build on those past women and sex/gender differences initiatives to advance research considering sex and gender as primary and interacting factors in alcohol and substance use disorder research by encouraging the following research approaches:research that moves beyond sabv policy by seeking applications that have statistical power to detect sex/gender differences in outcomes. the research must be designed from a sex/gender-based perspective and sex/gender hypotheses must be grounded in existing sex/gender-based literature which may be within or outside the fields of drug and alcohol use disorders.premise considerationsas appropriate, research should be premised not only on the drug and alcohol literature base, but also on established knowledge bases of relevant broader scientific fields such as on lifespan development, gender-related sociocultural factors, sexual dimorphisms in the nervous system and other relevant biological systems such as the hpa and hpg axes.analyses of existing data setsunder this notice, investigators may request funds to perform secondary data analyses of either their own data sets or other data sets that are publicly available. for example, nida's clinical trials network data share website (https://datashare.nida.nih.gov/) currently includes hipaa-de-identified raw data from 51 nida funded studies. no approval is needed to download the data.application and submission informationthis notice applies to due dates on or after june 5, 2021 and subsequent receipt dates through september 8, 2024.submit applications for this initiative using one of the following funding opportunity announcements (foas) or any reissues of these announcement through the expiration date of this notice.all instructions in the sf424 (r&r) application
