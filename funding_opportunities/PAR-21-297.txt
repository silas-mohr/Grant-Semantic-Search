technologies (mpt). it supports development of mpts that prevent hiv infection and pregnancy (hormonal and non-hormonal methods) in adolescent and young women. applications for mpt development may involve pharmacokinetic (pk), pharmacodynamic (pd), safety, and drug-drug interactions (ddi) studies. it also encourages biobehavioral and behavioral/social studies to identify mpt end user preferences factors (look, feel, effectiveness, safety and duration of action) and other behavioral/social factors that could promote increased mpt use in adolescent and young women.purpose and backgroundthe objective of this foa is to support development of novel long-acting, systemic and potentially non-systemic multipurpose prevention technologies (mpts) for the purposes of pregnancy and hiv infection prevention in adolescent and young women, as appropriate. of special interest are health disparity populations that are disproportionately infected by hiv and individuals who would desire the convenience of a multi-component prevention strategy.recent advancements in long-acting hiv products allows for the possibility of long-acting combination products. the goal of this initiative is to stimulate research that advances alternative routes of drug delivery systems for multipurpose prevention technologies for use by adolescent girls and young women (agyw), such as injectable, implantable, or transdermal. specifically, this initiative will advance knowledge that would result in innovative delivery systems or approaches so that adolescent girls and young adult women can have effective and reliable options that align with their preferred mode of delivery.specific areas of research interestapplicants are encouraged to consider specifying clinical and nonclinical research milestones and timelines for their proposed research. inclusion of biobehavioral research, integrated into an mpt drug development program, focused on optimizing the rheological and biophysical properties of the product for use by target populations is encouraged. applications may address one or more of the following interest topics.the niaid specific areas of scientific interest for the foa will be:nimh areas of research interestnimh is interested in studies that propose an mpt with an hiv prevention component, and that include a strong behavioral science component

the hhs sbir/sttr program is implementing the phase i to phase ii transition rate benchmark required by the sbir/sttr reauthorization act of 2011 and the sbir and sttr extension act of 2022. the benchmark establishes a minimum number of phase ii awards the company must have received relative to a given number of phase i awards received during the 5-fiscal year time period. the transition rate is calculated as the total number of sbir and sttr phase ii awards a company received during the past 5 fiscal years divided by the total number of sbir and sttr phase i awards it received during the past 5 fiscal years excluding the most recently-completed year. the transition rate requirement, agreed upon and established by all 11 sbir agencies, was published for public comment in a federal register notice on october 16, 2012 (77 fr 63410) and amended on may 23, 2013 (78 fr 30951).on june 1 of each year, sba will identify the companies that fail to meet minimum performance requirements.sba calculates individual company phase i to phase ii transition rates using sbir and sttr award information across all federal agencies. sba will notify companies and the relevant officials at the participating agencies. more information on the phase i to phase ii transition rate requirement is available at sbir.gov.phase ii to commercialization benchmark: in accordance with guidance from the sba, the hhs sbir/sttr programs are implementing the phase ii to commercialization rate benchmark for phase i applicants, as required by the sbir/sttr reauthorization act of 2011 and the sbir and sttr extension act of 2022. the commercialization rate benchmark was published in a federal register notice on august 8, 2013 (78 fr 48537), with a reopening of the comment period published on september 26, 2013 (78 fr 59410).non-domestic (non-u.s.) entities (foreign institutions) are not eligible to apply.non-domestic (non-u.s.) components of u.s. organizations are not eligible to apply.foreign components, as defined in the nih grants policy statement, may be allowed.applicant organizationsapplicant organizations must complete and maintain the following registrations as described in the sf 424 (r&r) application guide to be eligible to apply for or receive an award. all registrations must be completed prior to the application being submitted. registration can take 6 weeks or more, so applicants should begin the registration process as soon as possible. the nih policy on late submission of grant applications states that failure to complete registrations in advance of a due date is not a valid reason for a late submission.program directors/principal investigators (pd(s)/pi(s))all pd(s)/pi(s) must have an era commons account. pd(s)/pi(s) should work with their organizational officials to either create a new account or to affiliate their existing account with the applicant organization in era commons. if the pd/pi is also the organizational signing official, they must have two distinct era commons accounts, one for each role. obtaining an era commons account can take up to 2 weeks.any individual(s) with the skills, knowledge, and resources necessary to carry out the proposed research as the program director(s)/principal investigator(s) (pd(s)/pi(s)) is invited to work with his/her organization to develop an application for support. individuals from underrepresented racial and ethnic groups as well as individuals with disabilities are always encouraged to apply for nih support.under the sbir program, for both phase i and phase ii, the primary employment of the pd/pi must be with the small business concern at the time of award and during the conduct of the proposed project. for projects with multiple pds/pis, at least one must meet the primary employment requirement. occasionally, deviations from this requirement may occur.each pd/pi must commit a minimum of 10% effort to the project.the sf424 (r&r) sbir/sttr application guide should be referenced for specific details on eligibility requirements. for institutions/organizations proposing multiple pds/pis, see multiple principal investigators section of the sf424 (r&r) sbir/sttr application guide.number of applicationsapplicant organizations may submit more than one application, provided that each application is scientifically distinct.nih will not accept similar grant applications with essentially the same research focus from the same applicant organization. this includes derivative or multiple applications that propose to develop a single product, process, or service that, with non-substantive modifications, can be applied to a variety of purposes. applicants may not simultaneously submit identical/essentially identical applications under both this funding opportunity and any other hhs funding opportunity, including the sbir and sttr parent announcements.the nih will not accept duplicate or highly overlapping applications under review at the same time. this means that the nih will not accept:a phase i awardee may submit a phase ii application either before or after expiration of the phase i budget period, unless the awardee elects to submit a phase i and phase ii application concurrently under the fast-track procedure. to maintain eligibility to seek phase ii or iib support, a phase i awardee should submit a phase ii application, and a phase ii awardee should submit a phase iib application, within the first six due dates following the expiration of the phase i or ii budget period, respectively.in phase i, normally, two-thirds or 67% of the research or analytical effort is carried out by the small business concern. the total amount of all consultant and contractual arrangements to third parties for portions of the scientific and technical effort is generally not more than 33% of the total amount requested (direct, f&a/indirect, and fee).in phase ii, normally, one-half or 50% of the research or analytical effort is carried out by the small business concern. the total amount of consultant and contractual arrangements to third parties for portions of the scientific and technical effort is generally not more than 50% of the total phase ii amount requested (direct, f&a/indirect, and fee).we encourage you to contact a program officer listed in section vii with questions about this because occasionally, deviations from these requirements may occur, and must be approved in writing by the funding agreement officer after consultation with the agency sbir program manager/coordinator. the basis for determining the percentage of work to be performed by each of the cooperative parties will be the total of direct, f&a/indirect costs, and fee attributable to each party, unless otherwise described and justified in “consortium/contractual arrangements” of the phs 398 research plan component of the sf424 (r&r) application forms.a small business concern may subcontract a portion of its sbir or sttr award to a federal laboratory within the limits above. a federal laboratory, as defined in 15 u.s.c. § 3703, means any laboratory, any federally funded research and development center, or any center established under 15 u.s.c. §§ 3705 & 3707 that is owned, leased, or otherwise used by a federal agency and funded by the federal government, whether operated by the government or by a contractor.the basis for determining the percentage of work to be performed by each of the cooperative parties in phase i or phase ii will be the total of the requested costs attributable to each party, unless otherwise described and justified in “consortium/contractual arrangements” of the phs 398 research plan component of sf424 (r&r) application forms.additional details are contained in the

applicants planning research (funded or conducted in whole or in part by nih) that results in the generation of scientific data are required to comply with the instructions for the data management and sharing plan. all small business innovation research (sbir) and small business technology transfer (sttr) applicants are required to address a data management and sharing plan, regardless of the amount of direct costs requested for any one year. however, sbir and sttr recipients may retain the rights to data generated during the performance of an sbir or sttr award for up to 20 years after the award date, per the small business innovation research (sbir) and small business technology transfer (sttr) program policy directive. an acceptable data management and sharing plan can reference and incorporate these data rights. further information about sbir and sttr data rights are enumerated in the nih gps.all instructions in the sf424 (r&r) sbir/sttr application guide must be followed.research strategy:the research strategy section must include a timetable for achieving the specific aims with concrete identifiable milestones. these milestones should be described in detail and be feasible within the time-frame of the award period.resource sharing plan: individuals are required to comply with the instructions for the resource sharing plans as provided in the sf424 (r&r) application guide, with the following modification:nichd plans for sharing human and non-human data and/or biospecimensnichd expects that data, biospecimens, and results of nichd-funded research will be shared with the wider scientific community to the extent feasible and in a timely manner. nih data sharing policy expects the timely release and sharing of data to be no later than the acceptance for publication of the main findings from the final dataset. all nichd applications, regardless of the amount of direct costs requested for any one year, are expected to include a sharing plan that addresses sharing of data as well as biospecimens, if applicable. ideally, this plan would include submitting data or biospecimens to an appropriate repository. these plans will also be considered by program staff as award decisions are being made as appropriate and consistent with achieving the goals of the program.specifically, for human data, the nichd encourages the use of the data and specimen hub (dash), a centralized resource for researchers to store and access de-identified data from studies funded by nichd. they can also submit information about the location and availability of biospecimens to dash, if applicable. submission of data to the nichd dash is one way that grantees may meet the requirements of the nih data sharing policy and make study data available for secondary analyses. information about dash may be obtained at https://dash.nichd.nih.gov/.if use of dash is not feasible, nichd expects awardees to share data and/or biospecimens through other equivalent broad-sharing data and/or biospecimen repositories. for projects generating large-scale human genetic data, applicants should provide a provisional or institutional certification specifying whether the individual-level data can be shared through an nih approved repository, such as dbgap, in line with the nih genomic data sharing policy (https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/not-od-14-124.html).appendix:note that phase i sbir/sttr appendix materials are not permitted. only limited items are allowed in the appendix of other
