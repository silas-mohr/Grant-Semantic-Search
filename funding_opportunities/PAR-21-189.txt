clinical trial not allowed)see section iii. 3. additional information on eligibility.93.859the goal of the medical scientist training program (mstp) is to develop a diverse pool of highly trained clinician-scientist leaders available to meet the nation’s biomedical research needs. specifically, this funding opportunity announcement (foa) provides support to eligible domestic institutions to develop and implement effective, evidence-informed approaches to integrated dual-degree training leading to the award of both clinical degrees, e.g., m.d., d.o., d.v.m., d.d.s., pharm.d., and research doctorate degrees (ph.d.). with the dual qualification of rigorous scientific research and clinical practice, graduates will be equipped with the skills to develop research programs that accelerate the translation of research advances to the understanding, detection, treatment and prevention of human disease, and to lead the advancement of biomedical research. areas of particular importance to nigms are the iterative optimization of mstp training efficacy and efficiency, fostering the persistence of mstp alumni in research careers, and enhancing the diversity of the clinician-scientist workforce. nigms expects that the proposed research training programs will incorporate didactic, research, mentoring and career development elements to prepare trainees for careers that will have a significant impact on the health-related research needs of the nation.this funding opportunity announcement (foa) does not allow appointed trainees to lead an independent clinical trial but does allow them to obtain research experience in a clinical trial led by a mentor or co-mentor.march 15, 2021april 25, 2021not applicablestandard dates apply.all applications are due by 5:00 pm local time of

section iii. eligibility information section iv. application and submission information section v. application review information section vi. award administration information section vii. agency contacts section viii. other informationthe overall goal of the nih ruth l. kirschstein national research service award (nrsa) program is to help ensure that a diverse pool of highly trained scientists is available in appropriate scientific disciplines to address the nation's biomedical, behavioral, and clinical research needs. in order to accomplish this goal, nrsa training programs are designed to train individuals to conduct research and to prepare for research careers. more information about nrsa programs may be found at the ruth l. kirschstein national research service award (nrsa) website.the nrsa program has been the primary means of supporting predoctoral and postdoctoral research training programs since enactment of the nrsa legislation in 1974. each program should provide high-quality research training, mentored research experiences, and additional training opportunities that equip trainees with the technical (e.g., appropriate methods, technologies, and quantitative/computational approaches), operational (e.g., independent knowledge acquisition, rigorous experimental design and interpretation of data, conducting research in the safest manner possible) and professional (e.g., management, leadership, communication, and teamwork) skills required for careers in the biomedical research workforce.through this funding announcement, nigms encourages changes in integrated medical and graduate research training to keep pace with the rapid evolution of the biomedical research enterprise that is increasingly complex, interdisciplinary, quantitative, and collaborative. other changes in the biomedical research enterprise include greater diversity in the backgrounds of people participating in biomedical research, the approaches utilized to investigate clinically relevant research questions, and the range of the careers that dual-degree recipients are pursuing. additionally, there is an increasing recognition of the need to enhance reproducibility of biomedical research results through scientific rigor and transparency, and to promote a culture where the highest standards of practice are used to ensure the safety of all individuals in the research environment. this foa is intended to encourage and enable the scientific community to develop and implement evidence-informed approaches to biomedical research training and mentoring that will effectively train future generations of rigorous biomedical clinician scientists to become leaders in biomedical research and clinical medicine.each funded program should provide high-quality clinical training and mentored research experiences, and additional opportunities that equip trainees with the technical, operational, and professional skills required for careers as clinician-scientists in the biomedical research workforce. the intention is not to layer additional activities onto existing structures; instead, this foa is designed to allow for creative and transformational approaches to biomedical graduate training, including curricular reform, that preserve the best elements of current programs, while enhancing the focus on the development of trainee skills. nigms encourages continuous experimentation that tests and evaluates new approaches to dual-degree training (ph.d. combined with clinical degrees, e.g., m.d., d.o., d.v.m., d.d.s., pharm.d.), and then disseminates the results of those experiments to the community.the overarching objective of this medical scientist training program is to develop a diverse pool of well-trained clinician scientists, who have the following technical, operational, and professional skills:diversity at all levels—from the kinds of science to the regions in which it is conducted to the backgrounds of the people conducting it— contributes to excellence in research training environments and strengthens the research enterprise. this foa is intended to support outstanding research training programs that will enhance diversity at all levels (e.g., see nih's interest in diversity).under this foa, niaid will support the medical school portion of training for students enrolled in an nih graduate partnership program, which is designed to bring ph.d. graduate students to the nih intramural research program for dissertation research. these students must be accepted by an nigms-funded medical scientist training program (mstp t32).nigms will accept predoctoral training grant applications supporting integrated medical and graduate research training through this mstp foa and subsequent reissuances (graduate research training in basic biomedical sciences is supported through par-20-213 and subsequent reissuances). applicants are strongly encouraged to read information about nigms institutional predoctoral training grants and the mstp found on the nigms website and to contact program staff before submitting an application. nigms will not accept applications for predoctoral training submitted through the parent t32 foa, pa-20-142 and subsequent reissuances.programs are expected to develop institutional training programs that integrate clinical and research training and expose trainees to a diversity of scientific approaches, systems for study, research methods, and technologies. funded programs should implement plans to optimize the time required to earn the dual degree. programs are expected to limit appointments to individuals committed to research careers that utilize the dual-degree qualifications.nigms encourages programs to devise and test alternative entry pathways in addition to or instead of the direct application and admission to the first year of a dual-degree training program, thus providing opportunities to recruit students from clinician-only or from ph.d.-only programs. nigms encourages institutions to offer mstp trainees the opportunity to earn the ph.d. in a broad range of biomedical, physical, social and behavioral sciences, and engineering to meet the needs for clinician-scientist researchers in all areas of the biomedical workforce. programs that provide interdisciplinary research training, incorporate training in data science, or take advantage of clinical research opportunities within nationwide networks and infrastructures such as the nih clinical and translational science award program are encouraged to apply. nigms encourages applicants to offer training across the landscape of medical fields and scientific disciplines related to health, and to provide opportunities for the exploration of clinician-scientist career options.applicants are expected to identify training needs and objectives (i.e., specific and measurable outcomes the program intends to achieve) and develop plans to implement evidence-informed training and mentoring activities (i.e., approaches that are grounded in the literature and from evaluations of existing relevant training programs). funded training programs must ensure that trainees have a solid foundation in methods to enhance data reproducibility through rigor and transparency. applicants are encouraged to consult the nigms clearinghouse for training modules to enhance data reproducibility, and other resources when developing the plans.funded programs are expected to implement robust plans to enhance diversity and to promote inclusive, safe, and supportive research environments. specifically, funded programs should have institutional and departmental environments where individuals from all backgrounds are welcomed and feel integrated into and supported by the biomedical community. programs are also expected to implement plans to enhance trainee retention, i.e., to sustain the scientific interests and participation of trainees from all backgrounds. additionally, safety in research training should encompass (1) environments free from harassment and intimidation, in which everyone participating is treated in a respectful and supportive manner, (2) laboratory and clinical settings where individuals exercise the highest standards of practice for chemical, biological and physical safety, and (3) practices at the institutional leadership and research community levels that demonstrate core values and behaviors to emphasize safety over competing goals.funded programs are expected to provide evidence of accomplishing the training objectives in progress reports and when applying for renewal, to make training and career outcomes publicly available, and are strongly encouraged to disseminate successful training practices to the broader training community.institutional commitment and support for the proposed training program are important elements of the application. the research training program may complement and synergize with other ongoing federally-supported predoctoral research training programs at the applicant institution (e.g., in the development of skills needed for careers in the biomedical research workforce that are not discipline-specific); however, the scientific training goals must be distinct from related programs at the same institution currently receiving federal support. in cases where an institution has multiple nigms predoctoral training grants, it is expected that these programs will seek to create administrative and training efficiencies to reduce costs and improve trainee services and outcomes. the training grant should be well integrated within one or more graduate department(s)/program(s) and should exert a strong, positive influence on the development and execution of the outreach and recruitment of potential trainees, graduate curriculum, training opportunities and mentoring. training grant funds may not be used solely as a vehicle to provide stipends for trainees to conduct research.nigms does not accept applications for predoctoral t32 programs proposing only short-term research training. programs proposing short-term research training should apply to the kirschstein-nrsa short-term institutional research training grant program (t35) exclusively reserved for predoctoral, short-term research training (see pa-20-162 and subsequent reissuances). nigms will not accept applications proposing combined predoctoral and postdoctoral training under this foa.training grants are usually awarded for five years. the grant offsets the cost of stipends, tuition and fees, and training-related expenses, including health insurance, for the appointed trainees in accordance with the approved nih support levels. nigms typically provides full-time support for approximately 25% of the trainees in the training program during any given year. individuals may receive up to six years of aggregate kirschstein-nrsa support at the predoctoral level for dual-degree training, including any combination of support from institutional training grants (e.g., t32) and an individual fellowship award. nigms encourages training grant support to be concentrated earlier in graduate school for students to receive maximum benefit from training grant activities, but there may be situations in which other modes of training support are acceptable. many dual-degree training programs guarantee enrolled students full support throughout the training period (through combinations of mstp support, institutional funds, other fellowships, and grants). training programs may implement institutional policies regarding the payback of non-nrsa institutional sources of funds by students who start training but do not complete one or both degrees. nigms does not require (nor permit institutions to receive) payback of nrsa funds from trainees who are appointed to nih training grants, but do not complete training.for applicants that currently have an nigms institutional predoctoral mstp, nigms recommends that applicants plan to apply under this foa at least one- to one-and-a-half years before the current grant is scheduled to terminate. for example, if the current grant is scheduled to terminate on june 30, 2023, applicants are advised to submit an application to this foa no later than may 25, 2022. please consult the nigms website for more information on predoctoral training grant application deadlines.this foa does not allow appointed trainees to lead an independent clinical trial but does allow them to obtain research experience in a clinical trial led by a mentor or co-mentor. nih strongly supports training towards a career in clinically relevant research and so gaining experience in clinical trials under the guidance of a mentor or co-mentor is encouraged.see section viii. other information for award authorities and regulations.grant: a support mechanism providing money, property, or both to an eligible entity to carry out an approved project or activity.new renewal of awards submitted to par-19-036 resubmissionthe oer glossary and the sf424 (r&r) application guide provide details on these application types. only those application types listed here are allowed for this foa.not allowed: only accepting applications that do not propose clinical trialsnote: appointed trainees are permitted

and the submission of a sufficient number of meritorious applications.application budgets are not limited but need to reflect the actual needs of the proposed project.grantees are expected to be familiar with and comply with applicable cost policies and the nrsa guidelines (nih grants policy statement - institutional research training grants). funds may be used only for those expenses that are directly related to and necessary for the research training and must be expended in conformance with omb cost principles, the nih grants policy statement, and the nrsa regulations, policies, guidelines, and conditions set forth in this document.awards may be for project periods up to five years in duration and are renewable.kirschstein-nrsa awards provide stipends as a subsistence allowance to help defray living expenses during the research training experience. nih will contribute to the combined cost of tuition and fees at the rate in place at the time of award. stipend levels, as well as funding amounts for tuition and fees and the institutional allowance are announced annually in the nih guide for grants and contracts, and are also posted on the ruth l. kirschstein national research service award (nrsa) webpage.nigms will provide up to $300 per trainee to travel to scientific meetings or training experiences that will enhance their development. plans for trainee travel should be well justified.nih will provide funds to help defray other research training expenses, such as health insurance, staff salaries, consultant costs, equipment, research supplies, and faculty/staff travel directly related to the research training program. the most recent levels of training related expenses are announced annually in the nih guide for grants and contracts, and are also posted on the ruth l. kirschstein national research service award (nrsa) webpage.indirect costs (also known as facilities & administrative [f&a] costs) are reimbursed at 8% of modified total direct costs (exclusive of tuition and fees, consortium costs in excess of $25,000, and expenditures for equipment), rather than on the basis of a negotiated rate agreement.nih grants policies as described in the nih grants policy statement will apply to the applications submitted and awards made from this foa.higher education institutionsthe following types of higher education institutions are always encouraged to apply for nih support as public or private institutions of higher education:nonprofits other than institutions of higher educationgovernmentsothernigms encourages multiple institutions to participate in a single mstp application, where this may further advance the goals of the program. a single contact institution would receive and administer the award.the sponsoring institution must assure support for the proposed program. appropriate institutional commitment to the program should be detailed in the institutional support letter in the letters of support attachment. see the application instructions for the required “letters of support” instructions in section iv.non-domestic (non-u.s.) entities (foreign institutions) are not eligible to apply.non-domestic (non-u.s.) components of u.s. organizations are not eligible to apply.applicant organizationsapplicant organizations must complete and maintain the following registrations as described in the sf 424 (r&r) application guide to be eligible to apply for or receive an award. all registrations must be completed prior to the application being submitted. registration can take 6 weeks or more, so applicants should begin the registration process as soon as possible. the nih policy on late submission of grant applications states that failure to complete registrations in advance of a due date is not a valid reason for a late submission.program directors/principal investigators (pd(s)/pi(s))all pd(s)/pi(s) must have an era commons account. pd(s)/pi(s) should work with their organizational officials to either create a new account or to affiliate their existing account with the applicant organization in era commons. if the pd/pi is also the organizational signing official, they must have two distinct era commons accounts, one for each role. obtaining an era commons account can take up to 2 weeks.any individual(s) with the skills, knowledge, and resources necessary to carry out the proposed research training program as the training program director/principal investigator (training pd/pi) is invited to work with his/her organization to develop an application for support. individuals from underrepresented racial and ethnic groups as well as individuals with disabilities are always encouraged to apply for nih support. for institutions/organizations proposing multiple pds/pis, visit the multiple program director/principal investigator policy and submission details in the senior/key person profile (expanded) component of the sf 424 (r&r) application guide.as described in the instructions for the training program director(s)/principal investigator(s) (pd(s)/pi(s)) in section iv.2 below, nigms encourages multiple pds/pis, particularly when each brings a unique perspective and skill set that will enhance training. at least one of the training pds/pis should be an established investigator in the biomedical sciences and capable of providing both administrative and scientific leadership to the development and implementation of the proposed program. additional pd(s)/pi(s), including individuals with experience in the science of education, relevant social science disciplines, program evaluation, mentoring, and university administration may be included to achieve the training goals. any of the pds/pis may serve as the contact pd/pi. the contact pd/pi is expected to have a full-time appointment at the applicant institution unless extremely well-justified. if the full-time status of the contact pd/pi changes after the award, the institution must obtain prior program approval to appoint a new pd/pi or request a deviation from the full-time rule. the pds/pis will be responsible for the selection and appointment of trainees to the approved research training program, and for the overall direction, management, administration, and evaluation of the program. the pds/pis will be expected to monitor and assess the program and submit all documents and reports as required. the pds/pis have responsibility for the day-to-day administration of the program and are responsible for appointing members of the advisory committee (when applicable) and using their recommendations to determine the appropriate allotment of funds.this foa does not require cost sharing as defined in the nih grants policy statement.nigms will accept only one application per institution, typically defined by a unique entity identifier, such as duns and an nih institution profile file (ipf) number. the nih will not accept duplicate or highly overlapping applications under review at the same time. this means that the nih will not accept:the selected faculty should be active researchers in the biomedical sciences as demonstrated by recent publications and research support. when building a training team, programs should include faculty who are committed to training, mentoring, and providing supportive and inclusive research environments. programs are encouraged to build a diverse team of preceptors/mentors that includes, for example, faculty from underrepresented groups (see notice of nih's interest in diversity) and faculty at different career stages (i.e., early-career as well as established faculty).the individual to be trained must be a citizen or a noncitizen national of the united states or have been lawfully admitted for permanent residence at the time of appointment. additional details on citizenship, training period, and aggregate duration of support are available in the nih grants policy statement.all trainees are required to pursue their research training full time, normally defined as 40 hours per week, or as specified by the sponsoring institution in accordance with its own policies. appointments are normally made in 12-month increments, and no trainee may be appointed for less than 9 months during the initial period of appointment, except with prior approval of the awarding unit.mstp predoctoral trainees must be enrolled in a program leading to a combined health professional degree and a ph.d.

section iii.1 for information regarding the requirement for obtaining a unique entity identifier and for completing and maintaining active registrations in system for award management (sam), nato commercial and government entity (ncage) code (if applicable), era commons, and grants.govpart i. overview information contains information about key dates and times. applicants are encouraged to submit applications before the due date to ensure they have time to make any application corrections that might be necessary for successful submission. when a submission date falls on a weekend or federal holiday, the application deadline is automatically extended to the next business day. organizations must submit applications to grants.gov (the online portal to find and apply for grants across all federal agencies). applicants must then complete the submission process by tracking the status of the application in the era commons, nih’s electronic system for grants administration. nih and grants.gov systems check the application against many of the application instructions upon submission. errors must be corrected and a changed/corrected application must be submitted to grants.gov on or before the application due date and time. if a changed/corrected application is submitted after the deadline, the application will be considered late. applications that miss the due date and time are subjected to the nih policy on late application submission. applicants are responsible for viewing their application before the due date in the era commons to ensure accurate and successful submission. information on the submission process and a definition of on-time submission are provided in the sf424 (r&r) application guide.this initiative is not subject to intergovernmental review.all nih awards are subject to the terms and conditions, cost principles, and other considerations described in the nih grants policy statement. the national research service award (nrsa) policies apply to this program. an nrsa appointment may not be held concurrently with another federally sponsored fellowship, traineeship, or similar federal award that provides a stipend or otherwise duplicates provisions of the nrsa. pre-award costs are allowable only as described in the nih grants policy statement. note, however, that pre-award costs are not allowable charges for stipends or tuition/fees on institutional training grants because these costs may not be charged to the grant until a trainee has actually been appointed and the appropriate paperwork submitted to the nih awarding component. any additional costs associated with the decision to allow research elective credit for short-term research training are not allowable charges on an institutional training grant.nigms does not permit automatic carryover of training grant funds from one budget period to the next.applications must be submitted electronically following the instructions described in the

outcomes for trainees (renewals) or training grant eligible pool (new applications)program evaluationas applicable for the project proposed, reviewers will evaluate the following additional items while determining scientific and technical merit, and in providing an overall impact score, but will not give separate scores for these items.training in methods for enhancing reproducibilitydoes the instruction in methods for enhancing reproducibility plan describe how trainees will be instructed in principles important for enhancing research reproducibility including, at a minimum, evaluation of foundational research underlying a project, rigorous experimental design and data analysis, consideration of relevant biological variables such as sex, authentication of key biological and/or chemical resources, data and material sharing, record keeping, and transparency in reporting? are the rigor and transparency components sufficiently well integrated into the overall curriculum? are they taught at multiple stages of trainee development and in a variety of formats and contexts? does the teaching synergize with elements of the curriculum designed to enhance trainees' abilities to conduct responsible research? is there evidence that all participating faculty reiterate and augment key elements of methods for enhancing reproducibility when trainees are performing mentored research their laboratories? the plan will be rated as acceptable or unacceptable, and the summary statement will provide the consensus of the review committee.recruitment plan to enhance diversityreviewers will examine the strategies to be used in the recruitment of prospective individuals from underrepresented groups. the plan will be rated as acceptable or unacceptable, and the consensus of the review committee will be included in an administrative note in the summary statement.training in the responsible conduct of researchall applications for support under this foa must include a plan to fulfill nih requirements for instruction in the responsible conduct of research (rcr). taking into account the specific characteristics of the training program, the level of trainee experience, and the particular circumstances of the trainees, the reviewers will evaluate the adequacy of the proposed rcr training in relation to the following five required components: 1) format - does the plan satisfactorily address the format of instruction, e.g. lectures, coursework and/or real-time discussion groups, including face-to-face interaction? (a plan involving only on-line instruction is not acceptable); 2) subject matter – does the plan include a sufficiently broad selection of subject matter, such as conflict of interest, authorship, data management, human subjects and animal use, laboratory safety, research misconduct, and research ethics? 3) faculty participation - does the plan adequately describe how faculty will participate in the instruction? for renewal applications, are all training faculty who served as course directors, speakers, lecturers, and/or discussion leaders during the past project period named in the application? 4) duration of instruction - does the plan meet the minimum requirements for rcr, i.e., at least eight contact hours of instruction? 5) frequency of instruction – does the plan meet the minimum requirements for rcr, i.e., at least once during each career stage (undergraduate, post-baccalaureate, predoctoral, postdoctoral, and faculty levels) and at a frequency of no less than once every four years?are the rcr components sufficiently well integrated into the overall curriculum? are they taught at multiple stages of trainee development and in a variety of formats and contexts? does the teaching of rcr synergize with elements of the curriculum designed to enhance trainees' abilities to conduct rigorous and reproducible research? is there evidence that all participating faculty reiterate and augment key elements of responsible conduct when trainees are performing mentored research their laboratories?plans and past record will be rated as acceptable or unacceptable,
