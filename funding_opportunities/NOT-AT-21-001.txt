innovation research grant applications (parent sbir [r43/r44] clinical trial required)national center for complementary and integrative health (nccih)the national center for complementary and integrative health (nccih) is committed to the rigorous investigation of mind and body interventions (mbis) to determine their usefulness and safety. through this notice of special interest (nosi), nccih supports cutting-edge small business innovation research (sbir) and small business technology transfer (sttr) grant applications from small business concerns that will develop and/or validate devices or electronic systems that can: 1) monitor biologically or behaviorally based processes applicable to mbis or 2) be used in optimizing the practice or increasing the efficacy of mbis. the applications should: 1) lead to the development of new technologies, 2) adapt existing innovative technologies, devices, and/or electronic systems, 3) repurpose existing devices and electronic systems, or 4) conduct testing of single or combined components of an integrated, long-term, automated, wearable stimulation device or electronic system to monitor or enhance the mechanistic processes or functional outcomes of mbis. for the purposes of this nosi, mbis are nonpharmacologic approaches that include mind/brain focused interventions (e.g., meditation, mindfulness, hypnosis, art/music) or combined mind and body treatment (e.g., acupuncture, massage, spinal manipulation/mobilization) or meditative movement practices (e.g., yoga, tai chi, qi gong).backgroundstudies of mbis typically comprise three key elements. the first key element is the intervention itself, which commonly involves complex procedures or techniques administered by a trained practitioner, taught by a teacher, or self-taught or administered to improve function and/or to modulate or reduce symptoms (to learn more about mbis, please see https://www.nccih.nih.gov/health/complementary-alternative-or-integrative-health-whats-in-a-name.). the second key element is the underlying biological or behavioral process by which a given mbi may exert its intended functional change or clinical outcome. the mechanism(s) or process(es) may range widely from biochemical/molecular processes to behavior change. commonly studied mechanisms of action for mbis include structural and/or functional changes of physiological systems and networks including parasympathetic and sympathetic neural systems, cortical and subcortical neural networks, neuromuscular systems, the vascular and lymphatic systems, or anti-inflammatory processes. the third key element is the intended functional or clinical outcome for the intervention. currently, nccih-supported extramural mbi research focuses on behavior change and clinical outcomes related to the following high program priority areas:the ultimate goal of many studies of mbis is to optimize their methods of delivery to maximize efficacy. such a goal may be accomplished through technological innovation to monitor and possibly facilitate relevant underlying processes associated with these interventions.specific areas of research interestexamples of research topics of interest under this nosi relevant to a given mbi may include, but are not limited to:scopethis nosi primarily supports research on various types of mbis. for the purposes of this nosi, mbis are nonpharmacologic approaches that include mind/brain focused interventions (e.g., meditation, mindfulness, hypnosis, art/music) or combined mind and body treatments (e.g., acupuncture, massage, spinal manipulation/mobilization) or meditative movement practices (e.g., yoga, tai chi, qi gong).proposed technologies, devices, or electronic systems are expected to target proven or putative mechanisms of an mbi, adherence to mbi practices, or quality of trainer-trainee interactions or other aspects of the approach to either monitor or enhance its effect. a goal of the research should be the commercialization of technology for use by researchers, clinicians, or consumers. development or adaptation of innovative noninvasive technologies or minimally invasive technologies is preferred.devices and technologies developed with the support of this nosi may be targeted for use across the lifespan (children, adolescents, adults, and elderly), to special populations (e.g., pregnant women, individuals with disabilities), and for a range of social contexts (individuals, family, exercise groups, classroom).preclinical testing studies of the proposed technology, device, or electronic system may concentrate on healthy animals or relevant animal models for clinical outcomes of high program priority to nccih as described in the section above.pilot clinical testing of the proposed technology, device, or electronic system should test its effects on presumed mechanisms or processes as the primary outcomes, and may target healthy populations or a clinical population of high program priority for nccih (please see the listing of nccih high program priority clinical outcomes in the section above). nccih will not support clinical trials aiming to test efficacy/effectiveness (meaning the study is powered on a primary outcome that is a clinical assessment, such as pain, depression, or anxiety) of an intervention as a part of an sbir phase i or sttr application.additional information for fda-regulated devicesif a device is proposed as part of pilot clinical testing, investigators must contact the u.s. food and drug administration (fda) prior to submitting an application to determine if an investigational device exemption (ide) application is necessary for the proposed clinical research.application and submission informationthis notice applies to due dates on or after january 05, 2021 and subsequent receipt dates through january 05, 2024.submit applications for this
