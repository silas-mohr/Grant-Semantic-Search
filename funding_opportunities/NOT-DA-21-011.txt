in individuals with diabetes mellitus, hypertension or obesity; in individuals with chronic diseases of organs and systems rich in ace-2 receptors; and in sud and hiv populations.research objectives: nida is interested in receiving research applications focusing on individuals who smoke or vape either marijuana and/or tobacco to determine: 1) the risk of contracting a covid-19 infection, 2) the effects on asymptomatic covid-19 infected persons, and 3) the course of the covid-19 infection.this nosi encourages research to understand:application and submission informationthis notice applies to due dates on or after june 5, 2021 and subsequent receipt dates through september 7, 2024.submit applications for this initiative using one of the following funding opportunity announcements (foas) or any reissues of these announcement through the expiration date of this notice.pa-20-184 - research project grant (parent r01 basic experimental studies with humans required)pa-20-183 - research project grant (parent r01 clinical trial required)pa-20-200 - nih small research grant program (parent r03 clinical trial not allowed)pa-20-195 - nih exploratory/developmental research grant (parent r21 clinical trial not allowed)pa-20-194 - nih exploratory/developmental research grant program (parent r21 clinical trial required)pa-20-196 - nih exploratory/developmental research grant program (parent r21 basic experimental studies with humans required)pa-20-146 - nida small research grant program (r03 clinical trial required)all instructions in the sf424 (r&r) application guide and the funding opportunity announcement used for submission must be followed, with the following additions:applications nonresponsive to terms of this nosi will not be considered for the nosi initiative.scientific/research contact(s)raul mandler, md;
