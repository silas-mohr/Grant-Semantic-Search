february 26, 2021pa-20-185 - nih research project grant (parent r01 clinical trial not allowed)par-19-368 - accelerating the pace of drug abuse research using existing data (r01 clinical trial optional)pa-20-183 - research project grant (parent r01 clinical trial required)national institute on drug abuse (nida)the purpose of this notice is to encourage grant applications proposing research that makes use of available, large data sets with the objective of improving hiv epidemic modeling and service planning, with greater attention to the role of substance use. data may be from nida-funded or co-funded projects as well as from other sources. this notice is expected to increase the utilization of existing data including epidemiologic and clinic cohorts, longitudinal follow-up studies of interventions, as well as other publicly available data including those provided by government bodies, data warehouses and commercial data sources. existing data may include data from completed projects as well as those that are ongoing.results from studies supported by this nosi are expected to generate knowledge that can be used to answer significant questions about hiv epidemics, promote efficient provision of services, and address limitations of existing models that have guided public policy. nida is particularly interested in research that integrates substance use considerations into program planning and policy to increase the quality of hiv services and their responsiveness to substance using populations.backgroundthe past limitations of hiv surveillance systems led to generation of a large, often influential literature that has modeled epidemic projections including the potential impacts of novel approaches to hiv prevention and care. this literature usually has neglected the impact of substance use even though epidemiologic research has indicated the importance of substance use as an attributable risk for hiv acquisition. cross-validation of models rarely occurs although the small number of such studies have raised important questions about influential prior work, including that among substance use-related hiv epidemics. there also has been inattention to variations in epidemics within the us and other countries and how substance use may have influenced these variations, as well as change in epidemics over time.population-based data have evolved dramatically over the past two decades, including data that are useful for modeling hiv and substance use epidemiology and related services. hiv planning processes for ryan white and centers for disease control and prevention (cdc) prevention funds no longer rely primarily on aids cases or testing data; hiv diagnoses are now routinely tracked longitudinally by public health authorities. data warehouses such as those fostered by health departments and non-profit funders such as the urban institute at the regional and state level often enable aggregation of demographics, vital statistics and public health data that can help explain substance use and hiv outcomes. insurance claims data have become more available to academic researchers along with electronic health records and commercially available prescribing data. new cohorts such as nidaâ€™s c3pno collaborative, the expansion of the centers for aids research (cfar) network of integrated clinical systems (cnics) collaborative within the (cfar) and aggregations of existing cohorts such as the north american aids cohort collaboration on research and design (na-accord) and the international epidemiology databases to evaluate aids (iedea) all provide opportunities to better understand hiv epidemiology and its clinical course. nida and other nih institutes support data archives such as the national addiction & hiv data archive program (nahdap) which include public use datasets from observational and clinical trial research.the expansion of data sources has been paralleled by the development of new longitudinal data analysis techniques as well as new approaches to geographic analysis of data. this nosi seeks to further methodologic advances and support the development and testing of new statistical methods to carryout modeling of epidemics and service provision. substance use should be integrated into study aims and hypotheses in ways that reflect its roles in hiv risk and the ways it may impede consistent participation in prevention and care.the full range of substance use will be considered including problematic, episodic use and substance use disorders, as well as a complete range of relevant substances (including alcohol and tobacco) and modes of substance administration, including injection and non-injection use. substance use may affect transmission directly as in the case of injection or may affect hiv acquisition/transmission through sexual risk behavior or treatment adherence. applications should provide an epidemiologic justification for the substance use scope that is addressed. domestic and overseas intervention studies will be considered with particular attention to populations who have disproportionate burden of hiv infection.research objectivesnida is interested in applications that make use of existing data, such as epidemiologic cohorts, clinic cohorts and longitudinal follow-up studies of interventions, as well as other publicly available sources of data including data warehouses and commercial data sources. substance use should be a key component of any research supported by this nosi.this nosi encourages, but is not limited to, research applications in the following areas:application and submission informationthis notice applies to due dates on or after may 7, 2021 and subsequent receipt dates through september 7, 2024.submit applications for this initiative using one of the following funding opportunity announcements (foas) or any reissues of these announcement through the expiration date of this notice.all instructions in the sf424 (r&r) application guide and the funding opportunity announcement used for submission must be followed, with the following additions:applications nonresponsive to terms of this nosi will not be considered for the nosi initiative.scientific/research contact(s)richard a. jenkins phd national institute on drug abuse/division of epidemiology, services and prevention research telephone:301-443-1923 email: jenkinsri@mail.nih.govweekly toc for this announcement nih funding opportunities and noticesnote: for help accessing pdf, rtf, ms word, excel, powerpoint, audio or video files, see help downloading files.
