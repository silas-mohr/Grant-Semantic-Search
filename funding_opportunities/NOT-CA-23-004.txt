how well the assays predict the development of clinical cancer among asymptomatic individuals (prediagnostic performance study); and how well the assay preforms in a clinical utility cancer screening trial. while several liquid biopsy technologies have been examined for distinguishing individuals with cancer, fewer studies have examined the prediagnostic performance in asymptomatic individuals who may be targets for cancer screening and can benefit the most from clinical interventions. the most efficient way to accomplish these studies is to use stored samples that are collected prior to cancer diagnosis. to advance this field, partnerships need to be encouraged between technology developers and population-based researchers (including cohort and biorepository researchers), to facilitate these biomarker investigations in the appropriate populations with the optimal study design.research objectivesthrough this nosi, nci encourages applications that investigate the use of existing cohort samples and samples from ongoing prospective collections for analytical and clinical validation of assays for earlier detection of cancer.research areas of interest for this nosi include but are not limited to:nci has a history of supporting cohorts and biorepositories that can be identified through the dcp biorepositories, dccps funded cohorts, the nci cohort consortium, the early detection research network, and a searchable list of cohorts through the nci cancer epidemiology descriptive cohort database (cedcd). other catalogues that list potential cohorts or biorepository researchers include the nci specimen resource locator (srl) or nhlbi biologic specimen and data repositories information coordinating center (biolincc).applications not responsive to this foathe following types of studies are not responsive to this foa. applications proposing such studies will be considered non-responsive and will not be reviewed.application and submission informationthis notice applies to due dates on or after january 5, 2023, and subsequent receipt dates through july 02, 2025.submit applications for this initiative using one of the following funding opportunity announcements (foas) or any reissues of these announcements through the expiration date of this noticeactivity codefoa titlefirst available due dateexpiration datepar-20-313assay validation of high quality markers for clinical studies in cancer (uh2/uh3 clinical trial not allowed)february 14, 2023october 11, 2023par-20-314assay validation of high quality markers for clinical studies in cancer (uh3 clinical trials not allowed)february 14, 2023october 11, 2023pa-22-176phs 2021-2 omnibus solicitation of the nih, cdc and fda for small business innovation research grant applications (parent sbir [r43/r44] clinical trial not allowed)january 05, 2023april 06, 2023pa-22-178omnibus solicitation of the nih for small business technology transfer grant applications (parent sttr [r41/r42] clinical trial not allowed)january 05, 2023april 06, 2023par-21-330utilizing the plco biospecimens resource to bridge gaps in cancer etiology and early detection research (u01 clinical trial not allowed)february 10, 2023october 12, 2024pa-20-185nih research project grant (parent r01 clinical trial not allowed)february 05, 2023may 08, 2023par-22-216nci clinical and translational exploratory/developmental studies (r21 clinical trial optional)february 05, 2023july 02, 2025all instructions in the sf424 (r&r) application guide and the funding opportunity announcement used for submission must be followed, with the following additions:applications nonresponsive to terms of this nosi will not be considered for the nosi initiative.scientific/research contact(s)matthew young, ph.d. national cancer institute (nci) telephone: 240-276-5846 email: matthew.young@nih.govleah e. mechanic, ph.d., m.p.h. national cancer institute (nci) telephone: 240-276-6847 email: mechanil@mail.nih.govxing-jian lou, ph.d.
