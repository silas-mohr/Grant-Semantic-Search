epigenetic status) and cell-extrinsic factors (inflammatory state; microbiome), ranging from increased notch signaling and immunosuppression to mtor and inflammasome inhibition. moreover, current general dietary guidelines were developed from population-based data and do not capture the effects of interpersonal variation in nutrient metabolism or diet-related cancer risk. for example, animal-based high-fat diets significantly increase the levels of deoxycholic acid (dca), a secondary bile acid produced by microbial dehydroxylation of bile that has been shown to promote liver cancer in mouse models, but it is unknown how nutrition affects production of dca. given the complex relationship between diet and metabolic states, and the multiple levels at which metabolism operates, further research is needed to understand how diet affects cell and tissue nutrient- sensing associated signaling pathways that are critical to tumor initiation and progression.several classes of nutrient sensors have been identified that detect intracellular and extracellular levels of diet-derived macronutrients (carbohydrate, protein, lipids) and micronutrients (xenobiotics, vitamins, amino acids, and sugars). these sensors regulate signaling pathways critical to cell fate decisions in developing tumors. some of these nutrient sensors are well known and characterized (e.g., vitamin d receptor), while others are much less well studied, (e.g., rage, pi3k, mondo factors, g-protein coupled receptors, sterol and carbohydrate-responsive element-binding proteins (srebp and chrebp), and others). studies investigating how these nutrient sensors affect tumorigenesis may identify novel molecular targets for cancer- preventive nutritional strategies.research objectivesthis purpose of this nosi is to stimulate investigations of nutrient sensor signaling mechanisms that promote or inhibit carcinogenesis (affecting either cancer etiology or prevention).development of nutritional strategies that could modulate cancer-relevant nutrient-sensing pathways will require a better understanding of; i) the interpersonal variation in nutrient metabolism and individualâ€™s metabolic response to changes in diet/dietary patterns, ii) the cell and molecular factors that control host responses to a given dietary regimen and how these mechanisms may vary between tissues, iii) the identification of dietary components (or their metabolites) and their signaling pathways that affect gene regulation, cellular processes and cell fate decisions important for cancer etiology, prevention, and progression, and iv) how these components interact at the cellular, tissue, and systems levels.examples of responsive proposals include:1. determine how diet affects cell nutrient-sensing signal pathways during early tumor formation (from pre-malignant to early lesions), including specific nutrient effects on signaling pathways in stromal and microbial cells that may support or suppress tumor formation or progression via production/inhibition of oncometabolites or inflammatory factors.2. examine how nutrient sensing regulates and maintains metabolic homeostasis in early lesions during tumor development.3. determine how diet regulates nutrient-sensing signals that affect host genetic, epigenetic, metagenomic, metabolic, and stem cell changes, that support or suppress tumor formation and/or progression.4. identify critical nutrient-sensor signaling factors that are produced or inhibited in response to dietary changes or certain dietary patterns and determine the molecular mechanisms by which they impact tumor formation and progression.5. determine whether the genetic, epigenetic, and physiological characteristics of individuals (such as their microbiome or history of exposure to drugs and chemical agents) can be used to identify critical host factor/nutrient interactions that impact tumor risk.6. examine how nutrient sensing pathways cross-talk and coordinate with other signaling pathways, such as those triggered by hormones and growth factors, to regulate cell and tissue homeostasis.7. determine what nutrient-sensing factors and pathways mediate outcomes of certain dietary patterns such as alcohol consumption or a high sugar diet to promote systemic or local inflammation and a pro-tumorigenic environmentexamples of projects not responsive to this foa:1. correlative studies on discovery/development of nutrition-based risk biomarkers2. translational studies for dietary treatments or adjuvant interventions in established tumors3. effects of caloric restriction/fasting/timing of food intake or intermittent fasting or physical activity studiesapplication and submission informationthis notice applies to due dates on or after february 5, 2022, and subsequent receipt dates through september 8, 2024.submit applications for this initiative using one of the following funding opportunity announcements (foas) or any reissues of these announcement through the expiration date of this notice.pa-20-195nih exploratory/developmental research grant program (parent r21 clinical trial not allowed)october 16, 2022all instructions in the sf424 (r&r) application guide and the funding opportunity announcement used for submission must be followed, with the following additions:applications nonresponsive to terms of this nosi will not be considered for the nosi initiative.scientific/research contact(s)phillip j. daschner, msc national cancer institute (nci) telephone: 240-276-6227 email: pd93u@nih.govsharon ross, phd, mph national cancer institute (nci) telephone: 240-276-7124 email: rosssha@mail.nih.govamit kumar, phd national cancer institute (nci) telephone: 240-276-7617 email: kumara@mail.nih.govpeer review contact(s)examine your era commons account for review assignment and contact information (information appears two weeks after the submission due date).financial/grants management contact(s)crystal wolfrey national cancer institute (nci) telephone: 240-276-6277 email: wolfreyc@mail.nih.govweekly toc for this announcement nih funding opportunities and noticesnote: for help accessing pdf, rtf, ms word, excel, powerpoint, audio or video files, see help downloading files.
