2) develop and test processes or strategies to implement, scale,and sustain evidence-based prevention in community, practice, and service systems;and,3) develop methods to conduct prevention science.primary outcomes of interest for submitted applications include preventing initiation of substance use, misuse, and progression to disorder, as well as prevention of hiv infection.this nosi encourages, but is not limited to, research applications in the following areas:intervention development and testing:efficacy and effectiveness research to examine intervention effects on initiation of drug use and progression from use to misuse to disorder. studies should further our understanding of mechanisms of action for preventing risky substance use and addiction. for example, by studying moderators and mediators of prevention effects and informingtailoring and optimizing interventions for settings and populations.translational intervention development research that uses findings from epidemiology, cognitive science, neuroscience, genetics and other diverse fields to develop and test prevention interventions.research on intervention strategies to reduce harm, such as preventing the transition from electronic nicotine device use to combustible cigarette use, preventing the initiation of injection drug use, preventing simultaneous use of psychoactive substances, or preventing substance use while operating a vehicle or machinery.methodology research for designing, testing and optimizing prevention interventions and policies; analytic models and statistical techniques for analyzing complex data and for testing mediation and moderation in longitudinal intervention studies.research that examines structural, environmental, or policy approaches to preventionstudies to intervene on upstream social determinants of health and address multiple levels of influence as defined by the national institute on minority health and health disparities (nimhd) research framework.research that addresses u.s. preventive services task force (uspstf)- and community preventive services task force (cpstf)- insufficient evidence statements as related to substance use and substance use disorders.prevention services research:research that develops and tests strategies, frameworks, or tools to implement and sustain, evidence-based prevention interventions in settings and systemsresearch on systems-level scale-up of evidence-based programs and system capacity (including workforce) to deliver interventions.studies of strategies for dissemination of evidence-based prevention servicesstudies to identify barriers and facilitators of implementing screening and referral to prevention services within service systems.research on access to and engagement in prevention services, particularly for hard-to-reach and underserved populations.interested investigators are encouraged to reach out to relevant program officers prior to submission.application and submission informationthis notice applies to due dates on or after june 5, 2022 and subsequent receipt dates through may 8, 2025.submit applications for this initiative using one of the following funding opportunity announcements (foas) or any reissues of these announcements through the expiration date of this notice.all instructions in the sf424 (r&r) application guide and the funding opportunity announcement used for submission must be followed, with the following additions:applications nonresponsive to terms of this nosi will not be considered for the nosi initiative.amy b. goldstein, phdnational institute on drug abuse (nida)telephone: 301.827.4124email: amy.goldstein@nih.govweekly toc for this announcement nih funding opportunities and noticesnote: for help accessing pdf, rtf, ms word, excel, powerpoint, audio or video files, see help downloading files.
