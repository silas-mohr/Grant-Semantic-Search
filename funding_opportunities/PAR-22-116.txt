low and middle income countries (lmics) that complements other global health research and research training programs in the mission areas of the nih institutes and centers. the overall goal of this initiative is to support the training of a sustainable critical mass of bioethics scholars in lmic research intensive institutions with the capabilities to conduct original empirical or conceptual ethics research that addresses challenging issues in health research and research policy in these countries. collaborative programs should be designed to recruit, select and rigorously train lmic individuals with the potential to become independent bioethics scholars, teach bioethics courses, and provide expert consultation to their institutions, governments and international research organizations. awards will support innovative u.s. - lmic collaborative institutional bioethics training programs that incorporate mentored research, advanced didactic theoretical and ethics career skill training elements to prepare a number of individuals for leadership positions in lmics.note: this funding opportunity announcement (foa) allows support of trainees proposing to serve as the lead investigator of an independent clinical trial; or proposing a separate ancillary clinical trial; or proposing to gain research experience in a clinical trial led by another investigator, as part of their research and career development.purpose and background information:since 2000, the fogarty international center (fic) and several nih ics have supported international bioethics education and research training awards in response to the increasing amount of collaborative global health research and scope of associated ethical concerns in lmics. the initial international research ethics education and curriculum development award (r25) (companion funding opportunity par-22-118) supported the establishment of sustainable master's level research ethics programs at research intensive lmic institutions (a list of currently funded awards can be found at https://www.fic.nih.gov/grants/search/pages/search-grants.aspx?program=bioet70). the more recent international bioethics research training program (d43) described in this funding opportunity supports lmic doctoral and long-term postdoctoral research training focused on the ethics of research in basic biomedical or clinical sciences, behavioral or social sciences, health services research, or any other discipline relevant to the nih mission and the health research priorities of lmics.this announcement supports collaborations between u.s. and lmic institutions to provide bioethics research training for multiple individuals with ethics expertise from lmic research intensive institutions. the primary objective of proposed programs should be to provide lmic trainees with advanced capabilities to conduct original empirical or conceptual research on critical ethical issues in health research in their countries. the proposed collaborative u.s.-lmic institutional doctoral and/or long-term postdoctoral training program should:-provide a strong foundation in research design, methods, and analytic techniques appropriate for the trainee's proposed bioethics research area;-enhance trainees’ ability to conceptualize, analyze and resolve bioethics research problems with increasing independence;-support mentored bioethics research by trainees using state-of-the-art methods as well as presenting and publishing their research findings;-furnish trainee opportunities to interact with the international bioethics academic community at appropriate conferences and workshops; and-significantly expand trainees’ understanding of the bioethics theory and ethical practice related to global health research.a secondary objective of proposed programs should be to provide training in the competencies necessary to sustain scholarly research careers in ethics leadership positions at their institutions in lmics as well as teaching and mentoring bioethics students and providing expert research ethics consultation.program considerationscollaboration: awards will support innovative u.s.-lmic collaborative institutional bioethics training programs. applicants are encouraged to collaborate with fic research and research training programs (http://www.fic.nih.gov/programs/pages/default.aspx) or other nih grantees working at the lmic institutions where trainees will be recruited. the proposed institutional research training program should complement other ongoing fic research training programs, including those supported by international research ethics education and curriculum development awards, however, the proposed program must be clearly distinct from any current ethics related training programs.faculty mentors: proposed faculty from the u.s. or other high-income countries should have international bioethics research expertise and experience in lmics. faculty from lmics with research ethics expertise should play significant roles in proposed programs to insure the relevance of the proposed research training and sustainable career development activities.each trainee should be matched to both a u.s. and lmic mentor to provide research and career guidance. mentorship training may be provided for faculty involved in the proposed program. it is expected that lmic trainees will be mentored and supported to disseminate the results of their research at bioethics conferences and in peer reviewed publications.trainees: pds/pis should limit the selection of doctoral and postdoctoral trainees to individuals from lmics who show documented evidence of research analytical skills as well as commitment to a bioethics career. trainees with previous masters' or doctoral level training or equivalent bioethics related experience and bioethics related publications are preferred.trainee research: in order to contribute to progress in both theory and practice in international bioethics, mentored research projects should focus on ethical issues faced in current research involving human subjects in lmics and be conducted to the greatest extent possible in these countries. trainee research is expected to lead to first author publications in leading international journals. applicants may submit applications that focus on research training in any thematic bioethics area that is of high significance to the lmic and/or specifically related to research supported by the participating nih ics such as:nhgri: ethical, legal, regulatory, policy, economic, cultural, and societal issues raised by the advancement and use of genomics. these issues may relate to the design and conduct of genetic and genomic research; the translation of genetic and genomic research into clinical medicine and health care; the interplay among a broad array of stakeholders in the field of genomics; and the value and meaning of genomics for the broader public. examples of possible topics of interest are available on the elsi research areas and sample topics website: https://www.genome.gov/funded-programs-projects/elsi-research-program/research-areas.all mentored research projects conducted with funding from this award must be approved by an independent committee using scientific review procedures established by the applicant institution (with documentation of education in the protection of human subjects for the trainee, compliance with legal requirements, and approval from an institutional (or ethical) review board or committee at the applicant institution and, if different, at the institution in which the research is being conducted if the projects include human subjects research).research training environment: original bioethics empirical and conceptual research is increasingly complex and multidisciplinary in nature. pds/pis are encouraged to develop institutional training programs that will expose trainees to a diversity of bioethics scholarship, systems for study, empirical and conceptual research approaches, and tools and technologies.research training may be delivered by interactive distance learning technology, if appropriate and sustainable for the lmic trainees and the institutions involved. if distance training is proposed, applicants should provide evidence of the technical feasibility of the chosen distance learning format in the lmic trainee setting.career development skills: training programs should make available structured, career mentorship and learning opportunities (e.g., workshops, networking activities, individual development planning). through such opportunities, trainees are expected to obtain a working knowledge of various potential career directions that make strong use of the knowledge and skills gained during ethics research training and the steps required to transition successfully to the next stage of their chosen research ethics career path and sustain research and scholarship.for applications proposing training in clinical trials research, plans for training in data management and statistics relevant to clinical trials, good clinical practice (gcp) and good laboratory practice (glp) should be included.short-term training or any undergraduate, clinical or masters-level training is not supported by these awards. masters level training for lmic participants can be supported by a international research ethics education and curriculum development award

appropriate to field of study and the level and prior preparation of the trainees?resubmissionsfor resubmissions, the committee will evaluate the application as now presented, taking into consideration the responses to comments from the previous scientific review group and changes made to the project.renewalsfor renewals, the committee will consider the progress made in the last funding period.. does the application describe the program’s accomplishments over the past funding period(s)? is the program achieving its training objectives? has the program evaluated the quality and effectiveness of the training experience and is there evidence that the evaluation outcomes and feedback from trainees have been acted upon? are changes proposed that are likely to improve or strengthen the research training experience during the next project period ? does the program continue to evolve and reflect changes in the research area in which the training occurs?revisionsnot applicable.as applicable for the project proposed, reviewers will consider each of the following items, but will not give scores for these items, and should not consider them in providing an overall impact score.training in the responsible conduct of researchall applications for support under this foa must include a plan to fulfill nih requirements for instruction in the responsible conduct of research (rcr). taking into account the specific characteristics of the training program, the level of trainee experience, and the particular circumstances of the trainees, the reviewers will evaluate the adequacy of the proposed rcr training in relation to the following five required components: 1) format - does the plan satisfactorily address the format of instruction, e.g., lectures, coursework and/or real-time discussion groups, including face-to-face interaction? (a plan involving only on-line instruction is not acceptable.); 2) subject matter – does the plan include a sufficiently broad selection of subject matter, such as conflict of interest, authorship, data management, human subjects and animal use, laboratory safety, research misconduct, research ethics? 3) faculty participation - does the plan adequately describe how faculty will participate in the instruction? for renewal applications, are all training faculty who served as course directors, speakers, lecturers, and/or discussion leaders during the past project period named in the application? 4) duration of instruction - does the plan meet the minimum requirements for rcr, i.e., at least eight contact hours of instruction? 5) frequency of instruction – does the plan meet the minimum requirements for rcr, i.e., at least once during each career stage (undergraduate, post-baccalaureate, predoctoral, postdoctoral, and faculty levels) and at a frequency of no less than once every four years?for renewal applications, does the progress report document acceptable rcr instruction in the five components described above? does the plan describe how participation in rcr instruction is being monitored? are appropriate changes in the plan for rcr instruction proposed in response to feedback and in response to evolving issues related to responsible conduct of research?plans and past record will be rated as acceptable or unacceptable, and the summary statement will provide the consensus of the review committee.budget and period of supportreviewers will consider whether the budget and the requested period of support are fully justified and reasonable in relation to the proposed research.applications will be evaluated for scientific and technical merit by (an) appropriate scientific review group(s), convened by the center for scientific review in accordance with nih peer review policy and procedures, using the stated review criteria.
