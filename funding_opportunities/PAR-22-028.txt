congress in the orphan drug act of 1983 and adopted by the fda, a rare disease is a condition that affects fewer than 200,000 people in the united states. ultra-rare diseases affect substantially fewer people, less than or equal to 6,000; in the u.s., this equates to as few or fewer than one in 50,000 people. approximately 95% of rare diseases, including ultra-rare diseases, have no fda-approved therapeutic available and an estimated 80% of rare diseases have an identified genetic origin. these rare diseases are often due to pathogenic variants in a single gene that alters gene product function. many rare and ultra-rare diseases are caused by different pathogenic variants, some of which may be unique to a single individual or to a very small number of individuals. cumulatively, these diseases represent a large unmet medical need as there are few available effective treatments and limited commercial incentive for therapeutic development.the ninds ultra-rare gene-based therapy (urgent) network addresses challenges within ultra-rare disease communities by facilitating and supporting the development of tailored therapeutic interventions using established precision medicine platforms for the treatment of individuals diagnosed with a debilitating and often fatal, ultra-rare neurological and/or neuromuscular disease. due to the urgency of these individuals’ conditions, rapid intervention in the clinical course of disease is critical. therefore, the selection of a viable therapeutic approach will require the ability to customize the design, testing, and delivery of these interventions.urgent is poised to leverage nonclinical and manufacturing data from one project to another to enable the continuous reassessment of best development practices and clinical outcomes data. this would make a platform approach to therapeutic development more accessible to the ultra-rare disease communities and applicable to a broader range of diseases. in addition, this approach aims to facilitate harmonization of efforts when possible and bring therapeutic interventions to individuals more efficiently.the design of early-phase clinical trials for gene-based therapies for individuals afflicted with ultra-rare disease often differs from the design of clinical trials for other types of therapies and relies upon unique collaborations to be successful. successful completion of the activities in this x01 is expected to generate supporting data for further advancement of a proposed therapeutic towards clinical trials.purposeninds established the urgent network to support the development, nonclinical, and clinical testing of gene-based or transcript-directed therapeutics for individuals with ultra-rare neurological disorders within the mission of ninds. the overarching goal of urgent is to rapidly advance precision therapeutics through manufacturing, nonclinical toxicology testing and other required ind-enabling activities, as well as evaluation in first-in-human (fih) clinical studies.the purpose of this foa is to provide investigators with a mechanism to access contract research/medical organizations (cros/cmos) and subject matter experts (smes) within the ninds urgent network to support planning, manufacturing, and limited nonclinical therapeutic development. contract access is in-kind and at no cost to the investigators.scope of the programurgent provides multiple pathways into the network for studies that propose to utilize urgent infrastructure and resources, culminating in submission of an ind package to the fda and preparation for a subsequent application to conduct a fih clinical trial. one path into the network is described in par-22-030 translational efforts to advance gene-based therapies for ultra-rare neurological and neuromuscular disorders (u01 - clinical trial optional) and seeks applications proposing to conduct formal ind-enabling activities and clinical trial planning activities. another path described in this foa allows direct access to resources for applicants proposing to conduct planning activities and limited nonclinical development studies with a clinical candidate therapeutic to generate additional data (as needed) before a pre-investigational new drug (ind) meeting or submission of an ind application.this ultra-rare gene-based therapy (urgent) network resource access (clinical trial not allowed) x01 encourages proposals from investigators for access to ninds contract resources to assist in the planning, manufacturing, and nonclinical development activities that may be required before submitting an ind package to the fda. prior to requesting a pre-ind meeting with the fda, the successful applicant will work with urgent smes to determine what kind of feedback is needed and identify potential issues within existing or future research plans, protocols, or existing data. only after potential issues are identified clearly can a plan to frame the discussion with the fda be determined. this planning will lead to specific, focused questions for the fda and help to identify considerations for future nonclinical and clinical therapeutic development activities.since a single ultra-rare disease may be caused by many different genetic variants, some of which may be unique to a very small numbers of individuals, the selection of a viable therapeutic approach will require the ability to customize the design, testing, and delivery of these interventions. the following gene-based and transcript-directed therapeutic modalities are potentially amenable to the development of precision gene-based or transcript-directed therapeutic approaches:oligonucleotide-based approaches oligonucleotides offer the potential to treat many genetic diseases by either ameliorating splicing pathogenic variants, promoting exon skipping, or targeting dominantly acting transcripts. oligonucleotide-based interventions for neurological diseases include but are not limited to antisense oligonucleotides (asos), small interfering rnas (sirna) or short hairpin rnas (shrna).viral vector-based approaches viral-based therapeutics (e.g., adeno-associated viruses (aavs) and other potential vector and/or delivery vehicles, containing the correct gene construct, may be used as an in vivo therapeutic approach to replace or knockdown expression of a disease-causing gene. alternatively, cell therapies involving ex vivo gene targeting may offer another therapeutic approach.genome editing-based approaches several platform technologies such as zinc finger nucleases (zfns), transcription activator-like effector-based nucleases (talens) and clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (crispr)-associated protein systems have emerged as promising approaches to correct disease-causing pathogenic variants.other gene-based therapeutic approaches small-molecule drugs that can selectively bind rna and modulate pre-mrna splicing have potential as a treatment strategy for human genetic diseases. therefore, these nucleic acid–targeted small molecules have therapeutic potential in the treatment of some ultra-rare neurological and neuromuscular diseases.leveraging ninds contract research resourcesurgent will provide successful applicants access to therapeutic development resources, ninds dedicated project management, and sme consultants. these ninds contract resources will assist investigators to rapidly advance patient-customized therapeutics through manufacturing and nonclinical toxicology testing. a list of current urgent resources can be found at http://www.ninds.nih.gov/current-research/research-funded-ninds/translational-research/urgent-network.urgent sme consultants will support successful applicants with strategic therapeutic development plans and assisting with preparation for a formal pre-ind meeting and/or submission of a pre-ind meeting package to the fda. once the investigator gathers characterization information, nonclinical data, and available clinical data, urgent sme consultants can also assist with planning and preparation activities associated with the preparation of the ind package.the sme consulting services may include support in disciplines such as:urgent nonclinical cros/cmos can support successful applicants by providing manufacturing, glp toxicology, and other limited nonclinical resources for ind package submission.the nonclinical cro/cmo contract resources may include support in areas such as:entry requirementsproposals that have rational proof of concept (poc) data obtained through scientifically rigorous experimentation for a viable gene-based or transcript-directed therapeutic clinical candidate for a specified ultra-rare disease patient population that supports nonclinical and clinical development are encouraged to apply.access to urgent contract resourcesfor each project provided access to the network, the ninds will assemble a customized multi-disciplinary project team (mpt). the mpt will include members of the pd/pi's team, additional sme consultants, and nih staff. the mpt will establish an overall strategy for the project with milestones, including a plan and timeline, to develop and coordinate activities across different urgent contract resources.each successful x01 applicant should expect to receive support for planning and/or implementation activities that will utilize the resources of and facilitate access to the contract resources of the ninds urgent network.the goal of the planning process is to develop a sufficiently detailed project development plan that will identify gaps and/or needs to support future regulatory interactions (e.g., pre-ind meetings and ind package). implementation is expected to include activities to generate data or obtain information as identified before a pre-ind meeting is conducted and/or an ind package is submitted.applications to this x01 should be limited to activities that can be completed within 2 years.planningexamples of planning activities that can be supported include, but are not limited to:implementationexamples of implementation activities that can be supported include, but are not limited to:scope limitationsaccess to the resources available within the ninds urgent network via an x01 is not intended to be a complete drug development program. furthermore, obtaining access to smes and/or cros/cmos does not guarantee a successful therapy development plan nor imply a successful application for funding to other nih programs.applications not responsive to this foaapplications that include any the following activities will be considered non-responsive and will not be reviewed:intellectual property rights and confidentialitythis program is structured so that the awardee institution retains their assignment of ip rights and gains assignment of ip rights from the urgent contractors (and thereby control the patent prosecution and licensing negotiations) for candidate therapeutics developed in this network. it is expected that the awardee institution will take responsibility for patent filings and maintenance and licensing efforts toward eventual commercialization. the pd/pi is expected to work closely with technology transfer/business development officials at his or her institution to ensure that royalty agreements, patent filings, and all other necessary ip arrangements are completed in a timely manner and that commercialization plans are developed and updated over the course of the project. award recipients will be encouraged to identify and foster relationships with potential licensing and commercialization partners early in the drug development process, consistent with the goals of urgent.all smes will treat information as confidential and not disclose data or their assessments to third parties.see section viii. other information for award authorities and

specified in each x01 foa. this includes programs where institutions will request access to submit to the resource (e.g., high throughput screening assays) as well as programs where access to a specific nih research resource is needed to conduct certain research. important factors in the peer review of x01 applications are the need for, and potential benefit of, gaining access to the resource, specifications for any assays proposed, timelines for completion and plans for follow-on studies.reviewers will provide an overall impact score to reflect their assessment of the likelihood for the project to exert a sustained, powerful influence on the research field(s) involved, in consideration of the following review criteria and additional review criteria (as applicable for the project proposed).review criteriaas applicable for the project proposed, reviewers will evaluate the following additional items while determining scientific and technical merit, and in providing an overall impact score, but will not give separate scores for these items.for this announcement, the following review criteria will be used:protections for human subjectsfor research that involves human subjects but does not involve one of the categories of research that are exempt under 45 cfr part 46, the reviewers will evaluate the justification for involvement of human subjects and the proposed protections from research risk relating to their participation according to the following five review criteria: 1) risk to subjects, 2) adequacy of protection against risks, 3) potential benefits to the subjects and others, 4) importance of the knowledge to be gained, and 5) data and safety monitoring for clinical trials.for research that involves human subjects and meets the criteria for one or more of the categories of research that are exempt under 45 cfr part 46, the reviewers will evaluate: 1) the justification for the exemption, 2) human subjects involvement and characteristics, and 3) sources of materials. for additional information on review of the human subjects section, please refer to the guidelines for the review of human subjects.inclusion of women, minorities, and individuals across the lifespanwhen the proposed project involves human subjects and/or nih-defined clinical research, the reviewers will evaluate the proposed plans for the inclusion (or exclusion) of individuals on the basis of sex/gender, race, and ethnicity, as well as the inclusion (or exclusion) of individuals of all ages (including children and older adults) to determine if it is justified in terms of the scientific goals and research strategy proposed. for additional information on review of the inclusion section, please refer to the guidelines for the review of inclusion in clinical research.vertebrate animalsthe reviewers will evaluate the involvement of live vertebrate animals as part of the scientific assessment according to the following criteria: (1) description of proposed
