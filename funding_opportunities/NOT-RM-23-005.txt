february 22, 2023pa-21-071 research supplements to promote diversity in health-related research (admin supp - clinical trial not allowed)office of strategic coordination (common fund) national human genome research institute (nhgri)national human genome research institute (nhgri)purposethe nih has a strong interest in the diversity of the nih-funded research enterprise (see nih notice not-od-20-031) and encourages institutions to diversify their scientific workforce by enhancing the participation of individuals from diverse backgrounds, including those groups identified as underrepresented in the biomedical, clinical, behavioral, and social sciences. this notice encourages eligible awardees to apply for administrative supplements in response to pa-21-071 (or any reissue of this announcement through the expiration date of this nosi) with the goal of promoting innovative research that enhances the utility and/or use of selected common fund datasets. providing these supplements may help enhance the utility and use of common fund data, promote the diversity of researchers using data generated by programs supported by the nih common fund and, more broadly, may help promote the diversity of the scientific research workforce, which is a key component of the nih strategy to identify, develop, support, and maintain the quality of our scientific human capital.backgroundsince its inception as the nih roadmap for biomedical research, the nih office of strategic coordination (common fund - https://commonfund.nih.gov/) has supported multiple transformative research programs that generate new technologies, methods, and data. many of these programs produced rich public data sets containing multi-dimensional molecular and phenotypic data from humans and model organisms. established common fund data sets listed below are well-poised for increased community use:additional information on some of these datasets can be found via the cfde portal.to maximize the impact of these data and to engage a broader, more diverse community of end-users, the common fund will support administrative supplements through pa-21-071 (or any reissue of this announcement through the expiration date of this nosi) for projects proposing to substantially leverage data from at least one of the above programs.objectives and scopeadministrative supplements must support work within the scope of the parent project. to be eligible for consideration through this nosi, the proposed research plan must substantially leverage data from at least one common fund program listed in the background section above. “substantial leverage” is defined as the use and citation of the relevant dataset(s) in the envisioned research products of the proposed work (e.g., manuscripts, presentations, book chapters, portals, etc.) data from other publicly available datasets, including common fund programs not listed above, can be included as needed. the accompanying training plan should be well described and must have the strong potential to significantly advance the candidate’s research career development. because information regarding the user experience could help nih improve its data resources, successful applicants will be asked to provide feedback on the findability, usability, and utility of the relevant datasets and public data portals. they may also be afforded an opportunity to present their work at an nih-sponsored meeting (either virtually or in-person). beyond that, there are no explicit requirements for how the data are to be used – investigators are encouraged to employ approaches best suited to achieving their parent award’s research aims.the research plan should be appropriate to the academic/career level of the candidate and discussed in sufficient detail to clarify the goals, milestones, and objectives of the proposed work. no aim removed in response to the initial peer review from the parent grant may be proposed as the basis for a supplement. the supplemental aims must be in scope and synergistic with the approved, ongoing research of the parent grant. they must also have the potential to contribute significantly to the candidate's research career development.the training plan for the candidate should enable and encourage interactions with other individuals on the parent grant, intellectual contributions to the research, and enhancement of the candidate’s research skills and scientific knowledge. it must also provide clear opportunities for development as a productive researcher and interactions with the scientific community (e.g., presentations at seminars, attendance of meetings, publication of manuscripts, and participation in mentoring/networking activities). furthermore, it must demonstrate that the pd(s)/pi(s) is/are willing to provide appropriate mentorship consistent with the nih notice encouraging the adoption and use of individual development plans.applicants are strongly encouraged to discuss their proposed supplement project with the ico program officer of the funded parent award prior to submission of a supplement application, to ensure that the proposed activity aligns with the scientific priorities of the ico and is within the scope of the parent award. scientific inquiries may also be addressed to the contacts listed in the inquiries section below.data management and sharing planall applicants planning research (funded or conducted in whole or in part by nih) that results in the generation of scientific data are required to comply with the instructions for the data management and sharing plan. all applications, regardless of the amount of direct costs requested for any one year, must address a data management and sharing plan (see not-od-22-189). applicants must consider and describe the anticipated timeline, formats, and methods for depositing products (e.g., computational, annotation, etc.) created under this foa into a relevant public repository or relevant cf data coordinating center. where applicable, the applicants should describe how they plan to share any tools, pipelines, or workflows through open access channels (e.g., public github links).reporting requirementsrecipients of administrative supplements are required to report progress associated with the supplement activities in the annual rppr and/or the frppr, as applicable. for these supplements, the reporting expectation is that major accomplishments and career development activities during the relevant budget period are listed explicitly and with enough detail to allow evaluation of progress. additionally, if funding will continue into the next budget period, planned activities should be discussed at the same level of granularity. failure to comply with these reporting requirements may result in delayed processing of the non-competing continuation and/or delays of the award closeout.funds available and anticipated number of awardsthe number of awards is contingent upon nih appropriations and receipt of responsive, rigorous applications.application and submission instructionsrecently issued nih policy notices may affect your application submission.
