health and human services partners. you must use one of these submission options to access the application forms for this opportunity.a. overviewrecent advances in neuroscience offer unprecedented opportunities to discover new treatments for nervous system disorders. however, before a new chemical entity can be tested in a clinical setting, it must undergo a process of chemical optimization to improve potency, selectivity, and drug-like properties, followed by pre-clinical safety testing to meet the standards set by the food and drug administration (fda) for clinical testing. all of the necessary expertise and resources are not commonly available to small companies as these activities are largely the domain of large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies and contract research organizations.to facilitate drug discovery and development by the neuroscience community, the nih blueprint for neuroscience research (https://neuroscienceblueprint.nih.gov/) established the blueprint neurotherapeutics network (bpn), which offers neuroscience researchers funding for drug discovery and development activities that can be conducted in their own laboratories. researchers have the opportunity to collaborate with nih-funded consultants and contract research organizations (cros) that specialize in medicinal chemistry, pharmacokinetics, toxicology, formulations development, chemical synthesis under good manufacturing practices (gmp), and phase i clinical testing. a current list of bpn contractors and consultants is available at https://neuroscienceblueprint.nih.gov/bpdrugs/bpn_resources.htm.this funding opportunity announcement (foa) invites applications for new bpn projects. the pd/pi will be responsible for conducting all studies that involve disease- or target-specific assays, models, and other research tools. a program director/principal investigator (pd/pi) with- for example medicinal chemistry expertise and resources may additionally request funding to conduct structure-activity relationship (sar) studies in his or her own lab but collaborate with bpn contractors on in vitro admet, in vivo pk, drug manufacturing and ind-enabling toxicology studies. by contrast, a pd/pi with limited experience in drug discovery and development may opt to collaborate with all available bpn contractors. applicants may propose to conduct all drug discovery and development activities themselves or collaborate with bpn contractors on activities of their choice.for each project funded under this foa, the nih will assemble a customized lead development team (ldt). the ldt will be co-chaired by the pd/pi and a bpn consultant and will include members of the pd/pi's team, additional bpn consultants, and nih staff. the ldt will establish an overall strategy for the project, including milestones proposals, plan studies to be conducted by bpn contractors, and coordinate activities across different research sites.potential applicants are strongly encouraged to read frequently asked questions (faqs) on the bpn website (http://neuroscienceblueprint.nih.gov/bpdrugs/faqs.htm) and contact nih scientific/research staff and participating nih institutes/centers prior to preparing an application to discuss how they may best utilize bpn resources and whether their application fits the mission of a particular nih ic.for this foa, phase i clinical testing, studies or trials refer to the common phases of a clinical trial. u44 phase i and ii refer to the project phases of the sbir program.b. scopethe bpn is dedicated to the discovery and development of small molecule compounds, of a size and structure that can be readily synthesized and chemically modified (if optimization is required). this program is not designed to support development of biologics or biotechnology products, including oligonucleotides and proteins, or devices. applicants should contact nih scientific/research staff regarding small peptides (typically less than 6 amino acids) and other complex chemical structures, as well as combination therapies, to determine suitability for optimization and development within the bpn.to be eligible for this foa, a project must focus on a nervous system condition that falls within the mission of one of the participating institutes or centers. please see section c below for more information on the interests of the participating institutes and centers and alternative programs to consider.projects can enter either at the discovery stage, to optimize promising hit compounds through medicinal chemistry to the development stage, to advance a single development candidate through investigational new drug (ind)-enabling toxicology studies and phase i clinical testing. alternatively, projects can enter at the development stage and progress in a shorter period to ind enabling toxicology studies and phase i clinical testing.past experience with bpn suggests that many otherwise excellent awarded projects often require additional proof of concept data or the generation of tools in order to meet the program's requirements for initiating medicinal chemistry or ind-enabling studies. for this reason, all bpn sbir projects will begin with the u44 phase i to conduct feasibility studies required to launch medicinal chemistry (if entering at the discovery stage) or ind-enabling studies (if entering at the development stage). during the u44 phase i award, the nih will form the ldt, which will identify and oversee the studies necessary to meet the bpn requirements for initiating medicinal chemistry or ind-enabling studies. the ldt will also design plans and go/no-go milestones for all subsequent discovery and/or development work. progression from u44 phase i to phase ii will be based on administrative review (see section d., milestones). a project that completes all u44 phase i and phase ii discovery activities and advances into development will conduct all development work (including development feasibility studies) under the u44 phase ii award. after successful completion of the u44 phase i, a project may proceed either to the u44 phase ii in either hit-to-lead/lead optimization (sar) (the discovery phase) or to ind-enabling studies (the development phase).a schematic of this project structure is available on the bpn website at https://neuroscienceblueprint.nih.gov/bpdrugs/bpn_resources.htm .the following sections describe the discovery and development stages in more detail, including the program entry criteria, the program requirements for initiating medicinal chemistry and ind-enabling studies, and examples of activities that can be conducted during the u44 phase i award. potential applicants are strongly encouraged to contact nih scientific/research staff prior to preparing an application to clarify which entry stage is most appropriate for their project and what to include in their plans for the u44 phase i award.discoveryprojects that require medicinal chemistry to improve the potency and/or drug-like properties of promising bioactive compounds will enter the bpn at the discovery stage. the process of understanding the structure-activity relationship (sar) for desired drug properties typically requires dozens of rounds of compound synthesis and testing. initially, medicinal chemistry will focus heavily on optimizing activity and potency of compounds in primary and secondary in vitro assays. subsequently, sar will increase emphasis on admet (absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, toxicity) properties of the compounds, with continued monitoring and optimization of bioactivity. the ultimate goal of the sar effort is the selection of a development candidate with sufficient bioactivity, therapeutic index, and drug-like properties to proceed to ind-directed pre-clinical safety assessment with reasonable projected human doses.entry criteria for discovery stageprojects must meet the following requirements prior to entering discovery:feasibility studies for discovery stage (u44 phase i)all discovery projects will begin with a u44 phase i award of up to two years. the first 6-12 months should be used to prepare for sar studies. the following are general expectations for a bpn project to initiate sar studies:examples of activities that can be supported include:the pd(s)/pi(s) will be responsible for conducting all studies that involve disease- or target-specific assays, models, and other research tools. applicants may propose to use bpn contractors for chemical synthesis and admet profiling or request funds to conduct this work themselves.the discovery u44 phase i award typically supports the following activities :discovery activities after feasibility phase (u44 phase ii)the bpn typically supports up to one additional year of medicinal chemistry to complete the sar studies to identify a development candidate that meets the entry criteria for development (below).the discovery u44 phase ii award typically supports the following activities:the pd/pi will be responsible for conducting primary in vitro biological assessment of compounds on a one-to-two week schedule to inform the design of subsequent iterations of compound synthesis. in addition to a regular testing schedule in the primary assay, the pd/pi will provide confirmation of the activity of select compounds in secondary and counter-screening assays and animal models relevant to the drug target and therapeutic indication.bpn contractors can produce compound analogs for sar testing, scale up compounds as needed for in vivo testing, and provide standard screening services to assess in vitro and in vivo admet characteristics of the compounds. typically, bpn will assign four medicinal chemist ftes to a project, generating approximately 4-8 compounds per week, plus additional staff to support computational chemistry modeling and admet studies as appropriate.compounds that meet the bpn's criteria for a development candidate can continue seamlessly on into development.developmentthe development stage includes ind-directed preclinical safety studies, gmp synthesis of clinical trial material, formulation development, and phase i clinical testing. projects that have completed medicinal chemistry optimization and identified a development candidate may initiate development activities within bpn. the bpn does not support sar studies during development.entry criteria for development stageapplication for entry into the development stage must have identified the candidate compound and cannot request additional medicinal chemistry resources. it may be acceptable to have 2 candidates that will be narrowed to a single candidate as part of the u44 phase i activities (time and budget permitting).projects must meet the following requirements prior to entering the development portion of the u44 phase ii:feasibility studies for developmentall applications proposing to enter at the development stage at the start of the u44 phase ii will begin with a u44 phase i award of up to two years, to prepare for ind-enabling studies, which will be supported under the u44 phase ii award. (projects that began in discovery will conduct these activities during their u44 phase ii award.) the following are general expectations for a project to initiate ind-enabling studies within bpn:examples of activities that can be supported during the development preparatory activities include:the pd(s)/pi(s) is responsible for conducting all studies that involve disease- or target-specific assays, models, and other research tools. bpn contractors can perform all other work.development activities after feasibility phase (u44 phase ii)the development u44 phase ii award may include the following:the pd/pi's institution will be responsible for assembly and submission of the ind application and scheduling meetings with the fda and therefore should include support for this activity in their plan. nih staff and consultants on the ldt must be included in all meetings with the fda.the development of the protocol and management of the phase i clinical trial will be performed by a clinical development team (cdt), which will evolve from the ldt and include the pd/pi, clinical consultants identified by the pd/pi and nih, and nih staff. the protocol, selected supporting trial documents, and regulatory documents will be submitted to nih for administrative review (including internal and external experts) prior to commencement of the clinical trial (defined as signing of first informed consent).bpn contractors can conduct the preclinical safety studies, gmp synthesis, formulation and other activities required to prepare for human testing. bpn contractors will provide data and reports in a format suitable for inclusion in an ind application and will assist in the development of the application. the phase i clinical trial can also be conducted through bpn contractors.projects not appropriate for this announcement include:c. nih institute and center interests and guidancenational institute on aging (nia)nia is interested in studies that will provide drug development expertise and infrastructure support to researchers interested in developing new small molecules aimed at modifying the behavioral symptoms in alzheimer's disease (ad), delaying the onset or slowing the progression of ad, mild cognitive impairment (mci), other dementias of aging and age-related cognitive decline. ideally, this initiative is aimed at researchers who have promising small molecule compounds but lack the necessary outside expertise and infrastructure to advance these compounds to the clinic.researchers who may have the necessary drug development expertise and access to infrastructure to advance small molecules to the clinic should consider submitting an application to the alzheimer's drug development program (par-18-820) or its reissue. this program is also available to researchers who are interested in the preclinical development of biologics or repurposed drugs.nia and the ad scientific community recognize that one of the major challenges to the successful development of drugs for ad is the poor translation of preclinical efficacy from ad animal models to the clinic. meta analyses of preclinical studies indicate that a key factor contributing to the poor predictive power of ad animal models is the lack of standards in the design, conduct, and data analyses. therefore, to improve the quality and predictive value of animal model studies nia urges applicants, describing supporting data or proposed animal model studies, to follow best practices guidelines as summarized at: http://alzres.com/content/3/5/28).national institute on alcohol abuse and alcoholism (niaaa)alcohol interacts directly and indirectly with a wide spectrum of molecular targets in the brain, and alcohol-seeking behaviors and alcohol use disorders (aud) involve multiple neurotransmitter systems, neuromodulators, hormones, signal transduction pathways, etc. these include signaling systems and signal transduction pathways of opioids, serotonin, dopamine, glutamate, ?-aminobutyric acid (gaba), endocannabinoids, neuropeptides (e.g. corticotropin releasing factor (crf), neuropeptide y, substance p), and protein kinases a and c. numerous therapeutic agents targeting these and other molecular systems have been studied preclinically and in clinical trials. niaaa is interested in research aimed to develop new pharmaceuticals to provide effective therapy for aud. studies involving novel targets previously un-recognized or understudied for the treatment of aud are particularly encouraged. specific genetic variants that may contribute to the risk for alcoholism and/or render alcohol dependent individuals responsive to specific therapeutic agent have been discovered. niaaa is interested in supporting research to develop pharmaceuticals targeting individuals with identified genotypic and phenotypic characteristics to improve efficacy and safety.national eye institute (nei)the national eye institute (nei) interest in blueprintneurotherapeutics is to develop novel therapies to treat diseases and disorders of the visual system, especially blinding eye diseases such as cataracts, glaucoma, age-related macular degeneration, retinitis pigmentosa, ocular pain and other conditions. the nei is also interested in other visual system disorders such as strabismus and amblyopia that could be treated with pharmacological interventions. each project should have a well-defined end-point, achievable within a five-year time frame, for developing a treatment for a specific disease or disorder of the visual system. the steps towards this goal should be clearly delineated in a series of milestones that support the development of a novel therapeutic that can then be tested in a clinical trial. if successful, a project funded under this program may lead to filing an ind-directed pharmacological and toxicological study, and phase i clinical testing. investigators are encouraged to contact nei program staff to discuss potential research projects prior to application submission to determine alignment of the planned studies with priorities of the institute.national institute of dental and craniofacial research (nidcr)nidcr is interested in neurotherapeutics development for painful disorders of the orofacial region including temporomandibular joint disorder, trigeminal neuropathies, burning mouth syndrome, oral cancer pain and other conditions. recent advances in genomics and phenotyping of subjects with orofacial pain conditions have expanded the scope of potential targets to treat these conditions. receptor systems, ion channels, and pro- and anti-inflammatory molecules have been implicated in chronic pain. nidcr is interested in supporting research that will lead to highly efficacious and specific pharmacological treatments for individuals with orofacial pain disorders.investigators are encouraged to contact nidcr program staff to discuss potential research projects prior to application submission to determine alignment of the planned studies with priorities of the institute mission and strategic plan.eunice kennedy shriver national institute of child health and human development (nichd)the nichd is interested in supporting neurotherapeutic research aimed to discover small molecules and compounds, and develop novel and improved pharmacotherapies for developmental disorders, diseases and conditions in pediatric population.investigators are strongly encouraged to contact nichd program staff to discuss their potential research projects prior to application submission to determine alignment of their planned studies with the nichd's priorities and strategic plan.national institute of mental health (nimh)nimh supports neuroscience research to discover the causes of mental illness and to develop more effective and safer treatments. the nimh is interested in applications proposing development of therapies aimed at novel molecular and clinical targets for the treatment of mental disorders, especially treatment-resistant depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, ptsd, and autism spectrum disorder. studies aimed at the development of new ligands for targets where a probe or therapeutic already exists are generally of lower priority.nimh will only support projects entering the bpn at the discovery (optimization of validated small molecule hits and promising lead compounds through medicinal chemistry) stage. nimh will not support projects entering the bpn at the development (ind enabling/gmp synthesis or phase i trials) stage. projects at the development stage should consider applying to the nimh sbir/sttr programs. projects at the early clinical trials phase should consider the nimh sbir/sttr programs.or the first in human and early stage clinical trials of novel investigational drugs or devices for psychiatric disorders (u01) par-18-427. investigators are strongly encouraged to discuss their research plans with nimh scientific/research contact prior to submission to determine alignment of the planned studies with nimh priorities and to assess whether this or other nimh funding opportunities are most appropriate. investigators are also encouraged to review the following nimh drug discovery foas: drug discovery for nervous system disorders par-19-147 (r01) and par-19-146 (r21), assay development and screening for discovery of chemical probes or therapeutic agents par-17-484 (r01), discovery of in vivo chemical probes for novel brain targets par-17-336 (r01), discovery of cell-based chemical probes for novel brain targets par-17-335 (r21), national cooperative drug discovery/development groups (ncddg) for the treatment of mental disorders, drug or alcohol addiction par-18-230 (u01) and par-18-231 (u19).consistent with nimh's research domain criteria (rdoc) initiative, research projects directed towards ameliorating pathophysiology that is potentially more proximal to specific functional deficits (domains) than dsm diagnostic entities are encouraged. additional information about the rdoc approach can be found at the rdoc website. the testing of functional domains not included specifically in rdoc may also be considered, if well justified. in vivo preclinical screening assays in animals should be carefully selected based on proposed brain targets and mechanisms of therapeutic action (see not-mh-19-053).high-quality and reproducible studies that are reported to the scientific community in a transparent manner are an essential cornerstone of the research enterprise. attention to principles of study design and transparency are essential to enable reviewers, the scientific community, and nih to assess the quality of scientific findings. in support of this important goal, investigators must follow instructions to address rigor and reproducibility (http://grants.nih.gov/reproducibility/index.htm).further information on nimh research priorities can be found in the nimh strategic plan, strategic research priorities, and interventions workgroup report. applicants are strongly encouraged to discuss applications with nimh staff listed in section vii - agency contact(s) scientific/research contacts.national institute of neurological disorder sand stroke (ninds)a list of diseases that is relevant to the research mission of the ninds can be found at https://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/all-disorders ; applicants are encouraged to contact the ninds to discuss disease areas of interest.this foa serves as the primary support mechanism at ninds for the discovery and development of small molecule drugs. researchers focused on the development of biologics and biotechnology products should consider the create-bio program (https://www.ninds.nih.gov/current-research/research-funded-ninds/translational-research/create-bio ). applicants seeking support only to conduct early stage clinical trials should consider applying for an ninds exploratory clinical trials r01, through par-18-420, which provides additional flexibility in budget and time, as well as the option of including a phase ii trial.there is growing recognition that the quality and reproducibility of both preclinical and clinical research depend on the rigor with which researchers conduct studies, control for potential bias, and report essential methodological details. examples of critical elements of a well-designed study are summarized on the ninds website http://www.ninds.nih.gov/funding/transparency_in_reporting_guidance.pdf. ninds urges applicants to this program to consider these elements when describing supporting data and proposed studies.national center for complementary and integrative health (nccih)nccih is interested in supporting research aimed at compounds and small molecules from natural products (e.g., cannabinoids, venoms, conotoxins, melatonin, prebiotics, probiotics, herbs, etc.) that may be used or developed to modulate cns-based symptoms with priority given to pain and pain related symptoms including sleep, stress, and mood disorders. investigators are strongly encouraged to discuss their research plans with the nccih scientific/research contact prior to submitting their applications.national institute on drug abuse (nida)through participating in this foa, nida aims to provide drug development expertise and infrastructure to support the addiction researchers interested in developing new molecular entities for the treatment of substance use disorders (sud). projects focused on opioid use disorder, cocaine, methamphetamine and marijuana use disorders are of high priority for nida.nida will only support the projects to develop the innovative pharmacological approaches entering the bpn at the discovery stage. specifically, nida is interested in using the bpn mechanism to support the addiction researchers in the "hit to lead optimization" stages with a well-justified proposal for the development stage as well.nida applicants are strongly encouraged to take full advantage of the opportunities the bpn affords, including collaboration with bpn consultants and nih-supported contract research organizations (cros) that specialize in medicinal chemistry, pharmacokinetics, toxicology, formulations development, chemical synthesis under good manufacturing practices (gmp). researchers, who possess the drug development expertise and access to the necessary infrastructure to advance small molecules to the clinic, should consider submitting their applications to specialized nida-administered programs.investigators are strongly encouraged to discuss their research plans with nida program staff prior to submission to determine alignment of the planned studies with nida's interest and priorities. nida staff will also provide help in assessing whether this or other nida funding opportunities would be the most appropriate.d. milestonesbecause drug discovery and development are inherently high risk, it is expected that there will be significant attrition as projects progress. go/no-go milestones (typically every six months) will be established by the ldt at the start of each project and updated as needed.an administrative review will be conducted by nih program staff, with technical input from an external oversight committee (composed of senior non-federal scientists who are not directly involved in bpn projects), to decide which projects will advance from the u44 phase i to the phase ii award and progress after each subsequent milestone based on:approval for commencement of a clinical trial (defined as signing of informed consent by first prospective subject) will include the following:please note: if a funded project does not make sufficient progress toward the agreed upon milestones at any stage, funding for the project and access to bpn contract resources may be discontinued (see section vi.2.).e. quality and compliance requirementssince the goal of this program is to generate therapeutics which will be eligible for fda approval, adherence to compliance and quality criteria is required.all clinical trials must be performed following good clinical practices (gcp) and in accord with nih policy for data and safety monitoring (https://osp.od.nih.gov/clinical-research/nih-data-and-safety-monitoring-policies/).investigational products for use in clinical trials must be produced under current good manufacturing practice (cgmp) practices.f. intellectual property (ip)since the ultimate goal of this program is to bring new drugs to the market, the creation and protection of intellectual property (ip) that will make drug candidates attractive to potential licensing and commercialization partners are a significant consideration in designing research strategies and prioritizing projects for funding. this program is structured so that the small business concern retains their assignment of ip rights and gains assignment of ip rights from the bpn contractors (and thereby control the patent prosecution and licensing negotiations) for drug candidates developed through this program. it is expected that the small business concern will take responsibility for patent filings, maintenance and licensing efforts toward eventual commercialization. the pd/pi is expected to work closely with technology transfer/business development officials at his or her institution to ensure that royalty agreements, patent filings, and all other necessary ip arrangements are completed in a timely manner and that commercialization plans are developed and updated over the course of the project. award recipients will be encouraged to identify and foster relationships with potential licensing and commercialization partners early in the drug development process, consistent with the goals of the bpn.the oer glossary and the sf424 (r&r) application guide provide details on these application types. only those application types listed here are allowed for the foa.need help determining whether you are doing a clinical trial?pa/par:the number of awards is contingent upon nih appropriations and the submission of a sufficient number of meritorious applications.application budgets are not limited but must reflect the actual needs of the proposed project.applicants should rarely exceed up to $500,000 total cost per year for phase i and up to $1,500,000 total cost per year for the phase ii. in all cases, applicants should propose a budget that is reasonable and appropriate for completion of the research project. application budgets should only cover the work that will be performed by the pd/pi and his/her staff. the nih will pay bpn contractors and consultants directly for their work; therefore, these expenses should not be included in the budget for this application.durations up to 2 years for phase i and up to 3 years for phase ii may be requested.only united states small business concerns (sbcs) are eligible to submit applications for this opportunity. a small business concern is one that, at the time of award of phase i and phase ii, meets all of the following criteria:if the concern is more than 50% owned by multiple venture capital operating companies, hedge funds, private equity firms, or any combination of these falls under 3 (ii) or 3 (iii) above, see section iv. application and submission information for additional instructions regarding required application certification.if an employee stock ownership plan owns all or part of the concern, each stock trustee and plan member is considered an owner.if a trust owns all or part of the concern, each trustee and trust beneficiary is considered an owner.definitions:sbcs must also meet the other regulatory requirements found in 13 c.f.r. part 121. business concerns, other than investment companies licensed, or state development companies qualifying under the small business investment act of 1958, 15 u.s.c. 661, et seq., are affiliates of one another when either directly or indirectly, (a) one concern controls or has the power to control the other; or (b) a third-party/parties controls or has the power to control both. business concerns include, but are not limited to, any individual (sole proprietorship) partnership, corporation, joint venture, association, or cooperative. the sf424 (r&r) sbir/sttr application guide should be referenced for detailed eligibility information.small business concerns that are more than 50% owned by multiple venture capital operating companies, hedge funds, private equity firms, or any combination of these are not eligible to apply to the nih sttr program.performance benchmark requirementsphase i to phase ii transition rate benchmark: in accordance with guidance from the sba, the hhs sbir/sttr program is implementing the phase i to phase ii transition rate benchmark required by the sbir/sttr reauthorization act of 2011 and the sbir and sttr extension act of 2022. the benchmark establishes a minimum number of phase ii awards the company must have received relative to a given number of phase i awards received during the 5-fiscal year time period. the transition rate is calculated as the total number of sbir and sttr phase ii awards a company received during the past 5 fiscal years divided by the total number of sbir and sttr phase i awards it received during the past 5 fiscal years excluding the most recently-completed year. the transition rate requirement, agreed upon and established by all 11 sbir agencies, was published for public comment in a federal register notice on october 16, 2012 (77 fr 63410) and amended on may 23, 2013 (78 fr 30951).on june 1 of each year, sba will identify the companies that fail to meet minimum performance requirements.sba calculates individual company phase i to phase ii transition rates using sbir and sttr award information across all federal agencies. sba will notify companies and the relevant officials at the participating agencies. more information on the phase i to phase ii transition rate requirement is available at sbir.gov.phase ii to commercialization benchmark: in accordance with guidance from the sba, the hhs sbir/sttr programs are implementing the phase ii to commercialization rate benchmark for phase i applicants, as required by the sbir/sttr reauthorization act of 2011 and the sbir and sttr extension act of 2022. the commercialization rate benchmark was published in a federal register notice on august 8, 2013 (78 fr 48537), with a reopening of the comment period published on september 26, 2013 (78 fr 59410).non-domestic (non-u.s.) components of u.s. organizations are not eligible to apply.foreign components, as defined in the nih grants policy statement, may be allowed.applicant organizations must complete and maintain the following registrations as described in the sf 424 (r&r) application guide to be eligible to apply for or receive an award. all registrations must be completed prior to the application being submitted. registration can take 6 weeks or more, so applicants should begin the registration process as soon as possible. the nih policy on late submission of grant applications states that failure to complete registrations in advance of a due date is not a valid reason for a late submission.program directors/principal investigators (pd(s)/pi(s))all pd(s)/pi(s) must have an era commons account. pd(s)/pi(s) should work with their organizational officials to either create a new account or to affiliate their existing account with the applicant organization in era commons. if the pd/pi is also the organizational signing official, they must have two distinct era commons accounts, one for each role. obtaining an era commons account can take up to 2 weeks.under the sbir program, for both phase i and phase ii, the primary employment of the pd/pi must be with the small business concern at the time of award and during the conduct of the proposed project. for projects with multiple pds/pis, at least one must meet the primary employment requirement. occasionally, deviations from this requirement may occur.for the sttr program, the pd(s)/pi(s) may be employed with the sbc or the single, "partnering" non-profit research institution as long as s/he has a formal appointment with or commitment to the applicant sbc, which is characterized by an official relationship between the sbc and that individual. such a relationship does not necessarily involve a salary or other form of remuneration the primary employment of the pd/pi must be with the sbc or the research institution (where they are pd/pi at) at the time of award and during the conduct of the proposed project.each pd/pi must commit a minimum of 10% effort to the project.number of applicationsnih will not accept similar grant applications with essentially the same research focus from the same applicant organization. this includes derivative or multiple applications that propose to develop a single product, process, or service that, with non-substantive modifications, can be applied to a variety of purposes. applicants may not simultaneously submit identical/essentially identical applications under both this funding opportunity and any other hhs funding opportunity, including the sbir and sttr parent announcements.the nih will not accept duplicate or highly overlapping applications under review at the same time. this means that the nih will not accept:a phase i awardee may submit a phase ii application either before or after expiration of the phase i budget period, unless the awardee elects to submit a phase i and phase ii application concurrently under the fast-track procedure. to maintain eligibility to seek phase ii or iib support, a phase i awardee should submit a phase ii application, and a phase ii awardee should submit a phase iib application, within the first six due dates following the expiration of the phase i or ii budget period, respectively.in phase i, normally, a minimum of two-thirds or 67% of the research or analytical effort must be carried out by the small business concern. the total amount of all consultant and contractual arrangements to third parties for portions of the scientific and technical effort generally may not exceed 33% of the total amount requested (direct, f&a/indirect, and fee).in phase ii, normally, a minimum of one-half or 50% of the research or analytical effort must be carried out by the small business concern. the total amount of consultant and contractual arrangements to third parties for portions of the scientific and technical effort generally may not exceed 50% of the total phase ii amount requested (direct, f&a/indirect, and fee).a small business concern may subcontract a portion of its sbir or sttr award to a federal laboratory within the limits above. a federal laboratory, as defined in 15 u.s.c. Â§ 3703, means any laboratory, any federally funded research and development center, or any center established under 15 u.s.c. Â§Â§ 3705 & 3707 that is owned, leased, or otherwise used by a federal agency and funded by the federal government, whether operated by the government or by a contractor.the basis for determining the percentage of work to be performed by each of the cooperative parties in phase i or phase ii will be the total of the requested costs attributable to each party, unless otherwise described and justified in "consortium/contractual arrangements" of the phs 398 research plan component of sf424 (r&r) application forms.additional details are contained in the sf424 (r&r) sbir/sttr application

compliance with federal civil rights law. this means that recipients of hhs funds must ensure equal access to their programs without regard to a person's race, color, national origin, disability, age and, in some circumstances, sex and religion. this includes ensuring your programs are accessible to persons with limited english proficiency. hhs recognizes that research projects are often limited in scope for many reasons that are nondiscriminatory, such as the principal investigator's scientific interest, funding limitations, recruitment requirements, and other considerations. thus, criteria in research protocols that target or exclude certain populations are warranted where nondiscriminatory justifications establish that such criteria are appropriate with respect to the health or safety of the subjects, the scientific study design, or the purpose of the research.for additional guidance regarding how the provisions apply to nih grant programs, please contact the scientific/research contact that is identified in section vii under agency contacts of this foa. hhs provides general guidance to recipients of ffa on meeting their legal obligation to take reasonable steps to provide meaningful access to their programs by persons with limited english proficiency. please see https://www.hhs.gov/civil-rights/for-individuals/special-topics/limited-english-proficiency/index.html. the hhs office for civil rights also provides guidance on complying with civil rights laws enforced by hhs. please see https://www.hhs.gov/civil-rights/for-individuals/section-1557/index.html; andhttps://www.hhs.gov/civil-rights/for-providers/laws-regulations-guidance/index.html.recipients of ffa also have specific legal obligations for serving qualified individuals with disabilities. please see https://www.hhs.gov/civil-rights/for-individuals/disability/index.html. please contact the hhs office for civil rights for more information about obligations and prohibitions under federal

the statutory provisions contained in section 872 of the duncan hunter national defense authorization act of fiscal year 2009 (public law 110-417), nih awards will be subject to the federal awardee performance and integrity information system (fapiis) requirements. fapiis requires federal award making officials to review and consider information about an applicant in the designated integrity and performance system (currently fapiis) prior to making an award. an applicant, at its option, may review information in the designated integrity and performance systems accessible through fapiis and comment on any information about itself that a federal agency previously entered and is currently in fapiis. the federal awarding agency will consider any comments by the applicant, in addition to other information in fapiis, in making a judgement about the applicant's integrity, business ethics, and record of performance under federal awards when completing the review of risk posed by applicants as described in 45 cfr part 75.205 "federal awarding agency review of risk posed by applicants." this provision will apply to all nih grants and cooperative agreements except fellowships.the following special terms of award are in addition to, and not in lieu of, otherwise applicable u.s. office of management and budget (omb) administrative guidelines, u.s. department of health and human services (dhhs) grant administration regulations at 45 cfr parts 75 , and other hhs, phs, and nih grant administration policies. the administrative and funding instrument used for this program will be the cooperative agreement, an "assistance" mechanism (rather than an "acquisition" mechanism), in which substantial nih programmatic involvement with the awardees is anticipated during the performance of the activities. under the cooperative agreement, the nih purpose is to support and stimulate the recipients' activities by involvement in and otherwise working jointly with the award recipients in a partnership role; it is not to assume direction, prime responsibility, or a dominant role in the activities. consistent with this concept, the dominant role and prime responsibility resides with the awardees for the project as a whole, although specific tasks and activities may be shared among the awardees and the nih as defined below.the pd(s)/pi(s) will have the primary responsibility for:all data or materials generated under this u44 award and through collaborations of the pd/pi with other components of the blueprint neurotherapeutics network will be owned by the respective awardee and the data will be considered to be confidential and business privileged information of the awardee, which nevertheless does not affect its obligations to share or deliver the material or data with the government as set forth elsewhere in the grant agreement or regulations.nih staff have substantial scientific and programmatic involvement that is above and beyond the normal stewardship role in awards, as described below:an nih project collaborator will be assigned to the project, with substantial scientific and programmatic involvement that is above and beyond the normal stewardship role in awards:in addition, a program official(s) or ic program director(s) will be responsible for the normal scientific and programmatic stewardship of the award and will be named in the award notice.leadership of the institute/center funding the project will make decisions on project continuation, with input from nih staff and the external oversight committee, based on:areas of joint responsibility include:project lead development team (ldt): the ldt typically will be co-chaired by the pd/pi and an nih-contracted drug development consultant and will include additional members from the pd/pi's group, consultants and nih staff. this team will collaboratively set strategic direction and guide the work flow for the project on an ongoing basis. the ldt will meet approximately every two weeks via teleconference to analyze and interpret data from the pd/pi and contracted laboratories and to formulate the subsequent experimental plan. the ldt will propose milestones and produce progress reports for evaluation by the bpn external oversight committee and program staff as needed.if a clinical trial is performed, the ldt will be replaced by a clinical development team (cdt), which will include the pd/pi, clinical consultants and nih staff. the role and activities of the cdt during clinical development will be comparable to that of the ldt in earlier stages of the project.the members of this collaborative effort are all made aware of the requirement for confidentiality due to the intent of the awardee to pursue commercialization of any qualified outcomes. contractors and consultants of nih will be made aware of the confidential nature of work done under this collaborative effort. the handling and disposition of this confidential data and business privileged information may be covered by the trade secrets act, 18 u.s.c. section 1905.dispute resolutionany disagreements that may arise in scientific or programmatic matters (within the scope of the award) between award recipients and the nih may be brought to dispute resolution. a dispute resolution panel composed of three members will be convened. it will have three members: a designee of the external oversight committee chosen without nih staff voting, one nih designee, and a third designee with expertise in the relevant area who is chosen by the other two; in the case of individual disagreement, the first member may be chosen by the individual awardee. this special dispute resolution procedure does not alter the awardee's right to appeal an adverse action that is otherwise appealable in accordance with phs regulation 42 cfr part 50, subpart d and dhhs regulation 45 cfr part 16.data management and sharingnote: the nih policy for data management and sharing is effective for due dates on or after january 25, 2023.consistent with the nih policy for data management and sharing, when data management and sharing is applicable to the award, recipients will be required to adhere to the data management and sharing requirements as outlined in the nih grants policy statement (gps). upon the approval of a data management and sharing plan, it is required for recipients to implement the plan as described. sbir and sttr recipients may retain the rights to data generated during the performance of an sbir or sttr award for up to 20 years after the award date, per the small business innovation research (sbir) and small business technology transfer (sttr) program policy directive. an acceptable data management and sharing plan can reference and incorporate these data rights. further information about sbir and sttr data rights are enumerated in the nih gps.nih requires that sbir/sttr grantees submit the following reports within 120 days of the end of the grant budget period unless the grantee is under an extension. when multiple years are involved, awardees will be required to submit the research performance progress report (rppr) annually and financial statements as required in the nih grants policy statement.failure to submit timely final reports may affect future funding to the organization or awards with the same pd/pi.the federal funding accountability and transparency act of 2006 (transparency act), includes a requirement for awardees of federal grants to report information about first-tier subawards and executive compensation under federal assistance awards issued in fy2011 or later. all awardees of applicable nih grants and cooperative agreements are required to report to the federal subaward reporting system (fsrs) available at www.fsrs.gov on all subawards over $25,000. see the nih grants policy statement for additional information on this reporting requirement.in accordance with the regulatory requirements provided at 45 cfr 75.113 and appendix xii to 45 cfr part 75, recipients that have currently active federal grants, cooperative agreements, and procurement contracts from all federal awarding agencies with a cumulative total value greater than $10,000,000 for any period of time during the period of performance of a federal award, must report and maintain the currency of information reported in the system for award management (sam) about civil, criminal, and administrative proceedings in connection with the award or performance of a federal award that reached final disposition within the most recent five-year period. the recipient must also make semiannual disclosures regarding such proceedings. proceedings information will be made publicly available in the designated integrity and performance system (currently fapiis). this is a statutory requirement under section 872 of public law 110-417, as amended (41 u.s.c. 2313). as required by section 3010 of public law 111-212, all information posted in the designated integrity and performance system on or after april 15, 2011, except past performance reviews required for federal procurement contracts,
