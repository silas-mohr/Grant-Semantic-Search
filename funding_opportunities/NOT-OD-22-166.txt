the mission of the institutes/centers. the following nih offices may co-fund applications assigned to those institutes/centers.division of program coordination, planning and strategic initiatives, office of disease prevention (odp)sexual and gender minority research office (sgmro)this notice of special interest (nosi) solicits research, research training, and research career development on the health and well-being of people who identify as bisexual or bisexual+. “bisexual” or “bi” in this nosi may describe those with the potential to be attracted, romantically and/or sexually, to people of more than one sex or gender, not necessarily at the same time, not necessarily in the same way, and not necessarily to the same degree. “bisexual+” or “bi+” in this nosi is an umbrella term that is intended to encompass non-monosexual identities, including but not limited to bisexual, pansexual, sexually fluid, and queer.backgroundalthough in recent years there has been an overall increase in research and advances focused on the health and well-being of sexual and gender minorities (sgm; defined for the purposes of nih-supported research in not-od-19-139), not all populations that fall under the sgm umbrella have benefited equally. notably, there are relatively fewer projects related to bisexual and bisexual+ (bi/bi+) health in the nih sgm research portfolio despite bi/bi+ people accounting for the largest proportion of the population of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, intersex, and other sgm (lgbtqi+) individuals in the u.s. as of 2022 (lgbt identification in u.s. ticks up to 7.1%, gallup, 2022). nih recognized the current paucity of work specific to bi/bi+ persons in the nih fy 2021– 2025 strategic plan to advance research on the health and well-being of sexual & gender minorities and urged increased consideration and inclusion of bi/bi+ populations in research.in september 2019, nih held the bisexual health research workshop in an effort to better define the health needs and disparities of bi/bi+ people and identify research opportunities to help advance the health and well-being of members of the bi/bi+ community. the workshop focused on four key areas of bi/bi+ health:further information about the workshop can be found on the sgmro website, including the summary document containing prioritized research opportunities for each of the aforementioned key areas.research objectivesthis nosi is specifically intended to stimulate investigation into the biomedical, clinical, behavioral, and social processes that affect the health and welfare of bi/bi+ individuals, and the development of acceptable, appropriate, and relevant interventions, preventive strategies, and service delivery methods. applicants are encouraged to address one or more of the key areas highlighted in the bisexual health research workshop in their submissions. examples of research topics which are responsive to this notice include, but are not limited to:data harmonizationthe nih encourages the usage of common data elements (cdes) and other standardized measurement protocols whenever feasible in research studies to strengthen data consistency, usability, and interoperability. cdes and protocols for capturing bi/bi+ identity and other identities, social determinants of health, and other relevant topics can be found, for example, in the all of us research program data set and nih cde repository. the sgmro site features a webpage with examples of questions used in national surveys related to various dimensions of sexual orientation that may be helpful for harmonization with these data sets.of relevance, the national academies of sciences, engineering, and medicine (nasem) published a consensus report in 2022 entitled measuring sex, gender identity, and sexual orientation which presents evidence-based recommended measures to assess sexual orientation identity and associated research recommendations for consideration by applicants to this nosi. the report also offers specific measures for gender identity (comprised of sex assigned at birth and current gender in a two-step question that allows for passive identification of transgender experience) and intersex characteristics/differences in sex development (dsds), as well as associated research recommendations which may be pertinent to investigators interested in capturing and/or evaluating a broader range of aspects of sgm status and experience in addition to bi/bi+ identity.ic-specific application and submission informationapplicants should select the most appropriate ic and funding opportunity announcement (foa) to which to submit their application using the ic-specific research interests and foa listing provided in this section of the nosi. applications must fall within the mission of the ic and the requirements of the foa selected for submission. dpcpsi offices may consider co-funding meritorious applications depending on the alignment with office-specific missions and priorities and the availability of funds.ic research interestsinvestigators are strongly encouraged to reach out to the relevant scientific contacts listed in the inquiries section of this nosi to determine whether their proposed research is suitable for the ic to which the proposal is submitted.national center for complementary and integrative health (nccih)nccih is interested in supporting research on the use of complementary and integrative health approaches, including natural products and mind and body interventions, to manage stress, chronic pain, mild anxiety, or depression among bisexual or bisexual+ populations. nccih is also interested in research studying mind and body approaches to improve adherence to treatment (e.g., medication assisted treatment (mat) for opioid misuse, antiretroviral therapy (art) for hiv) and prevention (e.g., pre-exposure prophylaxis (prep) for hiv) regimens to promote health outcomes. natural products include botanicals, pre/probiotics, and products marketed as dietary supplements. mind and body approaches include various meditation approaches (e.g., mindfulness), hypnosis or guided imagery, meditative movement approaches (e.g., yoga, tai chi, qi-gong), body-based approaches (e.g., spinal manipulation, massage, mobilization, acupuncture), a combination of these approaches (e.g., meditation and yoga, such as in mindfulness-based stress reduction mbsr), or complex interventions including music and art therapy. nccih offers a range of funding opportunity announcements to support clinical trials of natural products and mind and body interventions. applicants are strongly encouraged to consult with the nccih scientific research contact prior to developing and submitting an application. please reference not-at-20-001 for guidance on nccih clinical trials policies.national institute on aging (nia)nia is interested in research that takes a life course approach to the study of bisexuality, studies that focus on and address health inequities and health disparities, and bi/bi+ research that is related to alzheimer’s disease and related dementias.national institute on alcohol abuse and alcoholism (niaaa)niaaa seeks innovative applications in the areas of:national institute of allergy and infectious diseases (niaid)areas of programmatic interest to niaid include, but are not limited to, the following:eunice kennedy shriver national institute of child health and human development (nichd)the nichd mission is to lead research and training to understand human development, improve reproductive health, enhance the lives of children and adolescents, and optimize abilities for all. the nichd's broad and diverse research portfolio includes research related to conception and pregnancy; typical and atypical development in childhood; childhood trauma, injury, and critical illness; the transition from adolescence to adulthood; reproductive health; rehabilitation; intellectual, developmental, and physical disabilities; and population dynamics across the lifespan.for this nosi, nichd seeks applications on bi/bi+ health that utilize a life course approach to investigate bi/bi+ youth and young adult development; bullying, violence, and pediatric and trauma-informed care among bi/bi+ youth; and the sexual, reproductive, and pregnancy-related health of bi/bi+ people. nichd especially welcomes projects using population representative samples to examine disparities in development and reproductive health between bi/bi+ and heterosexual, gay, or lesbian people, and the intersectional impact of bi/bi+ identities with other identities in nih-designated health disparities populations and/or among persons with disabilities. nichd is also interested in research within nichd’s scientific priorities that revisits past studies in which bi/bi+ individuals were grouped with lesbian or gay people. broad areas of inquiry could include, but are not limited to:national institute on drug abuse (nida)nida is interested in research aimed at the prevention and treatment of substance abuse disorders in all populations, including individuals who identify as bi/bi+. while members of lgbtq communities face increased risk for substance abuse relative to their heterosexual counterparts, studies have shown that bi/bi+ individuals are at even greater risk when compared to gay individuals.as a result, areas of programmatic interest to nida include, but are not limited to:national institute of dental and craniofacial research (nidcr)areas of programmatic interest to nidcr include, but are not limited to:national institute of mental health (nimh)nimh encourages research on bi/bi+ populations consistent with institute priorities. examples of projects of interest to nimh by nimh division include, but are not limited to:division of services and intervention researchdivision of aids researchnational institute on minority health and health disparities (nimhd)the mission of nimhd is to lead scientific research to improve minority health and reduce health disparities. populations that experience health disparities include african americans/blacks, hispanics/latinos, american indians, alaska natives, asians, native hawaiians and other pacific islanders, socioeconomically disadvantaged populations, underserved rural populations, and sgm populations. in the context of this foa, nimhd is especially interested in approaches that utilize the nimhd research framework to understand and examine health and healthcare access and utilization across multiple domains (i.e., biological, behavioral, environmental, systemic) and levels of influence (i.e., individual, community, societal) among bi/bi+ people.examples of potential topic areas include, but are not limited to:national institute of neurological disorders and stroke (ninds)ninds is interested in mission-relevant applications. ninds is interested in funding applications that enrich scientific understanding of how sexual orientation, gender identity, and/or being born with differences/disorders in sex development (dsds) or intersex characteristics relate to health outcomes, health risks, health behaviors, perceptions and expectations about health, and access to health-related services or associated barriers as they pertain to the ninds mission. the ninds supports basic, clinical, translational, and implementation research focused on identifying, monitoring, and targeting biological, environmental, social, community, structural, and healthcare system factors that lead to or are associated with disparities (or inequities) in neurological diseases and care across the lifespan. some priority disease areas include stroke and other cerebrovascular diseases, alzheimer’s disease-related dementias (including frontotemporal neurodegeneration, lewy body dementias, vascular contributions to cognitive impairment and dementia and mixed etiology dementia), epilepsy, migraine, nervous system infections, spinal cord injury, headache, parkinson's disease, and other neurodegenerative disorders, brain trauma, neurodevelopmental disorders, and the neurological consequences of hiv/aids. observational studies should be health equity theory-based to enable the future development of actionable, scalable, and evidence-based interventions. applicants are encouraged to incorporate community-engaged research strategies into their study designs. research activities outside of the ninds mission, or traditionally supported by another nih institute or center, will not be considered through this program. a letter of intent and communication with ninds program staff prior to submission of an application is strongly encouraged.eligible
