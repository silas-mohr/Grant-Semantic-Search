program (parent r03 clinical trial not allowed)national institute on drug abuse (nida)the purpose of this notice is to inform potential applications to the national institute on drug abuse (nida) of special interest in grant applications to conduct rigorous health services and economic research to maximize the availability and delivery of efficient, effective drug, alcohol, and tobacco treatment and recovery support services. examples of such research include: (1) clinical quality improvement; (2) quality improvement in services organization and management; (3) implementation science; (4) availability, demand, access, and financing; (5) effectiveness; and (6) development or improvement of research methodology, analytic approaches, and measurement instrumentation.backgroundalthough efficacious addiction treatment approaches exist, too few patients with drug, alcohol, and tobacco use disorders receive such services delivered with fidelity in a timely manner or for a sufficient duration. at the same time, clinical, administrative, and financing policies and practices are constantly changing and have been deployed without a sufficient evidence base, often resulting in barriers to high-quality care. as addiction treatment expands into additional settings, research is needed to promote the availability of effective treatment when and where patients need it, for as long as they need it.research objectivesnida seeks research on rigorous hypothesis-driven and theory-based study designs and data analytic methods that will support a new generation of patient centered addiction health services research. this nosi encourages, but is not limited to, applications in the following areas:clinical quality improvement studies to examine factors that may improve the appropriateness, effectiveness, safety, and efficiency of treatment and recovery interventions, either in-person or remotely, in a variety of settings including substance abuse and mental health treatment programs, pharmacies, schools, general health care settings, recovery residences, criminal and juvenile justice systems, child welfare systems and social service agencies.studies that examine personalized therapies or that use adaptive designs to tailor services to individual patients, including patients from diverse and underserved communities, are especially encouraged.quality improvement studies in services organization and management studies that address organizational contexts and service delivery models, the interaction of providers and programs within and across systems, and at multiple levels (e.g., program, practice network, state), and their collective impact on the quality of service delivery.research to better understand or improve the capacity of an sud services workforce capable of delivering high quality interventions by addressing modifiable structural factors.implementation science studies that seek to identify effective strategies for enhancing the adoption, adaptation, and sustainment of evidence-based treatment and recovery practices. studies that examine causal models of implementation success or failure are especially encouraged.research on service delivery models and other studies that address the scalability and sustainability of services that deliver evidence-based care.studies that address how to enhance equitable access to and retention in evidence-based interventions for populations that have historically experienced barriers to evidence-based care.studies that adapt existing evidence-based practices to address patient- or provider-perspectives that may limit retention in care, scalability of interventions, sustainability, fidelity to evidence-based models, or other barriers to implementation success.efficacy and effectiveness research on recovery support and harm reduction interventions and associated service delivery models, including research to address training, retention, and impacts on peer recovery workers. research on other emerging workforce models for delivering recovery support and other services at scale is also encouraged.studies examining the effects of practice and policy changes on service quality and outcomes, including unintended consequences.economic studies falling within nih’s priorities for health economics research as described in?not-od-16-025.studies developing or applying new methods and analytic approaches, including data science and health information technologies, to improve reach, efficiency, and effectiveness of health services research, including a focus on sud prediction and identification, evidence-treatment delivery, and treatment retention.application and submission informationthis notice applies to due dates on or after february 5, 2023 and
