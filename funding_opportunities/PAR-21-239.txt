dates applystandard dates applystandard dates applynot applicablethere are several options available to submit your application through grants.gov to nih and department of health and human services partners. you must use one of these submission options to access the application forms for this opportunity.we encourage inquiries concerning this funding opportunity and welcome the opportunity to answer questions from potential applicants.the overall goal of the nih research career development program is to help ensure that a diverse pool of highly trained scientists is available in appropriate scientific disciplines to address the nation's biomedical, behavioral, and clinical research needs. nih institutes and centers (ics) support a variety of mentored and non-mentored career development award programs designed to foster the transition of new investigators to research independence and to support established investigators in achieving specific objectives. candidates should review the different career development (k) award programs to determine the best program to support their goals. more information about career programs may be found at the nih extramural training mechanisms website.the objective of the career transition award (k22) is to provide support to outstanding, newly trained basic or clinical investigators to develop their research skills through a two phase program: an initial period involving an intramural position at the nih and a subsequent period of support at an extramural institution.the national institutes of health (nih) believes that the creativity and innovation of independent investigators at all career stages play an integral role in addressing our nation's biomedical, behavioral, and clinical research needs. the intent of the nimh career transition program is to assist investigators in the nimh division of intramural research programs (irp) in achieving their research career goals. the specific goals of this program are to: 1) support tenure-track scientists conducting research in the nimh irp who aim to transition to independent research positions in the extramural community where they intend to continue already successful biomedical research careers as independent scientists; and 2) foster the further career advancement of these independent scientists and enable them to expand their potential to contribute significantly to mental health-related research.in order to maintain and expand on the many contributions of irp investigators to mental health research and to strengthen further the innovative research that is conducted in the irp, the nimh irp must maintain a steady turnover of tenure-track investigators. in seeking to attract outstanding, early-stage scientific talent to the nimh irp, there is a need to maintain a steady flow of irp investigators to the extramural community. to foster and aid that transition, the nimh career transition program will provide fiscal support for up to three years to enable tenure-track investigators in the irp to transition their research programs to the extramural community. this program should enable tenure-track intramural investigators to compete successfully for academic positions, make successful career changes, and compete for r01 or r01-like research grant support from the nih and other agencies.nature of the career/research transition opportunityeach application to the nimh career transition (k22) program must reflect the individual needs of the candidate (pd/pi). the k22 award is conducted in two phases: phase 1 takes place at the nimh irp while phase 2 takes place at the domestic, extramural institution to which the candidate will transition.the application will be submitted for peer review of scientific and technical merit while the candidate is a tenure-track investigator in the nimh irp. the research proposed must span both phases of the award. the outcome of this review will be a key determinant of whether the application will be supported. however, it is the phase 2 application that will be awarded. if the candidate receives a meritorious score after peer review of the initial application, the candidate will be notified in writing of nimh's initial commitment to make an award. the candidate will then have a period of no more than 18 months (phase 1) to identify a suitable, independent research position at a domestic research institution/organization and negotiate a start-up package while continuing their independent research program in the irp. as soon as negotiations between the candidate and the institution are complete, the phase 2 application must be submitted by the extramural institution for administrative review and award (see below).phase 2 of the nimh career transition (k22) award will provide up to three years of support to conduct research as an independent scientist at a domestic, extramural institution/organization to which the candidate has been recruited, been offered and has accepted an independent research position. the institution sponsoring the phase 2 award must demonstrate a commitment to provide the environment, resources, and at least 6 person-months (equivalent to 50% full-time professional effort) of protected time during the phase 2 award period for the candidate to conduct the proposed research. this commitment will enable the candidate to maintain and develop further an independent research program and to prepare a competitive application for research grant support (r01) during the k22 award period. nimh k22 award recipients are expected to apply for nih or other independent research grant support during the second year of the extramural phase (phase 2) of the k22 award.the nimh career transition (k22) application allows the project to be peer reviewed for scientific and technical merit (phase 1) before the candidate begins an independent research position at an extramural institution (phase 2). phase 2 funding is not automatic and is subject to several conditions described in section vi. transition to phase 2. once the independent research position has been secured, nimh will administratively review the phase 2 application to ensure that all programmatic requirements are met prior to award.candidates are encouraged to consult with the appropriate staff person in section vii - agency contacts, prior to submitting an application, to discuss eligibility and program requirements.note: this funding opportunity announcement (foa) is designed specifically for applicants proposing research that does not involve leading an independent clinical trial, a clinical trial feasibility study, or an ancillary clinical trial.see section viii. other information for award authorities and regulations.grant: a support mechanism providing money, property, or both to an eligible entity to carry out an approved project or activity.the oer glossary and the sf424 (r&r) application guide provide details on these application types.note: applicants should not submit proposals for a clinical trial experience.need help determining whether you are doing a clinical trial?the number of awards is contingent upon nih appropriations and the submission of a sufficient number of meritorious applicationsthe total project period may not exceed 3 years.nimh will contribute funds for up to 6 person-months' effort per year toward the salary of the career award recipient during phase 2 of the award. the funds for salary and fringe benefits are included within the annual, direct cost cap of $300,000 for the nimh career transition award (k22) program. the total nih contribution to salary, however, may not exceed the legislatively mandated salary cap. see: http://grants.nih.gov/grants/policy/salcap_summary.htm.nimh will contribute $300,000 per year toward the research development costs of the award recipient, which must be justified and consistent with the stage of development of the candidate and the proportion of time to be spent in research or career development activities.salary for mentors, secretarial and administrative assistants, etc. is not allowed.eligible applicant organizations for phase 1:eligible applicant organizations for phase 2:the following types of higher education institutions are always encouraged to apply for nih support as public or private institutions of higher education:nonprofits other than institutions of higher educationfor-profit organizationsthe application for the extramural phase (phase 2) of the award will be submitted by the domestic, for-profit or non-profit, academic institution/organization (e.g. university, college, hospital, and laboratory) at which the candidate has been recruited, offered and has accepted an independent research faculty position. eligibility of organizations, other than institutions of higher education, for phase 2 depends on the nature of the appointment, and the ability of the pd/pi to conduct independent research and apply for nih research (r01 or r01-equivalent) grants. only successful phase 1 candidates may proceed to phase 2.applicant organizationsapplicant organizations must complete and maintain the following registrations as described in the sf 424 (r&r) application guide to be eligible to apply for or receive an award. all registrations must be completed prior to the application being submitted. registration can take 6 weeks or more, so applicants should begin the registration process as soon as possible. the nih policy on late submission of grant applications states that failure to complete registrations in advance of a due date is not a valid reason for a late submission.program directors/principal investigators (pd(s)/pi(s))all pd(s)/pi(s) must have an era commons account. pd(s)/pi(s) should work with their organizational officials to either create a new account or to affiliate their existing account with the applicant organization in era commons. if the pd/pi is also the organizational signing official, they must have two distinct era commons accounts, one for each role. obtaining an era commons account can take up to 2 weeks.any candidate with the skills, knowledge, and resources necessary to carry out the proposed research as the program director/principal investigator (pd/pi) is invited to work with his/her organization to develop an application for support. individuals from underrepresented racial and ethnic groups as well as individuals with disabilities are always encouraged to apply for nih support. multiple pds/pis are not allowed.by the time of award, the individual must be a citizen or a non-citizen national of the united states or have been lawfully admitted for permanent residence (i.e., possess a currently valid permanent resident card uscis form i-551, or other legal verification of such status).at the time an application is submitted (or resubmitted) for peer review, the pd/pi must currently be conducting research in the nimh irp and must have been a tenure-track investigator in the nimh irp for at least five years. at the time an application is submitted (or resubmitted), individuals are not eligible to apply if they are negotiating and/or have accepted an independent faculty position, or its equivalent, in academia, industry, or elsewhere.candidates for the k22 award must have a clinical or research doctorate (including phd, md, do, dc, nd, dds, dvm, scd, dns, pharmd, or equivalent doctoral degree), or a combined clinical and research doctoral degree.applicant organizations may submit more than one application, provided that each application is scientifically distinct, and each is from a different candidate.the nih will not accept duplicate or highly overlapping applications under review at the same time. an individual may not have two or more competing nih career development applications pending review concurrently. in addition, nih will not accept:phase 2 k22 award recipients are encouraged to obtain funding from nih or other federal sources either as a pd/pi on a competing research grant award or cooperative agreement, or as project leader on a competing multi-project award as described in not-od-08-065.at the time of the phase 2 award, the candidate must have a “full-time” appointment at the academic institution. phase 2 awardees are required to commit a minimum of 50% of full-time professional effort (i.e., a minimum of 6 person-months) to their mental-health research. candidates may engage in other duties as part of the remaining 50% of their full-time professional effort not covered by this award, as long as such duties do not interfere with or detract from the proposed career development program.candidates who have va appointments may not consider part of the va effort toward satisfying the full time requirement at the applicant institution. candidates with va appointments should contact the staff person in the relevant institute or center prior to preparing an application to discuss their eligibility.after the receipt of the award, adjustments to the required level of effort may be made in certain circumstances. see not-od-09-036 for more details.both phase 1 and phase 2 applicant institutions must have strong, well-established records of research and career development activities and faculty

contains information about key dates and times. applicants are encouraged to submit applications before the due date to ensure they have time to make any application corrections that might be necessary for successful submission. when a submission date falls on a weekend or federal holiday, the application deadline is automatically extended to the next business day.organizations must submit applications to grants.gov (the online portal to find and apply for grants across all federal agencies) using assist or other electronic submission systems. applicants must then complete the submission process by tracking the status of the application in the era commons, nih’s electronic system for grants administration. nih and grants.gov systems check the application against many of the application instructions upon submission. errors must be corrected and a changed/corrected application must be submitted to grants.gov on or before the application due date and time. if a changed/corrected application is submitted after the deadline, the application will be considered late. applications that miss the due date and time are subjected to the nih policy on late application submission.applicants are responsible for viewing their application before the due date in the era commons to ensure accurate and successful submission.information on the submission process and a definition of on-time submission are provided in the sf424 (r&r) application guide.all nih awards are subject to the terms and conditions, cost principles, and other considerations described in the nih grants policy statement.pre-award costs are allowable only as described in the nih grants policy statement.generally phase 1 is for 18 months; however, award recipients may transition earlier than 18 months when the recipient has been offered an acceptable position. it is expected that award recipients will generally benefit from a phase 1 period of no less than 12 months in duration before transitioning to phase 2. if an applicant is negotiating and/or has accepted an independent faculty position, or its equivalent, in academia, industry, or elsewhere prior to notification of the institute’s intent to make a k22 award, then no award will be made.award recipients are expected to apply for nih or other independent research grant support during year 2 of the phase 2 k22 award.

center for scientific review, nih. applications that are incomplete or non-compliant will not be reviewed.use of common data elements in nih-funded researchnih encourages the use of common data elements (cdes) in basic, clinical, and applied research, patient registries, and other human subject research to facilitate broader and more effective use of data and advance research across studies. cdes are data elements that have been identified and defined for use in multiple data sets across different studies. use of cdes can facilitate data sharing and standardization to improve data quality and enable data integration from multiple studies and sources, including electronic health records. nih ics have identified cdes for many clinical domains (e.g., neurological disease), types of studies (e.g., genome-wide association studies (gwas)), types of outcomes (e.g., patient-reported outcomes), and patient registries (e.g., the global rare diseases patient registry and data repository). nih has established a “common data element (cde) resource portal" (http://cde.nih.gov/) to assist investigators in identifying nih-supported cdes when developing protocols, case report forms, and other instruments for data collection. the portal provides guidance about and access to nih-supported cde initiatives and other tools and resources for the appropriate use of cdes and data standards in nih-funded research. investigators are encouraged to consult the portal and describe in their applications any use they will make of nih-supported cdes in their projects.applicants are required to follow the instructions for post-submission materials, as described in the policy. any instructions provided here are in addition to the instructions in the policy.note: effective for due dates on or after january 25, 2023, the data sharing plan and genomic data sharing plan (gds) as part of the resource sharing plan will not be evaluated at time of review.only the review criteria described below will be considered in the review process. applications submitted to the nih in support of the nih mission are evaluated for scientific and technical merit through the nih peer review system.for this particular announcement, note the following: the goal of this nimh career transition (k22) award program is to facilitate the transition of a tenure-track intramural investigator from the nimh irp (phase 1) to an extramural research faculty position (phase 2). the first year of the phase 2 award at the extramural institution is likely to include time to establish the new laboratory and to recruit, hire and train personnel.reviewers should evaluate the candidate’s potential for developing an independent research program that will make important contributions to the field, taking into consideration the years of research experience and the likely value of the proposed research career development as a vehicle for developing a successful, independent research program.reviewers should provide their assessment of the likelihood that the proposed career development and research plan will enhance the candidate’s potential for a productive, independent scientific research career in a health-related field, taking into consideration the criteria below in determining the overall impact score.reviewers will consider each of the review criteria below in the determination of scientific merit, and give a separate score for each. an application does not need to be strong in all categories to be judged likely to have major scientific impact.candidatecareer development

recognizes that research projects are often limited in scope for many reasons that are nondiscriminatory, such as the principal investigator’s scientific interest, funding limitations, recruitment requirements, and other considerations. thus, criteria in research protocols that target or exclude certain populations are warranted where nondiscriminatory justifications establish that such criteria are appropriate with respect to the health or safety of the subjects, the scientific study design, or the purpose of the research. for additional guidance regarding how the provisions apply

the statutory provisions contained in section 872 of the duncan hunter national defense authorization act of fiscal year 2009 (public law 110-417), nih awards will be subject to thefederal awardee performance and integrity information system (fapiis) requirements. fapiis requires federal award making officials to review and consider information about an applicant in the designated integrity and performance system (currently fapiis) prior to making an award. an applicant, at its option, may review information in the designated integrity and performance systems accessible through fapiis and comment on any information about itself that a federal agency previously entered and is currently in fapiis. the federal awarding agency will consider any comments by the applicant, in addition to other information in fapiis, in making a judgement about the applicant’s integrity, business ethics, and record of performance under federal awards when completing the review of risk posed by applicants as described in 45 cfr part 75.205 “federal awarding agency review of risk posed by applicants.” this provision will apply to all nih grants and cooperative agreements except fellowships.transition to the independent phasetransition to phase 2transition from the intramural phase (phase 1) to the extramural phase (phase 2) is intended to be continuous in time. support for phase 2 is not automatic and is contingent upon obtaining an appropriate extramural position at an eligible institution, an appropriate start-up package, and the successful nimh programmatic review of the faculty position the candidate has accepted and the institutional commitment to the candidate. from the date of the approval letter transmitted to the candidate, the candidate has a period of no more than 18 months (phase 1) to identify a suitable, independent research faculty position at an eligible, domestic research institution/organization, negotiate a start-up package, and accept a position. generally phase 1 is for 18 months; however, award recipients may transition earlier than 18 months when the recipient has been offered an acceptable position. it is expected that award recipients will generally benefit from a phase 1 period of no less than 12 months in duration before transitioning to phase 2. if an applicant is negotiating and/or has accepted an independent faculty position, or its equivalent, in academic, industry, or elsewhere prior to notification of the institute’s intent to make a phase 1 k22 award, then no phase 2 award will be made. in order to submit a phase 2 application, an individual must have been offered and accepted a research faculty position at an eligible institution that has both appropriate infrastructure to support the proposed research program and a history of external research funding.to avoid potential problems, candidates are strongly encouraged to contact their nimh program official as soon as plans to accept an extramural position develop. at that time, individuals should discuss plans for transition to, and the application for, the phase 2 award. the application for the phase 2 award should be submitted no later than 2 months prior to the proposed start date of the phase 2 award.the phase 2 institution will submit an application on behalf of the candidate using the phs398 application. the application must include:letter of institutional commitment: a letter of institutional commitment is required at the time of the phase 2 application and is typically provided by the department or division chairperson. this letter should satisfy the criteria described in the career development award section of the sf424 (r&r) application guide. the letter should describe the following:nimh staff may review start-up packages and other commitments between the institution and candidate. the applicant and/or the hiring institution are encouraged to discuss the nature of the institutional commitment with the nimh program official prior to finalizing the offer and submission of the k22 application. nimh will not make a phase 2 k22 award if the institutional commitment is deemed inadequate.applicants who are approved to transition will receive a notice of award reflecting the dollar amount and the recipient organization. candidates who are not approved to transition will receive written notification from the nimh communicating the rationale for the disapproval. this notification typically will be transmitted within 60 days of receipt of the phase 2 application.data management and sharingnote: the nih
