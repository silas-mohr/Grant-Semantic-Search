october 7, 2023all applications are due by 5:00 pm local time of applicant organization.applicants are encouraged to apply early to allow adequate time to make any corrections to errors found in the application during the submission process by the due date.no late applications will be accepted for this notice of funding opportunity.not applicableit is critical that applicants follow the multi-project (m) instructions in the sf424 (r&r) application guide, except where instructed to do otherwise (in this nofo or in a notice from the nih guide for grants and contracts). conformance to all requirements (both in the application guide and the nofo) is required and strictly enforced. applicants must read and follow all application instructions in the application guide as well as any program-specific instructions noted in section iv. when the program-specific instructions deviate from those in the application guide, follow the program-specific instructions. applications that do not comply with these instructions may be delayed or not accepted for review.there are several options available to submit your application through grants.gov to nih and department of health and human services partners. you must use one of these submission options to access the application forms for this opportunity.purposea changing climate will adversely impact human health through multiple direct and indirect effects on individuals and their communities. the purpose of this notice of funding opportunity (nofo) is to solicit p20 planning grant applications for climate change and health research centers (cchrcs). this program will support the development of an innovative research environment to foster and sustain a transdisciplinary program of fundamental and applied research to explore the complex impacts of climate change on health and to develop action-oriented strategies that protect health and build resiliency at the individual, community, national and global levels. a major goal for this program is to build research teams as well as collaborations with communities and other key partners. the program seeks innovative research and pilot/feasibility projects that utilize transdisciplinary approaches to address questions relevant to climate change impacts on health. applications for these cchrcs should propose planning and development activities in preparation to build institutional research capacity for future proposals addressing climate and health. nih seeks to support a variety of these centers around the world and across a range of thematic scientific areas in support of the four core elements of the nih’s investment in climate health research: health effects research, health equity, intervention research, and training and capacity building. each cchrc is expected to: (1) plan and develop sustainable research capacity by establishing centralized resources and research infrastructure; (2) develop the center’s thematic science area through transdisciplinary research activities; (3) enable research that will develop into new programs of science and research applications supporting independent investigators; (4) establish or build upon and maintain authentic partnerships to engage communities most likely to be impacted by climate change in all phases of the research process; and (5) actively participate in the nih research coordinating center to support climate change and health community of practice activities (https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/rfa-files/rfa-es-22-003.html).backgroundnih’s broad scientific scope uniquely positions the agency to understand and help address the complex set of factors that interact to create acute and chronic health burdens linked to climate change. climate drivers affect health outcomes directly through weather events such as extreme heat or cold, wildfires, droughts, storm surges, and floods, but also indirectly through exposure pathways such as air and water quality, food quality, infectious diseases, and massive population displacement events. these pathways are themselves influenced by environmental contexts related to land use, geography, infrastructure, and agriculture, as well as social, cultural, behavioral, and economic contexts that create vulnerabilities associated with life stage, gender, poverty, housing quality, discrimination, access to care, and other social determinants of health (sdoh).climate change is greatly expanding and modifying the landscape of threats to human health across a wide range of illnesses and injuries, including: asthma, respiratory allergies and airway diseases, cancers, cardiovascular disease and stroke, foodborne diseases and decreased nutrition, heat-related illness and deaths, reproductive and birth outcomes, and developmental effects, mental health conditions and neurological disorders, vector-borne and zoonotic diseases, waterborne diseases, and extreme weather-related morbidity and mortality. as with many diseases and disorders, populations including children, older adults, women and pregnant women, and persons with disabilities, among others, may be disproportionally at risk. strong evidence indicates that climate change also disproportionately adversely affects communities that experience socioeconomic, behavioral, and environmental vulnerabilities. such communities include populations that experience health disparities, especially racial and ethnic minority communities; high-poverty urban, rural, and tribal communities; military and veteran populations; and those unduly burdened by exposure to environmental pollution (www.nimhd.nih.gov/about/overview). in the global community, these same populations, as well as those living in extreme poverty and with poor access to health and economic services, are at a higher risk of experiencing health impacts of climate change.most climate change and health research has been focused on documenting and understanding these emerging threats to populations around the world. a more recent area of research explores how climate adaptation efforts can reduce health hazards. adaptation refers to a diverse array of institutional, environmental, and technological interventions, including urban planning, housing, transportation, air quality management, improved water systems, flood control, vector control, and changes in health services, among others. importantly, other research has demonstrated opportunities for health co-benefits from system changes to mitigate climate change, including healthy buildings, improved agricultural practices, and nutritional security. a complementary field of study is focused on health threats posed by potential unintended side effects of actions by energy, agriculture, transportation, health care, and other sectors to mitigate climate change and protect enterprises from losses due to extreme weather or gradually changing conditions. these actions create “natural experiments” that are important in understanding how negative consequences can be avoided and health benefits maximized.considering the complexity of the issues to be addressed, including the recognition that many groups of individuals will be disproportionately impacted because of climate change and related events, applications submitted in response to this nofo should propose innovative transdisciplinary approaches in support of a center structured around two or more of these four core elements. (https://www.nih.gov/sites/default/files/research-training/initiatives/climate-change/nih-climate-change-framework.pdf)key definitions for the nofo:climate change: climate change is a long-term change in the average weather patterns that have come to define earth’s local, regional, and global climates. these changes have a broad range of observed effects including, but not limited to, global land and ocean temperature increases; rising sea levels; ice loss at earth’s poles and in mountain glaciers; frequency and severity changes in extreme weather such as hurricanes, heatwaves, wildfires, droughts, floods, and precipitation; and cloud and vegetation cover changes.transdisciplinary: research efforts conducted by investigators from different disciplines working jointly to create new conceptual, theoretical, methodological, and translational innovations that integrate and move beyond discipline-specific approaches to address a common problem.health disparities populations: racial and ethnic minorities (black or african american, hispanic or latino, american indian and alaska native, asian, or native hawaiian and pacific islander persons), socioeconomically disadvantaged populations, underserved rural populations, and sexual and gender minorities in the u.s. and comparable populations globally. for more information: https://www.nimhd.nih.gov/about/overview/social determinants of health (sdoh): social determinants of health (sdoh) are the conditions in the environments where people are born, live, learn, work, play, worship, and age that affect a wide range of health, functioning, and quality of life outcomes. sdoh can be grouped into five domains that include: economic stability, education access and quality, health care access and quality, neighborhood and built environment, social and community context. for a complete definition: https://health.gov/healthypeople/objectives-and-data/social-determinants-health. additional resource: https://www.phenxtoolkit.org/collections/view/6research objectivesthe cchrcs will propose activities to establish the research infrastructure necessary to foster and conduct transdisciplinary science that addresses a specific thematic topic of climate and health research that will advance the field towards solutions-oriented adaptation and implementation that takes into consideration the core elements described above. centers may consider exploring areas of research that address gaps in knowledge or feasibility of adaptation approaches for climate change impacts on health from a local, regional, national, or global perspective.the center team will be led by established investigators and should consist of individuals from other disciplines as appropriate to the research being
