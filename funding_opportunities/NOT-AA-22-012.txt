alcohol use, sars-cov-2, and covid-19. a central focus is research that can improve public health by informing responses to the evolving covid-19 pandemic and its consequences.backgroundto date, an association between alcohol use disorder (aud), especially recently diagnosed aud, and an increased risk of sars-cov-2 infection has been found in some, but not other, large cohort studies. in addition, an association between aud and an increased risk of developing severe covid-19 disease outcomes has been found in majority of large cohort studies. an association between alcohol associated liver disease and severe covid-19 disease outcomes has also been found in some, but not other, large cohort studies.alcohol and covid-19 have multifaceted interactions arising from biological, behavioral, and psychosocial factors. data from survey studies and alcohol sales suggest that alcohol consumption increased during the pandemic, with some studies finding larger increases for people with pre-existing or pandemic-related anxiety and depression. acute consumption of alcohol contributes to impulsivity and risk-taking and could lead to reductions in social distancing and compliance with mask mandates. public settings in which alcohol is consumed may pose particular hazards for virus transmission. physical distancing requirements aimed at reducing spread of the virus impacted the provision of services across the continuum of care, from screening to treatment and recovery support.alcohol misuse interferes with systemic and organ immune function and has been shown to elevate susceptibility to numerous pathogens. in particular, long-term excessive alcohol misuse reduces the barrier function of the respiratory tract and impairs the capacity of lung-specific immune cells to mobilize a defense, making it easier for respiratory infections to develop. in addition, alcohol misuse is associated with increased risk of developing acute respiratory distress syndrome (ards). alcohol misuse also disrupts neuroimmune interactions and is associated with neuroinflammation. binge drinking and chronic excessive alcohol use are associated with elevated markers of inflammation throughout the body and an impaired immune response to pathogens. these and other effects of alcohol misuse have the potential to impact the transmission and severity of sars-cov-2 infections and therefore present a range of important research needs and opportunities.the impact of excessive alcohol consumption on biology and behavior could complicate the physical and mental health outcomes of covid-19 infections.the long-lasting impact of sars-cov-2 infection on physical, cognitive, and mental health has emerged as a new challenge of the pandemic. post-acute sequelae of covid-19 (pasc) appears to arise from the extended effects of sars- cov-2 infection and its consequences on multiple organs and the central nervous system, beyond the initial infection by sars-cov-2. it remains to be determined whether and how alcohol misuse interacts with or contributes to post-acute sequelae following acute sars-cov-2 infection.research prioritiesresearch is needed that can inform and enhance the nation’s response to the evolving covid-19 pandemic by advancing understanding of the relationships between alcohol misuse and covid-19-related outcomes. niaaa will support research on risks and outcomes associated with alcohol consumption, sars-cov-2 infection, and the covid-19 pandemic in the general population and among underserved populations, such as racial, ethnic, and sexual/gender minorities, rural populations, individuals with low socioeconomic status, and those who are incarcerated or homeless.examples of research objectives include but are not limited to those that:secondary analyses of existing covid-19- and alcohol-related datasets are encouraged where appropriate.across topic areas, applicants are strongly encouraged to use measures drawn from one or both of the nih public health emergency and disaster research response (dr2) [ https://dr2.nlm.nih.gov/ ] and the phenx toolkit [ https://www.phenxtoolkit.org/index.php ]. additionally, applications focusing on vulnerable populations, including but not limited to racial/ethnic minorities, health disparity populations, and individuals with existing medical vulnerabilities conferring increased risk for severe covid-19 infection, e.g., advanced age, obesity, hiv/aids, etc., are especially encouraged.research supported under this nosi is expected to be relevant to the united states. projects relying on data or cohorts outside of the u.s. must provide a strong justification for the relevance of the research to the u.s. context.investigators planning to submit an application in response to the nosi are strongly encouraged to contact a program officer early in the application process to discuss the proposed project.application and submission informationthis notice applies to due dates on or after june 5, 2022, and subsequent receipt dates through march 5, 2024.submit applications for this initiative using one of the following funding opportunity announcements (foas) or any reissues of these
