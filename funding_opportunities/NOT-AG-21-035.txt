december 30, 2021par-22-093 - research on current topics in alzheimer's disease and its related dementias (r01 clinical trial optional)national institute on aging (nia)purposein 2017, the national institute on aging (nia) engaged leading experts from academia, industry, and non-profit foundations working in the field of alzheimer’s disease (ad) and alzheimer's disease-related dementias (adrd) in a strategic planning process to help ensure that the next generation of alzheimer's disease research centers (adrcs) is poised to accomplish the goals of the national alzheimer’s plan. the resulting recommendations included several specific ideas centered around collaboration, including developing greater opportunities for collaborations across the adrcs, increasing interactions with other center programs, and making the resources at the adrcs available to outside investigators.as a continued and concerted effort to build and expand on these recommendations, this notice of special interest (nosi) facilitates collaborative, cross-disciplinary, and multi-institutional approaches that will contribute new and vital information and insights about normal aging and the clinical and pathological course of ad/adrd and/or that can advance the research agendas in any of the eight focus areas outlined in the ad/adrd research implementation milestones. specifically, this nosi solicits r01 applications that address its overarching objectives: 1) to promote the wider sharing and leveraging of nia’s existing ad/adrd resources by facilitating access to unique resources (such as the availability of neuropathological data on thousands of participants) and the collection and integration of new data and samples, and 2) to broaden the participation of researchers in the design, analysis, and interpretation of results from collaborative research that makes use of these unique resources to answer novel scientific questions.to further leverage nia’s existing investments in ad/adrd-relevant resources, this nosi aims to support collaboration among researchers and scientists within and outside the adrcs. findings from projects under this nosi may be used as the preliminary data for new research applications and/or lead to the standardization of ad/adrd-relevant measures or the development of methodological approaches that can advance ad/adrd research goals aligned with the ad/adrd research implementation milestones.for this nosi, nia invites applications that use ad/adrd-related resources available through nia’s adrcs, the national alzheimer's coordinating center (nacc), national centralized repository for alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ncrad), nia genetics of alzheimer’s disease data storage site (niagads), and the alzheimer's disease sequencing project (adsp), or resources generated from nih’s or nia’s other large-scale consortia, including but not limited to: model organism development and evaluation for late-onset alzheimer’s disease (model-ad), the accelerating medicines partnership® program for alzheimer's disease (amp-ad), molecular mechanisms of the vascular etiology of alzheimer's disease (m2ove-ad), and the alzheimer's disease genetics consortium. nia also encourages collaborative use of ad/adrd-related resources generated through other nih-funded centers, such as nia’s pepper centers, roybal centers, shock centers, and resource centers for minority aging research (rcmar). nia especially welcomes collaborative studies that leverage data relevant to ad/adrd from nia-supported longitudinal cohort studies (e.g., the health and retirement study (hrs) and hrs international sister studies, the national health and aging trends study, rochester epidemiology project, midlife development in the u.s. (midus), and studies participating in the integrative analysis of longitudinal studies of aging and dementia (ialsa)).application and submission informationthis notice applies to due dates on or after march 11, 2022 and subsequent receipt dates through november 13, 2024.submit applications for this initiative using the following funding opportunity announcement (foa) or any reissue of the announcement through the expiration date of this notice.all instructions in the sf424 (r&r) application guide and the funding opportunity announcement used for submission must be followed, with the following additions:applications nonresponsive to terms of this nosi will not be considered for the nosi initiative.division of neuroscience (dn) contact:cerise l. elliott, ph.d. national institute on aging (nia) telephone: 301-496-9350 email: elliottce@nih.govdivision of behavioral and social research (dbsr) contact:melissa s. gerald, ph.d. national institute on aging (nia) telephone: 301-496-3136 email: melissa.gerald@nih.govweekly toc for this announcement nih funding opportunities and noticesnote: for help accessing pdf, rtf, ms word, excel, powerpoint, audio or video files, see help downloading files.
