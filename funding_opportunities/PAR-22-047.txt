provide funding support for the pre-clinical and early stage clinical (phase i) development of novel small-molecule and biologic drug candidates that prevent alzheimer's disease (ad), slow its progression, or treat its cognitive and behavioral symptoms. participants in this program will receive funding for therapy development activities such as medicinal chemistry; pharmacokinetics (pk); absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, toxicology (admet); efficacy in animal models; formulation development; chemical synthesis under good manufacturing practices (gmp); investigational new drug (ind) enabling studies; and initial phase i clinical testing. applications not responsive to this foa include: research on basic mechanisms of disease or mechanisms of drug action; development of biomarkers, devices, non-pharmacological interventions (e.g., exercise, diet, cognitive training), repurposed drugs and combinations therapies; discovery activities such as high-throughput screening and hit optimization; and stand-alone clinical trials.30 days prior to the application due dateall applications are due by 5:00 pm local time of applicant organization. all types of non-aids applications allowed for this funding opportunity announcement are due on the listed date(s).applicants are encouraged to apply early to allow adequate time to make any corrections to errors found in the application during the submission process by the due date.not applicableit is critical that applicants follow the instructions in the research (r) instructions in the sf424 (r&r) application guide,except where instructed to do otherwise (in this foa or in a notice from nih guide for grants and contracts ).conformance to all requirements (both in the application guide and the foa) is required and strictly enforced. applicants must read and follow all application instructions in the application guide as well as any program-specific instructions noted in section iv. when the program-specific instructions deviate from those in the application guide, follow the program-specific instructions.applications that do not comply with these instructions may be delayed or not accepted for review.there are several options available to submit your application through grants.gov to nih and department of health and human services partners. you must use one of these submission options to access the application forms for this opportunity.overviewalzheimer's disease (ad) is the most common cause of dementia in older persons and is among the greatest healthcare challenges of the 21st century. the disease currently affects an estimated 5.5 million in the united states; by 2050 this number could rise as high as 14 million. to avert this public health crisis, effective therapies that prevent ad, slow its progression, or treat its cognitive and behavioral symptoms are urgently needed. to catalyze drug development for ad, nia is reissuing, with this funding opportunity announcement (foa), the alzheimer's drug development program (addp). the addp offers researchers funding for drug development activities that can be conducted in their own laboratories, in collaboration with contract research organizations (cros) that specialize in various drug development activities including: medicinal chemistry; pharmacokinetics (pk); absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, toxicology (admet); formulations development; efficacy in animal models; chemical synthesis under good manufacturing practices (gmp); investigational new drug (ind) enabling safety-toxicology; and initial phase i clinical testing.scopethe overarching goal of the addp is the development of a broad range of novel drug candidates for ad, including small molecules, natural products, and biologics against validated targets. the program is not designed to support research on basic mechanisms of disease or mechanisms of drug action; development of biomarkers, devices, non-pharmacological interventions (e.g., exercise, diet, cognitive training), repurposed drugs, and combination therapies; or activities such as high throughput screening.to maintain portfolio diversity, this program does not support projects aimed at anti-amyloid therapies and tau immunotherapies.projects can enter the addp either at the early stage to optimize the agent's potency, drug-like properties, specificity, pharmacological properties, and/or admet properties and undergo investigational new drug (ind)-enabling safety toxicology, or at the late stage to advance development of candidates through ind-enabling toxicology studies and initial phase i clinical testing.applicants are encouraged to contact nia scientific/research staff regarding the suitability of their projects for the addp and to clarify which entry stage is most appropriate for their project.stage specific entry criteriaearly stage entry criteria for small molecule projectssmall molecule

include but are not limited to the following:non-responsiveness criteria:milestonesmilestone-driven research is used to ensure research is focused on a well-defined goal and achieving that goal with the greatest efficiency. as drug development research is inherently high risk, the use of milestones provides clear indicators of a project's continued success or emergent difficulties. the milestones must provide objective and quantitative success criteria which are recognizable as appropriate endpoints for a specific scientific goal and can be used to monitor the progress made by a research project. the milestones will serve as a basis for go/no-go decision making between nia program staff and the project research team. therefore, the application must include a table or list of go/no-go milestones with quantitative success criteria for each year of funding. prior to funding of an application, nia program staff will contact the applicant to discuss the proposed milestones and any modifications to the milestones recommended by the review committee or nia program staff. a final set of approved milestones will be specified in the notice of award. progress towards achievement of the established milestones will be evaluated by a committee composed of nia program staff. if warranted, the milestones for future years may be revised based on data and research progress during the preceding year.note: if a funded project does not make satisfactory progress toward the agreed upon milestones at any stage during the funding period, future year grant funding may be discontinued.quality and compliance requirementssince one of the goals of this program is to generate drug candidates which will be eligible for fda approval, adherence to compliance and quality criteria is required.intellectual propertythe ultimate goal of this program is to bring new therapies to the market. therefore, the creation and protection of intellectual property (ip) that will make drug candidates attractive to potential licensing and commercialization partners is an important activity to be undertaken by the pd/pi in consultation with their institutions' technology transfer officials. this program is structured so that the awardee institution retains their assignment of ip and thereby controls the patent prosecution and licensing negotiations for drug candidates developed in this program. it is expected that the awardee institution will take responsibility for patent filings, maintenance, and licensing efforts toward eventual commercialization.the national institute on aging (nia) supports a central resource to nia staff and extramural investigators to facilitate/support the conduct and management of clinical research. this resource, the clinical research operations management system (croms), is a comprehensive data management system to support the business functions, management, and oversight responsibilities of nia grants that support the conduct of clinical research with human subjects. it is the expectation by nia that all successful applicants will interface, integrate, or adapt their information system(s) and processes to interact with existing and future components of the croms as necessary, including the use of a croms data templates as specified.see section viii. other information for award authorities and regulations.cooperative agreement: a support mechanism used when there will be substantial federal scientific or programmatic involvement. substantial involvement means that, after award, nih
