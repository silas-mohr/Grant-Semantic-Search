increased levels of free radicals generated by the upregulation of oxidative metabolism. the nutrients required to support an active metabolism can be imported directly from blood plasma or tumor interstitial fluid; they can also be acquired by parasitizing the surrounding tumor microenvironment. recent work has documented the contributions of both neighboring stromal cells, such as cancer associated adipocytes (caas) and cancer associated fibroblasts (cafs), and the surrounding extracellular matrix to tumor metabolism. an equally important but less well appreciated source of fuel and biosynthetic building blocks is diet, which has been shown to impact the availability of various macronutrients in the tumor microenvironment both directly and indirectly.although the association between diet and cancer risk is well established, the influence of diet on tumor growth and progression is less understood. this is due partly to the challenges of defining and controlling dietary variables in patient populations, and partly to the complexity of the tumor microenvironment, which may buffer subtle changes in the concentration of some metabolites. different dietary patterns may also have different effects depending on the tissue from which the tumor originates. for example, a high fat diet has been linked to worse outcomes for breast, colorectal, and prostate cancer patients. in support of this epidemiological evidence, studies in mouse models have found that a high fat diet significantly alters the levels of a subset of serum metabolites, and may promote tumor growth and angiogenesis even in the absence of weight gain. in contrast, a lower carbohydrate diet with a higher fat content, particularly plant-based fats, is associated with longer survival times in some prospective studies of pancreatic cancer patients.recent work has suggested that lipid metabolism plays a central role in connecting diet and tumor growth and progression, both by promoting cellular proliferation and by regulating anti-tumor immunity. lipids are a structurally diverse class of macromolecule that play a variety of biological roles; they can act as signaling molecules, be oxidized to provide energy in the form of atp, or serve as the physical building blocks of cellular membranes. lipid metabolism is highly plastic, and is commonly deregulated in cancer cells. multiple different dietary perturbations have now been reported to directly influence lipid metabolism in tumors. for example, in mouse models of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma or non-small cell lung carcinoma, caloric restriction impairs the activity of stearoyl-coa desaturase (scd), an enzyme that catalyzes the rate-limiting step in the synthesis of monounsaturated fatty acids, in tumor cells; the resulting imbalance in saturated and unsaturated fatty acids impairs tumor growth. although a ketogenic diet also inhibits scd activity in these mouse models, it supports tumor growth by increasing lipid availability and thus maintaining a balanced ratio of saturated and unsaturated fatty acids. a ketogenic diet has also been reported to raise the levels of nadh in a murine pancreatic cancer model, resulting in a sensitization of tumors to conventional cytotoxic chemotherapy. dietary restriction of serine and glycine has been found to produce an accumulation of toxic deoxysphingolipid species that limits tumor growth in xenograft mouse models of colon cancer; sphingolipids are canonically derived from serine, which is synthesized from glycine, highlighting the need for an improved understanding of the connections between the biosynthesis of lipids and other macromolecules in cancer.diet has also been shown to influence tumor growth and progression through lipid-mediated effects on cells in the tumor microenvironment. in mouse models of oral squamous cell carcinoma or melanoma, short term exposure to dietary palmitic acid, a saturated fat found in meat, dairy, palm and coconut oil, induces changes in gene expression that stimulate metastasis by promoting regeneration of tumor-activated schwann cells. a diet high in linoleic acid, a polyunsaturated fat found in vegetable oils, nuts, seeds, meat, and eggs, has also been reported to promote tumor progression in an immunocompetent mouse model of breast cancer by inducing mitochondrial dysfunction in t cells; oleic acid, which is a monounsaturated fat, did not have the same effect. the transcription factor srebp, which is itself regulated by intracellular cholesterol levels, has been shown to promote the function and specialization of regulatory t cells by controlling multiple steps in lipid metabolism, but a detailed description of how diet-driven variations in the level and/or composition of lipids in serum or tumor interstitial fluid influence immune cell function is lacking.finally, diet-sensitive interactions between the tumor and the tumor microenvironment can influence tumor growth and progression in two independent but non-mutually exclusive ways. first, tumor metabolism may respond to diet-derived metabolites in a way that creates a permissive tumor microenvironment. for example, in a mouse model of colon cancer, a high fat diet causes opposing metabolic changes in tumor and cd8+ t cells; while tumor cells increase fat uptake in response to the higher levels of circulating lipids introduced by a high fat diet, cd8+t cells do not. this results in a local depletion of essential metabolites from the tumor microenvironment. overexpressing the prolyl hydroxylase phd3 in tumor cells reduces fatty acid uptake, increases palmitate availability in tumor interstitial fluid, and reduces tumor growth as a result of improved t cell function. second, diet may shape the surrounding stromal environment to be pro-tumorigenic. overnutrition leads to increased production of the adipokine chemerin, which regulates adipogenesis and adipocyte metabolism; chemerin is also overexpressed in clear cell renal carcinomas, where it maintains high levels of the transcription factor hif2a and promotes tumor progression by suppressing fatty acid oxidation. the role chemerin plays in the progression of other cancers is not well studied, but it has been reported to directly stimulate cancer cell growth, proliferation, migration, and invasion in multiple tumor types, as well as to recruit tumor-supporting stromal cells, stimulate angiogenesis, and promote tumor suppression through immune-mediated effects.specific objectives for this foathis foa, which aligns with goal 4 of the recent nih strategic plan for nutrition research, will provide support for mechanistic investigations of the links between diet, lipid metabolism, and tumor growth and progression. studies that investigate high-fat, ketogenic diets are of particular interest since the limited data that are currently available indicate they can produce highly dichotomous effects on tumor progression, depending on tumor type and the presence or absence of specific driver mutations. mechanistic studies of dietary manipulations that perturb cancer cell metabolism in the absence of weight gain or overnutrition are also of particular interest. addressing these and other relevant problems will improve our understanding of the biology that drives tumor growth and progression, and may inform the future development of novel therapeutic approaches. however, it should be noted that for this foa, plans for clinical translation are not required, although applications may have aims that illustrate translational potential.examples of responsive research questions include, but are not limited to:applications that examine how any of the above topics contribute to health

for due dates on or after january 25, 2023, the data sharing plan and genomic data sharing plan (gds) will not be evaluated at time of review.for this particular announcement, note the following:the priority for this foa is to stimulate fundamental cancer research that will address knowledge gaps and current technical challenges that limit our understanding of the connection between (1) diet and nutrition and (2) the cancer-relevant catabolism and anabolism of lipids, including the roles these metabolic processes play in supporting the function of lipids as energy sources, signaling molecules, post-translational modifications, and/or components of physical structures such as membranes. since lipids are both the building blocks and end products of other metabolic reactions, applications may involve studies of the biosynthesis or degradation of other macromolecules as they specifically relate to lipid metabolism.applications are not limited to those that propose modifications of dietary lipids. any dietary manipulation that has a downstream effect on some aspect of lipid metabolism in tumors, or on some tumor cell non-autonomous factor, such as systemically circulating molecules or non-cancerous cells in the tumor microenvironment, that influences tumor growth and progression by acting on lipid metabolism, is of equal interest.applications do not need to show any potential for direct clinical translation. potential for clinical translation is not a requirement for this foa.overall impactreviewers will provide an overall impact score to reflect their assessment of the likelihood for the project to exert a sustained, powerful influence on the research field(s) involved, in consideration of the following review criteria and additional review

investigative team in the areas of nutrition and the analysis of dietary variables?innovationdoes the application challenge and seek to shift current research or clinical practice paradigms by utilizing novel theoretical concepts, approaches or methodologies, instrumentation, or interventions? are the concepts, approaches or methodologies, instrumentation, or interventions novel to one field of research or novel in a broad sense? is a refinement, improvement, or new application of theoretical concepts, approaches or methodologies, instrumentation, or interventions

exclusion) of individuals on the basis of sex/gender, race, and ethnicity, as well as the inclusion or exclusion of individuals of all ages (including children and older adults), justified in terms of the scientific goals and research strategy proposed?for this foa: how likely is the proposed approach to identify, or to further our understanding of, the cellular and/or molecular mechanisms through which diet influences some aspect of lipid metabolism to causally influence tumor growth and/or progression? where the research plan incorporates one or more models, how well do those models provide a window into the effects of systemic, stromal, and/or microenvironmental factors on tumor metabolism?environmentwill the scientific environment in which the work will be done contribute to the probability of success? are the institutional support, equipment, and other physical resources available to the investigators adequate for the project proposed? will the project benefit from unique features of the scientific environment, subject populations, or collaborative arrangements?additional review criteriaas applicable for the project proposed, reviewers will evaluate the following

https://www.hhs.gov/civil-rights/for-providers/provider-obligations/index.html and https://www.hhs.gov/civil-rights/for-individuals/nondiscrimination/index.htmlhhs recognizes that research projects are often limited in scope for many reasons that are nondiscriminatory, such as the principal investigator’s scientific interest, funding limitations, recruitment requirements, and other considerations. thus, criteria in research protocols that target or exclude certain populations are warranted where nondiscriminatory justifications establish that such criteria are appropriate with respect to the health or safety of the subjects, the scientific study design, or the purpose of the research. for additional guidance regarding how the provisions apply to nih grant programs, please contact the scientific/research contact that is identified in section vii under agency contacts of this foa.please contact the hhs office for civil rights for more information about obligations and

contained in section 872 of the duncan hunter national defense authorization act of fiscal year 2009 (public law 110-417), nih awards will be subject to the federal awardee performance and integrity information system (fapiis) requirements. fapiis requires federal award making officials to review and consider information about an applicant in the designated integrity and performance system (currently fapiis) prior to making an award. an applicant, at its option, may review information in the designated integrity and performance systems accessible through fapiis and comment on any information about itself that a federal agency previously entered and is currently in fapiis. the federal awarding agency will consider any comments by the applicant, in addition to other information in fapiis, in making a judgement about the applicant’s integrity, business ethics, and record of performance under federal awards when completing the review of risk posed by applicants as described in 45 cfr part 75.205 and 2 cfr part 200.206 “federal awarding agency review of risk posed by applicants.” this provision will apply to all nih grants and cooperative agreements except fellowships.the

program will be the cooperative agreement, an "assistance" mechanism (rather than an "acquisition" mechanism), in which substantial nih programmatic involvement with the recipients is anticipated during the performance of the activities. under the cooperative agreement, the nih's purpose is to support and stimulate the recipients' activities by involvement in and otherwise working jointly with the award recipients in a partnership role; it is not to assume direction, prime responsibility, or a dominant role in the activities. consistent with this concept, the dominant role and prime responsibility resides with the recipients for the project as a whole, although specific tasks and activities may be shared among the recipients and the nih as defined below.the pd(s)/pi(s) will have

requirements set forth in the required policies and procedures.nci program staff have substantial programmatic involvement that is above and beyond the normal stewardship role in awards. the substantially involved nci program staff member(s), acting as project scientist(s), will coordinate in a centralized fashion various activities of the recipients. specific responsibilities of the nci project scientist(s) will include, but will not be limited to the following:the substantially involved nci staff members will not attend peer review meetings. if such participation is deemed essential, these individuals will seek nci waivers according to the nci procedures for management of conflict of interest. in addition, an nci program director acting as a program official will be responsible for the normal scientific and programmatic stewardship of the award and will be named in the award notice.areas of joint responsibility include:since the purpose of this foa is to establish and/or further develop collaborative arrangements between extramural investigators, including but not limited to the identification of new research directions and models, many responsibilities are shared between recipients and nih staff and will require close coordination. responsibilities will be divided between recipients and nih staff, as described above.dispute resolution:any disagreements that may arise in scientific or programmatic matters (within the scope of the award) between award recipients and the nih may be brought to dispute resolution. a dispute resolution panel composed of three members will be convened: a representative chosen by two-thirds vote of recipients without input from nih staff, one nih designee, and a third designee with expertise in the relevant area who is chosen by the other two; in the case of individual disagreement, the first member may be chosen by the individual recipient. this special dispute resolution procedure does not alter the recipient's right to appeal an adverse action that is otherwise appealable in accordance with phs regulation 42 cfr part 50, subpart d and dhhs regulation 45 cfr part 16.3. data management and sharingnote: the nih policy for data management and sharing is effective for due dates on or after january 25, 2023.consistent with the nih policy for data management and
