(nci), the national institute of aging (nia), the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases (niaid), the national institute of biomedical imaging and bioengineering (nibib), the eunice kennedy shriver national institute of child health and human development (nichd), the national institute of general medical sciences (nigms), and the national human genome research institute (nhgri) are encouraging new applications to advance research activities relevant to synthetic biology.backgroundone of the great challenges in biomedical research is to be able to quantitatively predict, test, and harness the complex dynamics of biological systems. synthetic biology is the design and construction of new biological parts and systems, and the re-design of existing and natural biological systems for specific purposes. in contrast to the traditional genetic engineering approach, which usually focuses on individual genes and proteins, synthetic biology adopts a more systematic approach targeting entire pathways, networks, and whole organisms with quantitative control and modulation. gaining new insights into the complex and dynamic biological pathways of designer cells and tissues and developing cell-based and cell-free diagnostics and therapies are at the frontiers of biomedical science. enabling these de novo biological systems will require the ability to design and build complex pathways with endogenous or novel functions and with predictable and quantitative responses to endogenous or environmental signals. achieving this paradigm will allow the testing of hypotheses on complex biological systems and the development of novel therapeutic strategies and diagnostic capabilities. to improve the reach and impact of engineering biology on human health, an integrative research plan based on collaborations of synthetic biologists with computational scientists, cell biologists, engineers, geneticists, developmental biologists, and/or physician scientists is strongly recommended.research objectivesthe overarching goal(s) of this notice are to:nccih statement of interestnccih supports a diverse portfolio of natural products research. this includes the use of systems biology technology to better understand the biosynthesis and beneficial functions of natural products. this includes support for development and application of synthetic biology approaches to assess mechanisms of action and causal effects of beneficial microbes in human. nccih encourages applications to this initiative aimed at elucidating biosynthetic pathways for high value, plant based, natural products and developing ways to improve their production in either native or heterologous hosts.in the context of this initiative, high value, plant based, natural products are defined as those which have well established therapeutic properties for humans. use of systems biology for the engineering and production of compounds which are not known from a natural source are considered low priority for nccih.examples of research of interest to nccih include, but are not limited to:nci statement of interestthe national cancer institute (nci) supports a broad-based portfolio of cancer research and development projects encompassing basic, translational, clinical, and epidemiological inquiries.this includes support for the development and application of novel enabling technologies in a broad range of cancer research. nci strongly encourages multidisciplinary collaborations between synthetic biologists and cancer biologists or translational cancer researchers in developing novel solutions to tackle critical cancer problems. some general examples that are relevant to this foa include, but are not limited to:nhgri statement of interestthe national human genome research institute (nhgri) supports a broad portfolio of genomics-based projects to accelerate scientific and medical breakthroughs that improve human health. this is driven by cutting-edge genomics research and technology development. for the purposes of this nosi, nhgri encourages synthetic biology approaches relevant to genomics. research or tools development that are only applicable to one or a small number of genomic loci, diseases, or biological systems are generally beyond the scope of nhgri.examples of research of interest to nhgri include, but are not limited to:applicants interested in synthesis of nucleic acids should also see rfa-hg-20-014, “novel synthetic nucleic acid technology development,” which is focused on novel technologies and instrumentation to improve the development of synthetic constructs and synthetic nucleic acid capabilities.a complete list of nhgri supported research domains can be found at: https://www.genome.gov/research-funding. nhgri will not accept applications in response to this nosi that propose a clinical trial.nia statement of interestthe national institute on aging (nia) supports multiple portfolios on diverse aspects of aging, from social and behavioral research to the basic biology of aging, encompassing epidemiological, clinical, translational, behavioral, neurobiological and basic studies. this includes support for the development and application of novel enabling technologies in a broad range of aging research. in joining this nosi, nia encourages multidisciplinary collaborations between synthetic biologists and investigators from all aspects of aging research to develop novel synthetic biological tools and approaches.areas of interest to nia include, but are not limited to:niaid statement of interestthe niaid mission is to conduct and support basic and applied research to better understand, treat, and ultimately prevent infectious, immunologic, and allergic diseases. niaid has a unique mandate, which requires the institute to respond to emerging public health threats. synthetic biology technology represents a foundation to improve our ability to prevent, diagnose, and treat infectious and immune-mediated diseases and to better understand complex host immune responses to such diseases. niaid encourages collaboration between synthetic biologists and infectious disease scientists and/or immunologists for either basic or translational applications.examples of research of interest to niaid include, but are not limited to:nibib statement of interestthe national institute of biomedical imaging and bioengineering (nibib) is interested in projects focused on the development of modular platform technologies to enable a new paradigm of biomedical intervention. through this foa, the nibib seeks applications with a particular emphasis on technologies to enable synthetic biology approaches or that are driven by synthetic biology approaches.examples of research of interest to nibib include, but are not limited to:a complete list of programmatic interests in nibib can be found at:https://www.nibib.nih.gov/research-funding.furthermore, the nibib mission does not include the development of new technologies to address basic research questions in cellular processes, functions, and structure. for research leading to the development of such technologies, applicants should consult the national institute of general medical sciences (nigms).note: for applications submitted to this nosi that propose clinical trials, nibib will only support applications proposing early stage clinical trials through phase i, first-in-human, safety, feasibility, or other small clinical trials that inform the early stage technology development in the submitted application. nibib will not support applications proposing phase ii, iii, iv or pivotal clinical trials, or trials in which the primary outcome is efficacy, effectiveness, or a post-market concern.nichd statement of interestnichd is interested in projects that focus on understanding the biological processes that control typical and atypical embryonic development, and the cellular, morphological, and molecular mechanisms that underlie susceptibilities and causes of structural birth defects.research topics that are of interest to nichd that fall within the scope of this nosi include, but are not limited to:nigms statement of interestthe national institute of general medical sciences (nigms) supports basic research that increases our understanding of biological processes and lays the foundation for advances in disease diagnosis, treatment, and prevention. nigms welcomes applications that fall within its mission to address fundamental research questions. nigms encourages technologies and approaches related to synthetic biology that include, but are not limited to:the institute places great emphasis on supporting investigator-initiated research grants. for this nosi, nigms will not accept applications that include research which meets the nih definition of a clinical trial.application and submission informationapplicants must select the ic and associated foa to use for submission of an application in
