review information section vi. award administration information section vii. agency contacts section viii. other informationthis funding opportunity announcement (foa) invites applications for center grants to support advanced laboratories for accelerating the reach and impact of treatments for youth and adults with mental illness (alacrity) centers. the purpose of these research centers is to support transdisciplinary teams of clinical and mental health services researchers, behavioral scientists, social scientists, health information and communications technologists, health systems engineers, decision scientists, and mental health stakeholders (e.g., service users, family members, clinicians, payers) to engage in high-impact studies that will significantly advance clinical practice and generate knowledge that will fuel transformation of mental health care in the united states. successful alacrity centers will address major mental health problems observed among children, youth, and/or adults (including older adults), and foster innovative research aimed at increasing the effectiveness of existing interventions, improving delivery and quality of evidence-based services, and accelerating the diffusion, implementation, and continuous improvement of new practices in diverse settings. center-supported research should reflect a deployment-focused model of intervention and services design and testing that considers key characteristics of the settings and providers where optimized mental health interventions and services will be implemented.the alacrity centers program is intended to support research that maximizes synergies across disciplines and has a high potential for increasing the public health impact of existing and emerging mental health interventions and service delivery strategies. the centers are intended for transdisciplinary projects that could not be achieved using standard research project grant mechanisms. support is provided both for individual research projects and for cores that are critical for the integration across alacrity components. centers are expected to provide plans for rapid, widespread sharing of relevant data, methods, and resources that will promote near-term improvements in clinical practice, as well as plans that further advance research focused on intervention effectiveness and/or services. a strong vision of how the alacrity center will advance the field beyond the goals of the individual projects is essential for successful applications.alacrity centers also provide opportunities for graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, and investigators in early stages of independent careers to participate in interdisciplinary research.in any given year, nearly one-fifth of all u.s. adults struggle with a mental illness. according to recent estimates, mental illnesses account for 21.3 percent of all years lived with disability in the united states. an estimated 11.4 million american adults suffer from a serious mental illness (smi) in which the ability to function in daily life is significantly impaired. those with smi die 10 years earlier than individuals in the general population, on average. a conservative estimate places the direct and indirect financial costs associated with mental illnesses in the united states at well over $300 billion annually. mental illnesses rank as the third most costly medical conditions in terms of overall health care expenditure, behind heart conditions and traumatic injury. in addition, between two and four hundred thousand men and women with smi are incarcerated in u.s. jails and prisons, where they may receive inadequate treatment and often no aftercare following release to the community. this public health burden demands that we combine current knowledge about effective mental disorder treatments with emerging health information and communication technologies, health care informatics, data science tools, and novel organizational structures for delivering health care to achieve significantly better outcomes for these disabling conditions.furthermore, in 2019, more than 47,000 americans died from suicide, more than twice the annual mortality from homicide. suicide attempts and ideation far exceed these numbers. (applicants interested in submitting applications to support transdisciplinary programs of research focused on identification, prevention, and treatment of suicide risk, specifically, are directed to par-20-286 ("practice-based suicide prevention research centers (p50)")).the primary purpose of each alacrity center is to support rapid development, testing, and refinement of innovative approaches for (1) optimizing the effectiveness of therapeutic or preventive interventions for mental disorders within well-defined target populations; (2) organizing and delivering optimized mental health services within real world treatment settings; and (3) continuously improving the quality, impact, and sustainability of optimized interventions and service delivery strategies within diverse care systems. to achieve these ambitious goals, each alacrity center aims to support multidisciplinary teams of leading clinical and mental health services researchers, and experts from allied disciplines such as behavioral scientists, social scientists, health information and communications technologists, health systems engineers, decision scientists, and mental health stakeholders (e.g., service users, family members, clinicians, payers) to engage in studies focused on selected populations for whom existing interventions or services do not adequately address urgent, unmet mental health needs.the nimh strategic plan for research was developed to inspire and support research that takes advantage of recent technological advances and opportunities, and to bring into sharper focus questions and perspectives that will transform the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of mental disorders. strategic research objectives 3.2, 3.3, and 4.1 – 4.4, which focus on optimizing existing and new interventions, translating effective interventions to community practice settings, and strengthening the public health impact of nimh-supported research, are particularly relevant to alacrity centers.the alacrity centers program provides a mechanism for maximizing synthesis and potential synergies across various components of the mental health research ecosystem, including new discoveries in basic and clinical research, transformative health care technologies, advances in information science, behavioral economic strategies for influencing health behaviors, and new federal and state mechanisms for organizing and financing mental health care. alacrity centers provide a unique opportunity for addressing t2 translational priorities outlined in the nimh strategic plan, i.e., effective transfer of findings from clinical studies to practice settings and communities, where research findings can be applied to improve public health.some general characteristics of alacrity centers are listed below:potential applicants are strongly encouraged to discuss their research concept and approach, and alignment of planned center goals with the nimh strategic plan for research, with appropriate nimh contacts before developing their application [see section vii agency contacts].the nimh has published updated policies and guidance for investigators regarding human research protection and clinical research data and safety monitoring (not-mh-19-027). the application’s protection of human subjects section should reflect the policies and guidance in this notice. plans for the protection of research subjects and data and safety monitoring will be reviewed by the nimh for consistency with nimh and nih policies and federal regulations.see section viii. other information

avoiding common errors.upon receipt, applications will be evaluated for completeness and compliance with application instructions by the center for scientific review, nih. applications that are incomplete or non-compliant will not be reviewed.many nih ics encourage the use of common data elements (cdes) in basic, clinical, and applied research, patient registries, and other human subject research to facilitate broader and more effective use of data and advance research across studies. cdes are data elements that have been identified and defined for use in multiple data sets across different studies. use of cdes can facilitate data sharing and standardization to improve data quality and enable data integration from multiple studies and sources, including electronic health records. nih ics have identified cdes for many clinical domains (e.g., neurological disease), types of studies (e.g., genome-wide association studies (gwas)), types of outcomes (e.g., patient-reported outcomes), and patient registries (e.g., the global rare diseases patient registry and data repository). nih has established a “common data element (cde) resource portal" (http://cde.nih.gov/) to assist investigators in identifying nih-supported cdes when developing protocols, case report forms, and other instruments for data collection. the portal provides guidance about and access to nih-supported cde initiatives and other tools and resources for the appropriate use of cdes and data standards in nih-funded research. investigators are encouraged to consult the portal and describe in their applications any use they will make of nih-supported cdes in their projects.applicants are required to follow the instructions for post-submission materials, as described in the policy. any instructions provided here are in addition to the instructions in the policy.note: effective for due dates on or after january 25, 2023, the data sharing plan and genomic data sharing plan (gds) as
