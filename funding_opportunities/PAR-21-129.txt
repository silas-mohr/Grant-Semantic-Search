https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/pa-files/PAR-21-129.html
national institutes of health (nih)national institute of mental health (nimh)r01 research project grant see notices of special interest associated with this funding opportunitysee section iii. 3. additional information on eligibility.nimh solicits clinical trial applications through a series of funding opportunity announcements (foas) that cover the intervention development pipeline, from first-inhuman, early testing of new interventions, confirmatory efficacy trials, through to effectiveness trials. this foa seeks to support clinical trials to establish the effectiveness of interventions and to test hypotheses regarding moderators, mediators, and mechanisms of action of these interventions. this foa supports clinical trials designed to test the therapeutic value of treatment and preventive interventions for which there is already evidence of efficacy, for use in community and practice settings. applications might include research to evaluate the effectiveness or increase the clinical impact of pharmacologic, somatic, psychosocial (e.g., psychotherapeutic, behavioral), device-based, rehabilitative and combination interventions to prevent or treat mental illness. this foa also supports clinical trials to test patient-, provider-, organizational-, or systems-level services interventions to improve access, continuity, quality, equity, and/or value of services. the intervention research covered under this announcement is explicitly focused on practice-relevant questions. this foa supports trials that require participation of two or more collaborative sites for completion of the study. accordingly, the collaborating studies share a specific protocol across the sites and are organized as such in order to increase sample size, accelerate recruitment, or increase sample diversity and representation. each site has its own program director/principal investigator (pd/pi) and the program provides a mechanism for cross-site coordination, quality control, database management, statistical analysis, and reporting. support for fully-powered effectiveness studies via a single r01 grant is provided through a separate foa, par-21-130, "clinical trials to test the effectiveness of treatment, preventive, and services interventions (r01)." this foa is designed for applicants seeking funding for multi-site collaborative clinical trials to establish the effectiveness of interventions. applicants pursuing other stages of the clinical trial pipeline should consider one of the companion foas listed above.30 days prior to the application due dateall applications are due by 5:00 pm local time of applicant organization. all types of non-aids applications allowed for this funding opportunity announcement are due on the listed date(s).applicants are encouraged to apply early to allow adequate time to make any corrections to errors found in the application during the submission process by the due date.not applicableit is critical that applicants follow the instructions in the research (r) instructions in the sf424 (r&r) application guide, except where instructed to do otherwise (in this foa or in a notice from nih guide for grants and contracts).conformance to all requirements (both in the application guide and the foa) is required and strictly enforced. applicants must read and follow all application instructions in the application guide as well as any program-specific instructions noted in section iv. when the program-specific instructions deviate from those in the application guide, follow the program-specific instructions.applications that do not comply with these instructions may be delayed or not accepted for review.there are several options available to submit your application through grants.gov to nih and department of health and human services partners. you must use one of these submission options to access the application forms for this opportunity.purposethe purpose of this foa is to support collaborative research to test the effectiveness of treatment, preventive, and services strategies for use in community and practice settings and to test hypotheses regarding moderators, mediators, and mechanisms of action of these interventions. this foa supports research to evaluate the effectiveness of pharmacologic, psychosocial (e.g., psychotherapeutic, behavioral), somatic, device-based, rehabilitative and combination interventions that show promise, compared to existing treatment approaches, for improving symptomatic and functional outcomes for mental disorders. studies that address either acute or longer-term therapeutic effects are encouraged. this foa also supports clinical trials to test patient-, provider-, organizational-, or systems-level services interventions to improve service access, engagement, quality, coordination, or delivery, with the goal of improved outcomes for individual patients, as well as larger populations. the intervention research covered under this announcement is explicitly focused on practice-relevant questions. this foa is intended to support research on interventions/services models that have the potential to substantially impact practice and public health in terms of the magnitude of likely improvements in key outcomes (e.g., clinical benefit, safety/tolerability profile, value and efficiency, or scalability potential), as compared to existing approaches.research objectivesin general, prior to effectiveness testing, results from more highly controlled studies provide empirical support regarding the intervention’s efficacy and the mechanism that underlies clinical benefit (i.e., evidence that the intervention engages its intended neurobiological or psychological targets, and changes in these targets lead to functional improvement and clinical benefit). consistent with the nimh experimental therapeutics approach, this foa is intended to support effectiveness trials that not only test the intervention effects on outcomes of interest, but also to explicitly inform understanding regarding whether the intervention engages associated change mechanisms that were previously identified under more controlled efficacy conditions, thereby reconfirming the intervention targets and testing whether previously identified change mechanisms are operative in the effectiveness context (see support for clinical trials at nimh). in this manner, the results of the effectiveness trial will advance knowledge regarding intervention targets/change mechanisms and have utility regardless of trial outcomes (e.g., in the event of negative results, information about whether the intervention was successful at engaging its targets can facilitate interpretation). accordingly, the application/scope of work should address the following: 1) the empirical basis for the selection of the proximal targets (e.g., prior evidence linking the targets to the outcomes of interest; 2) plans for assessing whether the intervention leads to the hypothesized changes in proximal targets/mechanisms; and plans for analyses to examine whether intervention-induced changes in the targets/mechanisms are associated with and account for changes in the outcomes of interest.depending on the nature of the intervention, the “targets” or mechanism of action might vary, but should be empirically justified. for preventive and therapeutic interventions, targets include factors that have been empirically associated with risk for or the etiology, maintenance, severity/course of the disorder or condition of interest. these targets might involve specific psychological, behavioral, or interpersonal processes (e.g., cognitive-affective processes such as emotion regulation, attention bias, cognitive control, stress regulation) or neurobiological processes or entities (e.g. brain circuits). for studies that involve preventive or therapeutic interventions, nimh encourages research that takes into account the research domain criteria initiative (rdoc) or rdoc-like constructs when defining the subject eligibility (inclusion), intervention targets or mechanisms, and outcomes, as appropriate and feasible in the effectiveness setting (see the rdoc webpage for more details). in the case of services interventions, targets/mechanisms might involve mutable consumer- or provider-behaviors, or organizational-/system-level factors that have been empirically demonstrated to facilitate or impede service use, delivery, and outcomes, and are intervened upon in order to improve access, continuity, quality, equity, and/or value of services.valid and reliable measures of change in the hypothesized target(s)/mechanism(s) will provide useful information about key change mechanisms that account for effects. in the assessment of target engagement, nimh encourages the use of measures that are as direct and objective as is feasible in the effectiveness setting. specifically encouraged are empirically validated measures of the construct that extend beyond self-reports and other subjective measures (e.g., data from behavioral observations, computer-based tasks, electronic health records or other administrative sources), where possible, and inclusion of measures that span more than one level of assessment if feasible and appropriate.with appropriate justification, effectiveness testing of preventive and therapeutic interventions might be warranted in the absence of extensive efficacy data (e.g., when the intervention is primarily comprised of research informed strategies, but the specific strategies that haven't been extensively tested in combination or with a specific target population; when there is strong pilot data and the goal is to conduct further testing in a deployment-focused manner to expedite the translation into practice). to reduce the alarming fall-off in effect sizes from efficacy to effectiveness studies, and to expedite translation from intervention development to practice-ready interventions, this foa encourages investigators to conduct rigorous trials in community settings as early as possible in the intervention development sequence. depending on the intervention type and measurement involved, and with strong justification, this announcement seeks trials with high internal validity, albeit with community therapists and typical community patients in community settings, as an alternative to traditional early efficacy trials (e.g., in laboratory settings).research responsive to this announcement must involve trials with prospective data collection in which patients are assigned to specific intervention conditions. while random allocation to intervention conditions is expected in most cases, depending on the study question, practical constraints, and ethical considerations, quasi-experimental designs with non-randomized comparison groups might be appropriate, with strong justification. applicants are encouraged to contact scientific/research staff with questions regarding responsive trial designs and alternative foas.comparison or control conditions may include treatment-as-usual or other standard or experimental interventions of proven efficacy, as appropriate given the research question. however, placebo or sham interventions might be used where appropriately justified, for example, in studies of augmentation strategies (blinded) added to existing treatments (generally open-label). in contrast to efficacy trials, it is anticipated that effectiveness trials might not be double-blind; while self- and clinician-ratings can be informative and may reasonably be collected, unless otherwise justified, raters responsible for key outcome measures should be blinded as to subjects’ treatment assignment. primary outcome measures should be validated and generally accepted by the field. given the emphasis on practice relevant questions, outcomes of interest extend beyond symptom reduction to include short- and long-term assessment of changes in functioning across domains (such as school, work, family, peer functioning) for children, adolescents, and adults, and also might include other outcomes of interest to key stakeholders (e.g., efficiency, value, or other factors related to the eventual implementation of new intervention and services approaches).given the focus on practice-relevant questions in community and practice settings, collaborations between academic researchers and clinical or community practice partners or networks are expected. when possible, studies should capitalize on existing infrastructure (e.g., practice-based research networks such as the nimh-sponsored mental health research network (mhrn), electronic medical records, administrative databases, patient registries, institutions with clinical and translational science awards) to increase the efficiency of participant recruitment (i.e., more rapid identification and enrollment) and to facilitate the collection of moderator data (e.g., clinical characteristics, biomarkers), longer-term follow-up data, and broader, stakeholder-relevant outcomes (e.g., mental health and general health care utilization, value and efficiency of intervention and service-delivery approaches).effective prevention and treatment of mental illness have the potential to reduce morbidity and mortality associated with intentional injury (i.e., suicide attempts and deaths, see: www.suicide-research-agenda.org). lack of attention to the assessment of these outcomes has limited our understanding regarding the degree to which effective mental health interventions might offer prophylaxis. accordingly, where feasible and appropriate, nimh encourages effectiveness research that includes assessment of suicidal behavior to advance understanding of how effective prevention and treatment of mental disorders might impact suicide-relevant outcomes.studies that build in efficiencies to expedite enrollment and the delivery of practice-relevant results will be considered of higher priority by the nimh.potential applicants are strongly encouraged to contact scientific/research contacts as far in advance as possible to discuss the match between potential research applications and current nimh priorities and relevant funding mechanisms.information about the mission, strategic plan, and research interests of the nimh can be found on the nimh website. applicants are also strongly encouraged to review the information on support for clinical trials at nimh and the nimh webpage on clinical research.priorities and considerations for effectiveness trials researchgiven the resources necessary to launch large-scale trials and conduct intervention research in community/practice settings, studies should be justified in terms of potential clinical/public health impact; potential to inform understanding of targets/mechanisms of action and personalized strategies; and use of innovative platforms (e.g. registries) and designs (e.g., time and cost efficiencies for enrolling representative patient samples via networks or other existing infrastructure). nimh strongly discourages large scale trials designed to detect incremental gains in established effects; expensive trials of on-patent medications without demonstrated superiority over off-patent medications; and trials adapting currently available treatments for new subpopulations without strong empirical justification.to facilitate the translations into practice:this foa is intended to support effectiveness research as follows:examples of clinical trials that would be considered responsive to the goals of this foa include but are not limited to:applications not responsive to this foastudies that are not responsive to this foa and will not be reviewed include the following:updated priorities for nimh clinical trials research

application guide.the following modifications also apply:all applications, regardless of the amount of direct costs requested for any one year, should address a data sharing planto advance the goal of advancing research through widespread data sharing among researchers, investigators funded under this foa are expected to share those data via the national data archive (nda; see not-mh-19-033). established by the nih, nda is a secure informatics platform for scientific collaboration and data-sharing that enables the effective communication of detailed research data, tools, and supporting documentation. nda links data across research projects through its global unique identifier (guid) and data dictionary technology. investigators funded under this foa are expected to use these technologies to submit data to nda.to accomplish this objective, it will be important to formulate a) an enrollment strategy that will obtain the information necessary to generate a guid for each participant, and b) a budget strategy that will cover the costs of data submission. the nda web site provides two tools to help investigators develop appropriate strategies: 1) the nda data submission cost model which offers a customizable excel worksheet that includes tasks and hours for the program director/principal investigator and data manager to budget for data sharing; and 2) plain language text to be considered in your informed consent available from the nda's data contribution page. investigators are expected to certify the quality of all data generated by grants funded under this foa prior to submission to nda and review their data for accuracy after submission. submission of descriptive/raw data is expected semi-annually (every january 15 and july 15); submission of all other data is expected at the time of publication, or prior to the end of the grant, whichever occurs first (see nda sharing regimen for more information); investigators are expected to share results, positive and negative, specific to the cohorts and outcome measures studied. the nda data sharing plan is available for review on the nda website. nda staff will work with investigators to help them submit data types not yet defined in the nda data dictionary.when involving human subjects research, clinical research, and/or nih-defined clinical trials (and when applicable, clinical trials research experience) follow all instructions for the phs human subjects and clinical trials information form in the sf424 (r&r) application guide, with the following additional instructions:if you

elements").use of common data elements in nih-funded researchmany nih ics encourage the use of common data elements (cdes) in basic, clinical, and applied research, patient registries, and other human subject research to facilitate broader and more effective use of data and advance research across studies. cdes are data elements that have been identified and defined for use in multiple data sets across different studies. use of cdes can facilitate data sharing and standardization to improve data quality and enable data integration from multiple studies and sources, including electronic health records. nih ics have identified cdes for many clinical domains (e.g., neurological disease), types of studies (e.g. genome-wide association studies (gwas)), types of outcomes (e.g., patient-reported outcomes), and patient registries (e.g., the global rare diseases patient registry and data repository). nih has established a “common data element (cde) resource portal" (http://cde.nih.gov/) to assist investigators in identifying nih-supported cdes when developing protocols, case report forms, and other instruments for data collection. the portal provides guidance about and access to nih-supported cde initiatives and other tools and resources for the appropriate use of cdes and data standards in nih-funded research. investigators are encouraged to consult the portal and describe in their applications any use they will make of nih-supported cdes in their projects.additional information about linked applicationsapplications must be submitted as a linked group or set of r01s, usually one r01 per participating pd/pi. for each set of linked collaborative r01 applications, it is expected that each application/site will involve recruitment and enrollment of participants and executing a common protocol. it is expected that each application will be coordinated and interlocked with the others as each application will contribute an essential component to the overall study. however, there are likely to be elements unique to some sites (e.g., data coordination, fidelity assessment, statistical analyses).applicants are required to follow the instructions for post-submission materials, as described in the policy. any instructions provided here are in addition to the instructions in the policy.note: effective for due dates on or after january 25, 2023, the
