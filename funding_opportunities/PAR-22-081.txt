national institutes of health (nih)division of program coordination, planning and strategic initiatives, office of research infrastructure programs (orip) national institute of general medical sciences (nigms)national institute of general medical sciences (nigms)s10 biomedical research support shared instrumentation grantssee notices of special interest associated with this funding opportunitysee section iii. 3. additional information on eligibility.the basic instrumentation grant (big) program encourages applications from groups of nih-supported investigators to purchase a single high-priced, specialized, commercially available instrument or an integrated instrumentation system.the big program is limited to institutions that have not received s10 instrumentation funding of $250,001 or greater in any of the preceding 3 federal fiscal years (fy). use the following to determine applicable funding periods:the minimum award is $25,000. there is no maximum price limit for the instrument; however, the maximum award is $250,000. instruments supported include, but are not limited to, basic cell sorters, confocal microscopes, ultramicrotomes, gel imagers, or computer systems.not applicableall applications are due by 5:00 pm local time of applicant organization.applicants are encouraged to apply early to allow adequate time to make any corrections to errors found in the application during the submission process by the due date.not applicableit is critical that applicants follow the instructions in the research (r) instructions in the sf424 (r&r) application guide,except where instructed to do otherwise (in this foa or in a notice from nih guide for grants and contracts ).conformance to all requirements (both in the application guide and the foa) is required and strictly enforced. applicants must read and follow all application instructions in the application guide as well as any program-specific instructions noted in section iv. when the program-specific instructions deviate from those in the application guide, follow the program-specific instructions.applications that do not comply with these instructions may be delayed or not accepted for review.there are several options available to submit your application through grants.gov to nih and department of health and human services partners. you must use one of these submission options to access the application forms for this opportunity.with this funding opportunity announcement (foa), orip continues the basic instrumentation grant (big) program. the program targets institutions that have not received a substantial s10 shared instrumentation award funding of a total of $250,001 or greater in any of the last 3 federal fys – see section iii.3. additional information on eligibility for eligibility requirements. use the following to determine applicable funding periods:institutions that are not major recipients of nih research funding are especially encouraged to apply. often such institutions are in institutional development award (idea)-eligible states or serve underrepresented populations. the main objective of the big program is to make available modern scientific instruments that are needed by nih-funded investigators and other groups of biomedical scientists to advance their research and to broaden access to modern technologies at academic and research institutions nationwide. typically, state-of-the-art technologies that are indispensable for today’s research are too costly for a single investigator to purchase or operate. their acquisitions can only be justified on a shared-use basis.the big program supports acquisitions of scientific instruments that are justified by investigators’ needs to pursue their scientific projects in basic, translational, or clinical fields. the program requires that three major users with nih-funded research projects demonstrate significant need for the requested instrument. once the requirement of three major users with nih research funding has been met, additional major users may be included – see section iii.3. additional information on eligibility for the major user group requirement. it is expected that the instrument, by augmenting institutional research capabilities, will invigorate current research, contribute to opportunities for novel research projects, stimulate new collaborations, and increase overall research competitiveness. moreover, a broader research community at the applicant or regional institution(s) should benefit from access to the instrument.the big program provides funds to purchase a single costly, specialized, commercially available instrument or an integrated instrumentation system. an integrated instrumentation system is one in which the components, when used in conjunction with one another, perform a function that no single component can provide. the components must be dedicated to the system and not used independently. types of instruments supported include, but are not limited to, basic cell sorters, confocal microscopes, ultramicrotomes, gel imagers, or computer systems. applications for standalone computer systems (supercomputers, computer clusters, and data storage systems) will only be considered if the system is solely dedicated to biomedical research. all instruments, integrated systems, and computer systems must be dedicated to research only.foreign-made instruments are allowed.the big program will not support requests for:applicants are advised to discuss with the big scientific/research contact (see section vii) any questions about appropriate types of equipment, eligibility, and program requirements, prior to submitting an application for an integrated instrumentation system.to promote cost effectiveness, to encourage optimal sharing among individual investigators, research groups and departments, and to foster a collaborative multidisciplinary environment, the instrument must be integrated in a core facility, another shared resource, or a shared laboratory space.each applicant institution must propose a program director/principal investigator (pd/pi) who can assume administrative and scientific oversight responsibility for the requested instrumentation. see section iii.1 for qualifications for the pd/pi. the pd/pi also will be responsible for:an advisory committee must be named to assist the pd/pi in administering the grant and overseeing the usage of the instrument. for details on the composition of the advisory committee, see section iv.2 under "administration." the pd/pi and the advisory committee are responsible for the development of guidelines for:the pd/pi and the advisory committee should convene meetings and issue annual reports on the instrument status, including their recommendations for the instrument operations.nigms is interested in co-funding s10 applications that include research projects aligned with the mission of nigms. nigms-supported research may utilize specific cells or organ systems if they serve as models for understanding general systemic principles. nigms also supports research in specific clinical areas that affect multiple organ systems.in parallel, nigms is especially interested in promoting participation of institutional development award (idea) states and programs in the s10 program. the idea program will provide co-funding for scientifically meritorious applications from idea states and encourages sharing and collaboration among institutions, programs, and states.applications not responsive to this foaan individual application requesting more than one type of instrument (for example, a mass spectrometer and a confocal microscope) is not responsive to this foa and will not be reviewedsee section viii. other information for award authorities and regulations.grant: a support mechanism providing money, property, or both to an eligible entity to carry out an approved project or activity.the oer glossary and the sf424 (r&r) application guide provide details on these application types. only those application types listed here are allowed for this foa.the oer glossary and the sf424 (r&r) application guide provide details on these application types. only those application types listed here are allowed for this foa.not allowed: only accepting applications that do not propose clinical trials.need help determining whether you are doing a clinical trial?need help determining whether you are doing a clinical trial?the number of awards is contingent upon nih appropriations and the submission of a sufficient number of meritorious applications.applications will be accepted that request a single, commercially available instrument or an integrated instrumentation system. the minimum award is $25,000. there is no upper limit on the cost of the instrument, but the maximum award is $250,000. since the cost of various instruments will vary, it is anticipated that the amount of the award will also vary. s10 awards do not allow indirect costs.it is expected that applicants will employ the most economical approaches, including securing academic discounts, to formulate a cost-effective budget while meeting users' scientific needs. see section iv. 6. funding restrictions for additional details.awards are made for one year only.nih grants policies as described in the nih grants policy statement will apply to the applications submitted and awards made from this foa.1. eligible applicantshigher education institutionsthe following types of higher education institutions are always encouraged to apply for nih support as public or private institutions of higher education:nonprofits other than institutions of higher educationnon-domestic (non-u.s.) entities (foreign institutions) are not eligible to apply.non-domestic (non-u.s.) components of u.s. organizations are not eligible to apply.foreign components, as defined in the nih grants policy statement, are not allowed.applicant organizationsapplicant organizations must complete and maintain the following registrations as described in the sf 424 (r&r) application guide to be eligible to apply for or receive an award. all registrations must be completed prior to the application being submitted. registration can take 6 weeks or more, so applicants should begin the registration process as soon as possible. the nih policy on late submission of grant applications states that failure to complete registrations in advance of a due date is not a valid reason for a late submission.program directors/principal investigators (pd(s)/pi(s))all pd(s)/pi(s) must have an era commons account. pd(s)/pi(s) should work with their organizational officials to either create a new account or to affiliate their existing account with the applicant organization in era commons. if the pd/pi is also the organizational signing official, they must have two distinct era commons accounts, one for each role. obtaining an era commons account can take up to 2 weeks.any individual(s) with the skills, knowledge, and resources necessary to carry out the proposed research as the program director(s)/principal investigator(s) (pd(s)/pi(s)) is invited to work with his/her organization to develop an application for support. individuals from underrepresented racial and ethnic groups as well as individuals with disabilities are always encouraged to apply for nih support.the pd/pi should document (in the biographical sketch) technical expertise directly related to the type of requested instrument. the pd/pi does not need to have an nih research grant or any other research support but is expected to be an expert on the requested instrument. the pd/pi may be a core director, tenured, or non-tenured faculty member of the applicant organization. the pd/pi must be affiliated with the applicant organization and must be registered on era commons.multiple pds/pis are not allowed under the s10 mechanism.2. cost sharingthis foa does not require cost sharing as defined in the nih grants policy statement.3. additional information on eligibilitynumber of applicationsthe nih will not accept duplicate or highly overlapping applications under review at the same time, per 2.3.7.4 submission of resubmission application. this means that the nih will not accept:only one big application per institution as identified by the uei number, is allowed per due date.any institution that received a total of $250,001 or more of s10 grant funding in any of the preceding 3 federal fys is not eligible to apply to this foa. use the following to determine applicable funding periods:there is no restriction on the number of applications an institution (as identified by a specific unique entity identifier (uei)) can submit to the companion funding opportunities (shared instrumentation grants (sig) and/or high-end instrumentation (hei) grant programs) each year, provided the applications request different types of equipment. concurrent big, sig or hei applications for the same instrument (or the same type of instrument with added special accessories – for example, to meet the hei budget requirement) are not allowed unless documentation from a high-level institutional official is provided, stating that this is not an unintended duplication, but part of a campus-wide instrumentation plan. applicants are advised to discuss with the big scientific/research contact (section vii) potential duplicates before submitting two applications for the same type of instrument. a single application requesting more than one type of instrument (for example, a spectrometer and a microscope) is not responsive to this foa and will not be reviewed.major user groupa major user is a researcher who has a substantial need for the instrument.a group of three major users each with any active nih research award (grant or cooperative agreement, including, but not limited to, the following mechanisms: r03, r15, r21, sc1, sc2, or sc3) must be identified. nih training or fellowship grants (i.e., t and f mechanisms), other non-research and sbir/sttr grants, other transaction (ot) awards, and contracts cannot be counted towards the fulfillment of this requirement. an award given to multi-pds/pis is counted only once towards the fulfillment of this requirement. once this requirement has been met, other major or minor users with research funding from nih or other sources such as other federal agencies, private foundations, or academic and research institutions may be added. major users can be researchers from the same department or from several departments, divisions, or schools at the applicant institution, or from nearby or regional institutions.to demonstrate the clear need for the requested instrument, the projects of major users supported by any nih research awards should collectively use the instrument at the 25% level of the aut or higher. moreover, the total collective usage for all identified users should be at the 75% level of aut instrument usage or higher; see section iv.2 other project information for the definition of aut.the major user group must meet the eligibility requirement at the time of submission. in addition, if/when the application is considered for funding, the big program staff will check that the major user group eligibility requirement is also met at the time of award.quotean itemized quote from the vendor with appropriate academic discounts and warranty terms (specified directly in the quote) is required and must be included in the application.1. requesting an application packagethe application forms package specific to this opportunity must be accessed through assist, grants.gov workspace or an institutional system-to-system solution. links to apply using assist or grants.gov workspace are available in part 1 of this foa. see your administrative office for instructions if you plan to use an institutional system-to-system solution.2. content and form of application submissionpage limitationsall page limitations described in the sf424 application guide and the table of page limits must be followed.for this foa, there is no overall page limit for the entire instrumentation plan. however, there are specified page limits for each section of the instrumentation plan as described below. all tables, graphs, figures, diagrams, and charts must be included within the page limits for these sections. the applicants should make every effort to be succinct. it is expected that the length of the plan's narrative will depend on the type of the requested instrument and the number of users. to be successful, an application does not have to reach the page limits described here.note: letters of support and bibliography & references cited section are not included in the page limitations.instructions for application submissionnote: effective for due dates on or after january 25, 2023 a data management and sharing plan is not applicable for this foa.the following section supplements the instructions found in the

the requested instrument and an explanation of the need for the instrument to advance research projects of the users and augment research capabilities at the applicant institution. the application's broad, long-term objectives should be stated, concisely describing how access to the instrument will enhance the health-related goals of the research projects and stimulate biomedical research at the applicant institution. this section should be informative to other persons working in the same or related fields and understandable to a scientifically or technically literate reader.note: the project summary/abstract must be no longer than 30 lines of text.project narrative: using no more than two or three sentences, describe the relevance of this research to public health. in this section, be succinct and use plain language that can be understood by a general, lay audience.bibliography & references cited: list only publications that demonstrate the researchers' expertise in operation and usage of the requested instrument or are relevant to research projects, which will be supported by the instrument. references of the research projects section may appear in this section or may be listed at the end of individual research subsections.facilities & other resources: not applicable. do not include an attachment here.equipment: describe the requested instrument by stating its manufacturer, model number, specific features, and accessories. provide a detailed budget breakdown of the main instrument and requested accessories, including tax and import duties, if applicable. an itemized quote from the vendor, with appropriate discounts and warranty terms, is required. the quote must be scanned and combined in a single attachment with the equipment description as part of this upload. as described above in the sf424 cover form, include an explanation of total non-federal funds in this section (if applicable).applications without a quote will be deemed incomplete and returned to the applicant without review.if human, animal, or infectious materials, which could create a potential biohazard, are to be analyzed, funds for accessory containment equipment for the instrument may be requested in the budget.do not describe the need for the instrument or accessories in this section; such narrative should be a part of the justification of need section of the instrumentation plan.other attachments:i) instrumentation plan (in lieu of research plan form)the entire instrumentation plan (with the sections described below) must be saved as a single pdf file - named “instrumentation plan” - and attached via other attachments. organize the instrumentation plan in the specified order as described below, starting each section with the appropriate section heading (i.e., justification of need, technical expertise, research projects, etc.). do not include links to websites for further information. do not include animations/videos.if the requested instrument is under a lease agreement, demonstrate that the instrument is considered state-of-the-art at the time of the application submission (see details in section iv.6 funding restrictions). justify the need for software. all software supported by this program must be integrated in the operation of the instrument or be necessary for the generation of high-quality data from the instrument. depending on the needs of research projects, different configurations of such software may be needed to ensure productive scientific use of the instrument. if such additional software modules are requested (e.g., software configuration for the acquisition of metabolomics data, microscope image acquisition, and control modules), they must be essential for the advancement of research projects of at least three major users. as noted previously, stand-alone workstations, duplicate software items, and software licenses are not allowed.explain why the chosen model and its manufacturer are the most suitable for your user group. preliminary data are not required, though if feasible, can be included to justify the choice of the instrument. especially, if access to a demo instrument is practical, preliminary data are encouraged. provide an inventory of similar instruments existing at your institution, neighboring research institutions, or otherwise accessible; describe why each similar instrument is unavailable or inappropriate for the proposed research. if similar instruments are listed as "unavailable," add a letter to the letters of support section from the instrument manager explaining why the instrument is not available to your user group. include specific documentation on the current usage and downtime of each of these existing instruments in annual hours and a realistic estimate of the projected usage for the requested instrument. you may use tables to clarify the presentation. tables included within this section will count towards the specified page limit.define and justify the accessible user time (aut) for the requested instrument. the aut is the number of annual hours the instrument can be practically used for biomedical research. aut hours may be limited by the times an instrument operator is available (if an operator is required), site or building access schedules, scheduled maintenance, start-up and standardization, and any other factors that take time away from the use of the instrument for biomedical research. more importantly, aut will be limited by the type of the technology requested; some instruments can be and are typically operated 24/7 while other technologies can be used only during regular hours. therefore, justify the aut based on the type of the technology requested and an individual managerial plan at your institution to make clear that the aut corresponds to expected practical full-time use of the instrument at your institution.following the tables, statei. a total estimated usage time by users’ projects in annual hours,ii. the percentage of the aut devoted to all users’ projects’,iii. the percentage of the estimated usage time devoted to major users’ nih-funded projects, andiv. the percentage of the estimated usage time devoted to all users with external research funding.major users with nih research funding should use the instrument at the level of at least 25% of the aut; cumulatively listed users should use the instrument at the level of 75% of the aut.provide an estimated usage time and aut for the requested instrument, considering that both the aut (related to the administration of the instrument) and the expected usage (depending on actual need for the instrument) may be significantly different for different types of instruments and at different institutions.financial plan: submit a specific financial plan for the long-term operation and maintenance of the instrument as such costs are not supported by the s10 program. explain how various operational costs will be met; specifically, costs associated with routine operation and maintenance of the instrument and costs for support staff. enumerate the sources of income such as charge back fee structure, grants, or institutional support. the financial plan must include a table for years 1-5 of operation. for year 1, enter anticipated expenditures and anticipated income, showing how these estimates were derived. for years 2-5, approximate amounts, based on data for year 1, are sufficient. typically, during year one, the maintenance costs are fully covered by a one-year manufacturer's warranty. in subsequent years, costs of maintenance must be considered in the financial plan. include a description of projected changes of the financial plan over the subsequent four years.operation: include salary support of expert personnel that will operate the instrument and oversee routine care and procedures for standardization.maintenance: may include a service contract or funds for parts and local technical personnel who will maintain the instrument (if such personnel are qualified to do so).supplies: include necessary supplies for operating the instrument such as chemicals, cryogenics, and other expendable items.software: include costs for updates/maintenance of software licenses needed for the proper operation of the instrument or additional software for data analysis.anticipated income: enumerate the sources of income, such as any charge back fee structure, grants, or institutional support.ii) letters of supportall letters of support should be combined in a single file named "letters of support" and uploaded as a separate attachment via other attachments. this combined file should include, as applicable:1) s10 grant number; 2) year of award; 3) installation date of the instrument; 4) pd/pi's name; 5) generic name of instrument; 6) instrument status: (active (instrument in use), pending (order placed, but instrument not delivered, instrument received but not installed or not calibrated for general use), upgraded (or replaced), not available (sold, decommissioned, transferred)); (if the instrument is currently non-functional, provide a succinct explanation of the instrument status immediately following this table.) 7) actual usage time (actual total time in hours per year the instrument was used for research; if the instrument has been installed less than a year ago, the hours can be extrapolated for an estimate of hours per full year) 8) maintenance agreement active (warranty in place), in-house (or self-insured), none (fee for service, pending), not available (no longer supported by manufacturer); and 9) publications: enter the number of research publications that cite the s10 award or have been linked with the s10 award in my ncbi. the number of reported publications should be verified in the nih reporter. (if there are no publications for any of the previously awarded s10-awarded instruments provide an explanation immediately following this table.)sf424(r&r) senior/key person profileall instructions in the sf424 (r&r) application guide must be followed.include the profiles of the pd/pi, major users, minor users, and technical personnel, as applicable.this foa requires the attachment of current & pending support for the pd/pi at the time of application submission. if pd/pi has no research grant or any other research support, state “none” in the form.phs 398 cover page supplementall instructions in the sf424 (r&r) application guide must be followed.appendix:appendix materials are not allowed for this foa..3. unique entity identifier and system for award management (sam)see part 1. section iii.1 for information regarding the requirement for obtaining a unique entity identifier and for completing and maintaining active registrations in system for award management (sam), nato commercial and government entity (ncage) code (if applicable), era commons, and grants.gov4. submission dates and timespart i. overview information contains information about key dates and times. applicants are encouraged to submit applications before the due date to ensure they have time to make any application corrections that might be necessary for successful submission. when a submission date falls on a weekend or federal holiday, the application deadline is automatically extended to the next business day.organizations must submit applications to grants.gov (the online portal to find and apply for grants across all federal agencies). applicants must then complete the submission process by tracking the status of the application in the era commons, nih’s electronic system for grants administration. nih and grants.gov systems check the application against many of the application instructions upon submission. errors must be corrected and a changed/corrected application must be submitted to grants.gov on or before the application due date and time. if a changed/corrected application is submitted after the deadline, the application will be considered late. applications that miss the due date and time are subjected to the nih policy on late application submission.applicants are responsible for viewing their application before the due date in the era commons to ensure accurate and successful submission.information on the submission process and a definition of on-time submission are provided in the sf424 (r&r) application guide.5. intergovernmental review (e.o. 12372)this initiative is not subject to intergovernmental review.6. funding restrictionsall nih awards are subject to the terms and conditions, cost principles, and other considerations described in the nih grants policy statement.pre-award costs are not allowable.under the s10 mechanism, funding requests are limited to the purchase cost of the instrument only. support for technical personnel, service contracts, extended warranties, software (except as defined in part 2, section i), and supplies are not allowable. cost sharing towards the purchase of the instrument is not required and any institutional funds contributed to the costs of the purchase of the instrument are voluntary. if the amount of funds requested does not cover the total cost of the instrument, the application should describe the proposed source(s) of funding to cover the balance of the cost of the instrument and document their availability in a letter signed by an appropriate institutional official. note that any voluntarily committed cost will be noted in the notice of the award and the institution will be held to the commitment and reporting requirements.this program does not provide facilities and administrative (f&a) costs or support for construction or alterations or renovations. matching funds are not required. however, commitment of an appropriate level of institutional support, to ensure the associated sustaining infrastructure, is expected and should be described. the appropriate grant will be awarded for a period of one year and is not renewable.applicants proposing the purchase of an instrument that the institution is planning to lease prior to an award are urged to consult with their institutional sponsored projects office and the nih grant management office (see section vii for the contact information) regarding the applicable nih policy prior to executing the leasing agreement. if the leasing agreement was executed more than one year prior to submission of the big application, the applicant must provide a strong justification for the requested federal funds. this justification must demonstrate that the leased instrument is considered state-of-the-art at the time of submission - appropriate award adjustments may be necessary. execution of a purchase order or agreement, making a down payment or other formal commitment to purchase the equipment prior to award will automatically eliminate an applicant from eligibility for an award.7. other submission requirements and informationapplications must be submitted electronically following the instructions described in the sf424 (r&r) application guide. paper applications will not be accepted.applicants must complete all required registrations before the application due date. section iii. eligibility information contains information about registration.for assistance with your electronic application or for more information on the electronic submission process, visit how to apply – application guide. if you encounter a system issue beyond your control that threatens your ability to complete the submission process on-time, you must follow the dealing with system issues guidance. for assistance with application submission, contact the application submission contacts in section vii.important reminders:all pd(s)/pi(s) must include their era commons id in the credential field of the senior/key person profile form. failure to register in the commons and to include a valid pd/pi commons id in the credential field will prevent the successful submission of an electronic application to nih. see section iii of this foa for information on registration requirements.the applicant organization must ensure that the unique entity identifier (duns number or uei as required) provided on the application is the same number used in the organization’s profile in the era commons and for the system for award management. additional information may be found in the sf424 (r&r) application guide.see more tips for avoiding common errors.upon receipt, applications will be evaluated for completeness and compliance with application instructions by the center for scientific review and responsiveness by components of participating organizations, nih. applications that are incomplete, non-compliant, and/or non-responsive will not be reviewed.post submission materialsapplicants are required to follow the instructions for post-submission materials, as described in the policy. any instructions provided here are in addition to the instructions in the policy.1. criteriaonly the review criteria described below will be considered in the review process. applications submitted to the nih in support of the nih mission are evaluated for scientific and technical merit through the nih peer review system.overall benefitreviewers will provide an overall benefit score to reflect their assessment of the likelihood that the requested instrument will exert a sustained, powerful
