research on women's health (orwh)nih institutes, centers, and offices participating in the social, behavioral, and economic impacts of covid-19 in vulnerable and health disparity populations initiative are issuing this notice of special interest (nosi) to highlight interest in research to strengthen the understanding and response to the coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) pandemic and help us prepare more effectively for future public health emergencies. while research related to the direct clinical effects of covid-19 are supported by other funding opportunities, there are additional urgent public health needs, particularly in populations who experience health disparities and in vulnerable populations. the purpose of this notice is to 1) emphasize the roles and impacts of interventions, particularly those under the umbrella of digital health, as well as community-engaged and multi-level interventions in healthcare settings to address access, reach, delivery, engagement, effectiveness, scalability, and sustainability of services that are utilized during and following the pandemic, and 2) encourage the leveraging of existing large-scale data sources with broad population coverage to improve prediction of various mitigation efforts (including vaccinations, masking, and physical distancing to inform the public health response) on transmission reduction and on social and economic impacts, and assess the downstream health and healthcare access effects, with an emphasis on underserved and vulnerable populations. additionally, the use of large-scale data sources to study the indirect health impacts of the pandemic and subsequent social and economic changes is needed to understand the costs and benefits of various covid-19 mitigation strategies.backgroundacross the lifespan, the covid-19 pandemic has resulted in behavioral, social, and economic changes that impact health. adoption and adherence to prevention and mitigation strategies have been uneven across the u.s. population due to issues related to trust in health systems, economic circumstances that limit access to paid leave or other accommodations to support testing and vaccination, conflicting information in the media, and challenges in sustaining long term adherence. repeated surges of infections with sars-cov-2 over a prolonged period and with widespread regions affected, has resulted in profound secondary impacts including economic shocks that produce disparate levels of stress-induced poor health across socioeconomic and regional strata. early data reveal exacerbations of symptoms among individuals with pre-existing health conditions and related comorbidities and a reduction in healthy behaviors that promote individual wellness. these adverse effects are compounded by disruptions in the provision and access to healthcare, including access to allied health clinicians, such as therapists and visiting nurses.of particular concern are the effects of the pandemic on populations that experience health disparities* (racial and ethnic minorities, socioeconomically disadvantaged populations, underserved rural populations, and sexual and gender minorities) and other populations with medical or social vulnerabilities. the latter includes people who are: part of communities with low adoption of public health mitigation measures (e.g., vaccination uptake, mask use, physical distancing), living on tribal lands or reservations, in congregate housing, community-dwelling older adults, homeless, incarcerated or involved with the criminal justice system, detainees in immigration centers, as well as people who are part of migrant communities. other vulnerable groups specific to the covid-19 pandemic are medical personnel with direct patient care, other medical support staff, home health aides, as well as family and informal caregivers, emergency responders, and frontline workers in essential businesses or services. additional vulnerable populations include pregnant women, children, uninsured individuals, persons with cognitive impairment or dementia, people experiencing substance use disorder or severe mental illness, or people with visual, hearing, communication, or mobility impairment.research in the u.s. confirms consistent health disparities by race and ethnicity, with african american, hispanic/latino, american indian/alaska native, and native hawaiian/pacific islander people experiencing a greater covid-19 burden than white persons. reports by geographic locations indicate that covid-19 cases are substantially greater in economically disadvantaged census tracts. excess deaths above and beyond covid-19 are also disproportionately distributed among african americans, latinos, and american indian/alaska native populations. covid-19 also disproportionately affects other vulnerable populations such as frontline health care workers and first responders, and all workers with direct patient contact as well as people living in communities with low adoption of public health mitigation measures. a sex and gender lens to the covid-19 pandemic is an important consideration as well given that women are overrepresented among public-facing essential workers (e.g., women comprise more than 70% of healthcare workers globally) and are usually responsible for the majority of caregiving in a household.the pandemic has altered health needs and the delivery of services. there are both new and worsening experiences of illness, particularly related to mental health as well as alcohol and drug use, but also related to chronic conditions. in many areas, the existing healthcare workforce cannot meet the current and anticipated needs. simultaneously, adoption of digital health technologies delivered online across a variety of platforms for addressing health and disease management have rapidly accelerated, however with uncertain reach to populations that experience health disparities and other vulnerable groups. digital health incorporates mobile health (mhealth), telemedicine/telehealth, and health information technology (mobile phones, wearable sensors, internet platforms, and electronic health records) with biological, social, and behavioral data. to be successful in the digital health interventions space, researchers must acquire and leverage partnerships with digital health developers and existing well-established digital health delivery platforms, so that the research follows a deployment-focused model of services design and testing. whether health care is delivered via digital health technologies or in person, interventions are needed to re-engage patients in care after service disruptions, and facilitate timely assessment, diagnosis, and treatment for chronic health conditions. interventions are also needed to address covid-19 related stress and burnout among healthcare workers.public health needs exacerbated by the pandemic may also require interventions outside of the traditional healthcare setting. community interventions are those which are delivered outside of traditional healthcare settings, such as places of residence, community-based organizations, child welfare and human service settings, workplaces, businesses, stores and restaurants, schools, criminal justice settings, faith-based organizations, public works and facilities, recreational settings, and green spaces. multi-level interventions that go beyond addressing individual-level determinants, to address interpersonal, family, organizational, neighborhood, and community-level factors are particularly important to effectively address the social, behavioral, and economic consequences of the pandemic on health. (see the nimhd research framework for examples of health determinants at different levels of influence).providing an evidence base for effective policymaking to mitigate the negative health impacts of a pandemic requires an understanding of how institutional changes at different levels (e.g., firm, national, state, local, etc.) intended to manage viral spread influences health and health behaviors across diverse populations and regions. efforts to improve mitigation practices and manage associated economic and health impacts will be enhanced if researchers have access to integrated established behavioral, economic, and public health datasets covering large populations to produce generalizable results. existing datasets offer the advantage of continuous and historical data before and after the pandemic emerged, thereby facilitating analyses of the pandemic response and impacts. however, integrating diverse data sets also presents challenges, since many relevant datasets are discrete, not readily accessible or interoperable, and may lag in their data reporting. additionally, there may be a need to improve the usefulness of existing data resources characterized by sparse data sampling by introducing novel data collection techniques to gather more temporally dense, real-time data. nih has current investments in both interventions and social/population science which both model the kinds of research that are supported and can help inform novel research questions to address gaps in understanding. for example, the duration and impact of the pandemic are directly affected by the adoption, implementation, distribution, and ongoing adherence to public health mitigation efforts which include behaviors related to vaccination, mask wearing, physical distancing, and hand washing. research on adherence to these preventive behaviors and to understand how personal and social factors promote or impede adherence will be key for developing and communicating effective public health recommendations for families, firms and government. further, mitigation efforts may have indirect impacts that also must be understood to inform public health decision making in the future. reduced rates of other respiratory infections due to mask wearing, changes in social connection, and job loss/reduction resulting in food insecurity and increased stress are emerging as examples of risks and benefits that may be weighed in a cost-benefit analysis of various mitigation strategies.understanding the multifaceted impacts of the covid-19 pandemic, and public health interventions that mitigate risk and promote resilience in high-risk populations will help improve long-term response to the pandemic and prepare more effectively for future public health emergencies. in addition, tackling the complex drivers of health disparities requires strong partnerships between researchers, community organizations, health service providers, public health agencies, policymakers, and other stakeholders to ensure that relevant, culturally and contextually appropriate research is conducted, and more importantly, that findings can be translated into sustainable community and system-level changes that promote health equity.consideration of particularly vulnerable groups and populations with health disparities are critical to addressing the public health needs of the pandemic.research objectivesto strengthen the understanding and response to social, behavioral, and economic impacts of the covid-19 pandemic, nih institutes, centers, and offices participating in this nosi are encouraging the submission of applications to address the following areas of scientific interest focused on covid-19 health-related outcomes or behaviors with particular emphasis on populations with health disparities and vulnerable populations:across topic areas, projects that involve collaborations with relevant community partners, including but not limited to health service providers and systems; state and local public health agencies or other governmental agencies such as housing or transportation; criminal justice systems; school systems, patient or consumer advocacy groups; community-based organizations, and faith-based organizations, are strongly encouraged.investigators interested in responding to this nosi are strongly encouraged to consult the scientific/research contact(s) provided prior to the application due date so that nih can provide technical assistance on whether the proposed project meets the goals and mission of the institute, whether it addresses one or more high priority research areas (particularly in the context of rapidly changing landscape of covid-19 related research), and to aid in the selection of the most appropriate foa.areas that are low priority for institutes/centers participating in this nosi:data harmonizationthe nih is dedicated to advancing science by improving the yield and impact of its research portfolio. one way to accomplish this is to encourage investigators to use a common set of tools and resources to facilitate the collection of common data elements (cdes) or, in the case of existing data/records apply common constructs. nih has worked with relevant communities to develop and provide access to tools and resources that can improve consistency of data collection. nih strongly encourages investigators collecting data to use these resources as they select covid-related instruments for their proposed studies and devise programs to construct research data files. this is particularly important for efforts to rapidly assess the needs and impact of covid-19 across different population groups, particularly vulnerable populations. recipients of awards under this notice are encouraged to submit their covid-19 specific instruments for inclusion into these resource sharing sites (see data collection tools & resources form for dr2 and phenx repositories).the nih public health emergency and disaster research response (dr2) includes covid-19 related survey instruments and additional information such as the domains assessed, protocols, and a wide array of data collection tools and resources used in other public health emergencies and disasters.the phenx toolkit, hosts a collection of covid-19 related item-module protocols drawn from the surveys listed in dr2. in addition, the phenx toolkit has a large collection of well-established and vetted phenotypic measurement protocols, including its newly released social determinants of health collections. these protocols are suitable for inclusion in covid-19-related studies, enabling data harmonization across studies.data sharingapplicants, whether collecting new data or using existing data as part of proposed research are encouraged to submit a data sharing plan. projects collecting data should use best practices in data sharing to accelerate the scientific community’s ability to advance knowledge about the social, behavioral, economic and health impacts of covid-19. as articulated in the nih strategic plan for data science, nih seeks to leverage its role as a funding agency to encourage rapid, open sharing of data, and greater harmonization of scientific efforts. researchers are encouraged to ensure that the data resources that they produce meet the standard for being fair—findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable, and further elaborated upon by force 11. some tools to help researchers in the digital cloud environment have also been generated by the nih data commons. nih strongly encourages use of nih-supported, domain-specific data repositories as a first choice for storing data and making it accessible (see nlm data sharing resources). in instances where captured/re-used data is not directly sharable by the applicant, plans for providing access protocols and programs to allow third-party researchers to replicate proposed research data files are necessary to meet data sharing requirements. specifically, this includes information describing the data source and how any investigator can apply for data access, computer code used to convert data from the capture source into research data files, explanations of any variables constructed by the investigators, and other relevant information required to assist the use of data from the source for replication studies. nih requires researchers and publishers to make their covid-19 publications immediately accessible in pubmed central.this guidance does not replace institutes' and centers'. for example, nimh applicants are still expected to abide by the data sharing expectations in not-mh-19-033 and the common data element expectations in not-mh-20-067.*this phrase is intended to refer to individuals who belong to a “health disparity population” as defined in section 464z-3(d)(1) of the public health service act, 42 u.s.c. 285t(d)(1): “a population is a health disparity population if, as determined by the director of the institute after consultation with the director of the agency for healthcare research and quality, there is a significant disparity in the overall rate of disease incidence, prevalence, morbidity, mortality, or survival rates in the population as compared to the health status of the general population.”
