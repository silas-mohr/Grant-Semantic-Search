of dental and craniofacial research (nidcr)national cancer institute (nci)this notice of special interest (nosi) encourages studies of the endocannabinoid system (ecs) and its roles in brain health and acute and chronic disease, substance use, and substance use disorder (sud). the desired outcomes of research will be a mechanistic understanding of how cannabinoids and manipulation of the ecs can elicit both therapeutic and deleterious effects as well as the role of cannabinoids and ecs in symptom management.backgroundthe ecs, which is expressed throughout the vertebrate central nervous system and periphery, is composed of three key components: 1) the endocannabinoids, 2) their synthetic and metabolic enzymes, and 3) the cannabinoid receptors. in addition to the known endocannabinoids, there have been additional endogenous ligands discovered, but their functions at the receptors are largely unknown. endocannabinoids and cannabinoids exert their actions by binding to membrane bound cannabinoid receptors, classified as type 1 and type 2 (cb1 and cb2). endocannabinoids are produced and released on demand and act via their major receptors to impact a diverse array of cellular signal transduction pathways. as a retrograde signaling system that sends activity-modifying signals back to the initiating cells, there is a particular state-dependent aspect of the ecs that enables it to act as a broad-spectrum modulator of physiological processes. numerous studies have shown analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects resulting from activation of cb1 and cb2, which have implicated the ecs in the body’s ability to adapt in response to perturbations. although engaging the ecs may be adaptive and promote physiological resilience and restoration, dysregulation of the ecs by exogenous cannabinoid use may have deleterious consequences. elucidating the roles of the ecs in disease states and sequelae as well as normative functions, and the consequences of cannabis use on the ecs will inform public health.research objectivesstudies conducted in various biological model systems have implicated engagement of ecs in central nervous system development, neural synaptic organization, and plasticity, and in cellular responses to injury or disease. these studies have been used as a basis for supporting the therapeutic uses of cannabis. however, conflicting clinical reports suggest both positive and negative effects of cannabinoids. as a widespread modulator system that impacts the functions of various tissues and organs, alterations in the ecs (either hypo- or hyper- activation) may disrupt molecular networks that are critical for physiological stabilization. given these conflicting views, this nosi encourages research to explore and validate roles of the ecs under physio-normative and disease conditions, including their sequelae, and the impacts of recreational or medicinal cannabinoid use (acute and/or chronic).the research supported by this nosi includes, but is not limited to: 1) research to identify the causal mechanisms underlying therapeutic benefits of cannabinoids and the ecs; 2) studies utilizing pharmacological, immunological, or genetic approaches to manipulate specific elements of the ecs; 3) research to establish biological relevance and translational validity of findings using biological models (cell/tissue, biological specimens, or postmortem brain tissue from treated or untreated sud patients); and 4) research to investigate the role of cannabinoids and the ecs in treatment-related conditions. this nosi also encourages research examining the longitudinal effects of cannabinoid use in order to describe biological mechanisms associated with persistent ecs dysregulation. key in this regard is the collection of data on parameters such as dose, frequency and duration of exposure.national institute on drug abuse (nida)nida supports mechanistic research on the biological effects of cannabinoids, both endogenous and exogenous in nature. the roles of the ecs in drug use, the therapeutic potential of ecs modulation in the context of substance use and/or sud, as well as comorbidity of sud and hiv infection are of particular interest. although engaging the ecs may be adaptive and promote physiological resilience and restoration, basic and human research are encouraged to study the relationships between alteration of ecs functions and modulation of nervous and immune systems. these studies should inform molecular targets and/or ligand development for functional recovery and symptom management.national institute of dental and craniofacial research (nidcr)nidcr supports rigorously designed basic science, translational and clinical research studies, including longitudinal studies, investigating the causal mechanisms that link ecs changes to the onset, progression, management or resolution of dental, oral and craniofacial diseases. research studies may investigate ecs-modulated behavioral and systemic changes that can directly and substantially impact the prevention, diagnosis or prognosis of dental, oral or craniofacial diseases (primary outcomes). for any application that includes delivering ecs-related products to humans, investigators must contact the u.s. food and drug administration (fda) prior to applying regarding whether an investigational new drug (ind) application is necessary for the proposed clinical research. nidcr does not accept clinical trials submitted through a parent r01 or r21. when applying, investigators should reference this nosi and select an activity among those listed in this nosi that includes nidcr among the participating ics.national cancer institute (nci)ncis mission is to lead, conduct, and support cancer research across the nation to advance scientific knowledge and help all people live longer, healthier lives. nci is interested in supporting clinical trial research to investigate the impact of cannabinoids and the ecs in cancer treatment-related symptoms, such as pain, fatigue, insomnia, nausea and vomiting, diarrhea, mucositis, and poor appetite. applicants interested in submitting cancer clinical trial research should use one of the following funding opportunity announcements: for r01 submissions use par-21-03, “cancer prevention and control clinical trials grant program” and for r21 submissions par-22-216, “nci clinical and translational exploratory/developmental studies.” applicants interested in preclinical research on the role of cannabinoids and the ecs in cancer treatment-related symptoms should apply directly to nci nosi entitled “notice of special interest (nosi): basic mechanisms of cannabis and cannabinoid action in cancer,” not-ca-22-085 rather than to this trans-nih
