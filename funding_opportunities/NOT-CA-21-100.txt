u54) to one of the institutions serving underserved health disparity populations and underrepresented students (isupss); see budget below for details. each cohort will be comprised of primarily extramural surgeons. nci intramural surgeons are also eligible. only one candidate per p30, one isups candidate per cpache u54 program, and one candidate per intramural nci branch may be nominated to apply by the center director or branch chief per cohort.curriculumnci will sponsor quarterly professional development symposia to include grant writing seminars, content area mentoring, scientific methods curriculum and more.diversity, equity, and inclusionadditional announcements of the program to underrepresented minority surgeon populations will be made through collaboration with external organizations, such as professional surgical associations. diversity, equity, and inclusion should also be a factor in recruiting mentors for the participants to ensure that the essp community reflects these values.office of research on women’s health (orwh)the mission of the orwh is to advance research for the health of women and to recruit, retain, and advance women in biomedical careers. advancing science for the health of women requires a well-trained, diverse, and robust workforce, which is the engine of scientific progress. in support of this initiative, orwh is particularly interested in applications from underrepresented surgeon populations including women. the 2019-2023 nih wide strategic plan for the health of women “advancing science for the health of women” identifies guiding principles and objectives to promote training and careers that increase gender diversity in the biomedical research workforce at all career levels including early stage scientists as they transition to independent research careers and leadership positions. (https://www.nih.gov/women/strategicplan)essp-participant milestonessecond and third years of funding will be dependent on achieving sufficient progress towards milestones that are appropriate for the participant’s career stage. these milestones include: 1) acceptance of either an abstract at a society meeting or a manuscript by a journal; 2) submission of an nih grant application; 3) submission of a non-nih grant application; 4) participation in all professional development sessions offered by the essp. intramural physician-scientist early investigators will be expected to submit an internal nih proposal and a non-nih grant.evaluation metricsthe pilot program will be evaluated annually for outcomes, by administering participant surveys, conducting exit interviews of participants completing the essp, and collecting academic activity from participants and alumni.application and submission informationapplications to support extramural candidates must be submitted using the
