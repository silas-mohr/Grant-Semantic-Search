additional information on eligibility.the purpose of the research enhancement award program (reap) for health professional schools and graduate schools is to support small scale research grants at institutions that do not receive substantial funding from the nih, with an emphasis on providing biomedical research experiences primarily for health professional, undergraduate and graduate students and enhancing the research environment at applicant institutions.eligible institutions must award baccalaureate or advanced science degrees and have received no more than $6 million dollars per year of nih support (in both direct and f&a/indirect costs) in 4 of the last 7 fiscal years. for institutions composed of multiple schools and colleges, the $6 million funding limit is based on the amount of nih funding received by all the schools and colleges within the institution as a whole.help determining the organization funding level can be found here or https://grants.nih.gov/grants/funding/r15.htm.not applicableall applications are due by 5:00 pm local time of applicant organization. all types of non-aids applications allowed for this funding opportunity announcement are due on the listed date(s).applicants are encouraged to apply early to allow adequate time to make any corrections to errors found in the application during the submission process by the due date.not applicableit is critical that applicants follow the instructions in the research (r) instructions in the sf424 (r&r) application guide,except where instructed to do otherwise (in this foa or in a notice from nih guide for grants and contracts ).conformance to all requirements (both in the application guide and the foa) is required and strictly enforced. applicants must read and follow all application instructions in the application guide as well as any program-specific instructions noted in section iv. when the program-specific instructions deviate from those in the application guide, follow the program-specific instructions.applications that do not comply with these instructions may be delayed or not accepted for review.there are several options available to submit your application through grants.gov to nih and department of health and human services partners. you must use one of these submission options to access the application forms for this opportunity.)the national institutes of health (nih) is continuing to make a special effort to stimulate research at educational institutions that provide baccalaureate and/or advanced degrees for a significant number of the nation's research institutions that have not been major recipients of nih support. since fiscal year (fy) 1985 congressional appropriations for the nih have included funds for this initiative, known as the academic research enhancement award (area) program that was intended to focus on undergraduate institutions (par-21-155). to complement the area program, this funding opportunity announcement (foa) specifically supports eligible health professional schools and graduate schools to provide research experiences to health professional, undergraduate and/or graduate students pursuing biomedical or behavioral research.the three objectives of this foa are to: (1) provide support for meritorious research; (2) strengthen the research environment at these institutions; and (3) give health professional, undergraduate and/or graduate students an opportunity to gain significant biomedical research experience through active involvement in the research. for the purposes of this foa, health professional schools and colleges are accredited institutions that provide education and training leading to a health professional degree, including but not limited to: bsn, msn, dnp, md, dds, do, pharmd, dvm, od, dpt, dc, nd, dpm, mot, otd, dpt, ms-slp, cscd, slpd, aud, mspo, msat, and mph. eligible health professional schools/colleges may include schools or colleges of nursing, medicine, dentistry, osteopathy, pharmacy, veterinary medicine, public health, optometry, allied health, chiropractics, naturopathy, podiatry, rehabilitation medicine, physical therapy, orthotics & prosthetics, kinesiology, occupational therapy and psychology. accreditation must be provided by a body approved for such purpose by the secretary of education.the reap program will enable qualified scientists to receive support for small-scale research projects. it is anticipated that investigators supported under the reap program will benefit from the opportunity to conduct independent research; that the grantee institution will benefit from a research environment strengthened through reap grants; and that students at recipient institutions will benefit from exposure to and participation in scientific research in the biomedical sciences so that they consider careers in biomedical research. the reap foa emphasizes the engagement and inclusion of health professional, undergraduates and/or graduate students in research. since diversity strengthens the research environment, reap projects are encouraged to recruit and include students from diverse backgrounds, including those from groups underrepresented in the biomedical research workforce. (see not-od-20-031 and not-od-22-019) .the research project must involve health professional, undergraduate and/or graduate students and the research team must be composed primarily of health professional, undergraduate and/or graduate students. student involvement in the research project may include participation in the design of experiments and controls, collection and analysis of data, execution and troubleshooting of experiments, participation in research meetings, and discussion of future directions. when applicable, it is highly desirable that student participation also include presentation at local and/or national meetings, publication of journal articles, and collaborative interactions. the reap is a research grant program, not a training or fellowship program. as such, applications should not include training plans such as didactic training or non-research activities relating to professional development. this foa does not provide support for research at undergraduate-focused institutions, and investigators from those institutions should apply to par-21-155 academic research enhancement award for undergraduate-focused institutions (r15 clinical trial not allowed). additional information on r15 programs can be found at: nih research enhancement award (r15)a reap application submitted to this foa may include other investigators, such as collaborators or consultants, or other individuals such as high school students, post baccalaureate participants, postdoctoral fellows, or clinical fellows. however, involvement of such individuals does not fulfill the goal to engage health professional, undergraduate and/or graduate students in eligible environments to research.this foa will support basic and/or human subjects research but will not support research meeting the nih definition of a clinical trial. applicants are strongly encouraged to refer to nih guidance on clinical trials (clinical trial requirements for grants and contracts) or consult with nih staff before selecting a funding opportunity announcement. investigators wishing to propose a clinical trial should apply to the research enhancement award program (reap) for health professional schools and graduate schools (r15 clinical trial required) funding opportunity (par-21-357).in addition, applicants are encouraged to consult the frequently asked

submitted to the nih in support of the nih mission are evaluated for scientific and technical merit through the nih peer review system.for this particular announcement, note the following:this foa has three objectives: (1) provide support for meritorious research at health professional or graduate institutions or institutional components; (2) strengthen the research environment at these institutions/components; and (3) give health professional, undergraduate and/or graduate students an opportunity to gain significant biomedical research experience through active involvement in the research.the scientific foundation for the proposed research should be established using preliminary data (if available) and/or published data. although preliminary data are not required for an r15 application, they may be included if available.health professional, graduate, and/or undergraduate students in health professional schools as well as graduate and/or undergraduate students in graduate schools, pursuing biomedical or behavioral research, must be included in the research team. any combination of health professional, graduate and/or graduate students from pis’ institutions is allowed on the research team.reviewers will provide an overall impact score to reflect their assessment of the likelihood for the project to make important scientific contributions to the research field(s) involved, to provide research opportunities to health professional, undergraduate and/or graduate students by engaging them in primary research activities, and to strengthen the research environment of the institution, in consideration of the following review criteria and additional review criteria (as applicable for the project proposed).scored review criteriareviewers will consider each of the review criteria below in relation to the reap program objectives and give a separate score for each. an application does not need to be strong in all categories to be judged as a high impact reap application. for example, a solid and interesting scientific research project that is not by its nature innovative or paradigm-shifting, and includes a good plan to engage health professional, graduate, and/or undergraduate students in primary research may be considered a strong, high impact reap application.significancedoes the project address an important problem or a critical barrier to progress in the field? is the prior research that serves as the key support for the proposed project rigorous? if the aims of the project are achieved,if the aims of the project are achieved, will the
