december 2, 2022pa-20-272 - administrative supplements to existing nih grants and cooperative agreements (parent admin supp clinical trial optional)national institute on drug abuse (nida)this notice of special interest (nosi) invites requests for administrative supplements to existing nih grants and cooperative agreements that will translate findings between epidemiology and prevention intervention research related to substance use and addiction. successful and rapid translation requires active partnership between epidemiology and prevention science, creating cross-disciplinary teams with diverse scientific perspectives. oftentimes, this translation can take many years or never occur. epidemiology projects may be designed with the intention of informing prevention, but without specific aims or collaborations in place to move forward with translation. similarly, prevention intervention studies may generate new hypotheses about substance use development or etiology, but these hypotheses may remain untested without collaboration between the prevention team and epidemiological researchers.the goal of this nosi is to incentivize cross-disciplinary collaboration by inviting administrative supplement requests that will either a) extend an epidemiological project into prevention intervention or b) extend a prevention intervention project into epidemiological research. the focus of proposed supplements should be on the translation from one field to the other, and additional research team members should be incorporated as necessary to bring expertise across both epidemiology and prevention intervention research. the proposed supplemental activities must be within the scope of the parent award.applicants with parent grants that address the epidemiology of substance use may submit applications to apply the research findings to any aspect of prevention intervention research. the activities in the supplement request may include developing partnerships with organizations that would deliver the intervention outside of a research context, working with a community advisory panel to identify or adapt key components of existing interventions or implementation strategies, preliminary feasibility, efficacy, or implementation studies as appropriate. of priority are supplement requests that move beyond planning and include intervention delivery/testing.applicants with parent grants studying substance use prevention interventions may submit proposals to apply the research findings to epidemiology. the parent grant may be investigating any aspect of prevention intervention research, including adaptation of existing interventions, development of a novel intervention, efficacy or effectiveness testing or implementation research. additionally, parent grant interventions may be designed to prevent substance use initiation, escalation of use and/or prevention of addiction among those already using. the activities in the supplement request may include additional studies to test hypotheses related to substance use etiology, questions of measurement, including measurement of environmental or structural factors, the development of methods to better capture information required for prevention, and the partnership with affected communities to develop and design epidemiological research relevant to their prevention needs.for parent projects of either kind, applications that do not address translational research questions will be considered non-responsive for this initiative. applicants are strongly encouraged to discuss their application with a program officer prior to submission.application and submission informationapplications for this initiative must be submitted using the following opportunity or its subsequent reissued equivalent.all instructions in the sf424 (r&r) application guide and pa-20-272 must be followed, with the following additions:please direct all inquiries to:alexa romberg, phd prevention research branch national institute on drug abuse (nida) telephone: 301-435-0264 email: alexa.romberg@nih.govkeva collier kidemu, md epidemiology research branch national institute on drug abuse (nida) telephone: 301-402-1881 email: keva.collierkidemu@nih.govweekly toc for this announcement nih funding opportunities and noticesnote: for help accessing pdf, rtf, ms word, excel, powerpoint, audio or video files, see help downloading files.
