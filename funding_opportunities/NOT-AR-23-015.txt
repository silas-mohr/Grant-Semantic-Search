supplements to niams-funded t32 training grants to better incorporate pain related research in rheumatic, skin and musculoskeletal diseases workforce developmentnational institute of arthritis and musculoskeletal and skin diseases (niams)the purpose of this announcement is to notify the research community that the national institute of arthritis and musculoskeletal and skin diseases (niams) is interested in receiving urgent competitive revision and administrative supplement applications focused on cutting-edge pain research in rheumatic, skin, and musculoskeletal diseases.backgroundthis announcement is consistent with the nih’s helping to end addiction long-term (heal) initiative to speed scientific solutions to the national opioid public health crisis. more than 25 million americans suffer from daily chronic pain, a highly debilitating medical condition that is complex and difficult to manage. a large proportion of the cases are due to chronic inflammatory and musculoskeletal conditions such as arthritis and chronic low back pain. in recent decades, there has been an over reliance on the prescription of opioids for chronic pain despite their poor ability to improve function. this contributed to a significant and alarming epidemic of opioid overdose deaths and addictions. innovative scientific approaches to improve understanding, measurement, prevention, and treatment of chronic pain in rheumatic, skin and musculoskeletal diseases are urgently needed.many of the diseases and conditions covered by the niams mission areas cause pain, disability, or disfigurement. some of these diseases and conditions are very common, while some are rare, affecting only a few thousand people worldwide. pain, both acute and chronic, is one of the most important symptoms affecting mobility and quality of life for patients. yet, the mechanisms of pain, and measures and treatment options that can prevent and alleviate pain caused by these diseases are not clearly understood and remain a critical knowledge gap within the niams mission. therefore, there is a need to accelerate research into underlying mechanisms of pain and advance cutting-edge pain research in rheumatic, skin, and musculoskeletal diseases.research objectivesniams is soliciting applications for urgent competitive revisions or administrative supplements to active awards that include or propose to extend to pain research. applicants may propose to supplement a parent awards focused on pain or to address/expand a component related to pain in a biomedical and/or health-related behavioral parent research study.applications in response to this nosi should be aligned with one or more of the following goals:goal a: generate supporting evidence towards a future innovative study or new scientific direction in pain research in rheumatic, skin, and musculoskeletal diseases.goal b: expand rheumatic, skin, and musculoskeletal disease pain research capacity (cohorts, technologies or data) beyond current research base/collaborators.areas of scientific interest related to these goals include:applications may extend beyond these areas of scientific interest but must include a strong justification.budgetniams intends to make multiple awards based on available funds. application budgets are limited to no more than the amount of the current year's direct cost budget, or $350,000 direct costs (whichever is less), exclusive of consortium f&a costs. the budget must reflect the actual needs of the proposed project.active awards with project end dates in fy 2024 or later are eligible. the award may not be in a terminal no-cost extension or entering a no-cost extension in fy 2023. all grant awards made by niams are eligible for this initiative except for the following mechanisms: f30, f31, f32, f33, t32, and r13.investigators are strongly encouraged to contact their niams scientific program officer before preparing an application. all questions related to this nosi can be addressed to niams_pain@mail.nih.gov.application and submission informationapplications in response to this nosi must be submitted using one of the two following targeted funding opportunities, or its subsequent reissued equivalents:within scope: an applicant that is proposing work that is within scope (e.g., expansion of existing specific aims) of the parent grant should apply to the administrative supplement announcement, pa-20-272. for funding consideration, applicants must include “not-ar-23-015” (without quotation marks) in the agency routing identifier field (box 4b) of the sf424 r&r form.change in scope: work that is considered a revision of the parent grant, i.e., expanding the scope with a new specific aim, should apply to the urgent competitive revision announcement, pa-23-044. for funding consideration, applicants must include “not-ar-23-015” (without quotation marks) in the agency routing identifier field (box 4b) of the sf424 r&r form. please note that expanding the scope must be consistent with the nih’s helping to end addiction long-term (heal) initiative to speed scientific solutions to the national opioid public health crisis.when developing applications in response to this nosi, all instructions in the sf424 (r&r) application guide and pa-20-272 or pa-23-044 must be followed, with the following additions:review processapplications will be evaluated for scientific and technical merit by an appropriate internal review panel convened by niams staff, in accordance with the review criteria specified in the foa as
