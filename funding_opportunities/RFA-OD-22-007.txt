of co-occurring conditions across the lifespan to understand down syndrome (include) project seeks to improve health and quality-of-life for individuals with down syndrome. this foa requests research to address critical health needs for individuals across the lifespan with down syndrome. the overarching emphasis is on the acquisition of knowledge that can be translated into new, enhanced, or tailored therapies for co-occurring conditions in individuals with down syndrome. to date, clinical trials for down syndrome have been extremely limited and have primarily focused on improving cognition, memory and adaptive functioning. moreover, people with down syndrome are often excluded from trials of potentially beneficial drugs and therapeutics that are used to treat the same condition in the general population.backgrounddown syndrome is the most common genetic cause of intellectual disability, the most common autosomal trisomy, and one of the most visible and universally recognized genetic syndromes. each year there are approximately 5300 babies born in the united states with down syndrome. within the past 25 years, the average lifespan for a person with down syndrome has doubled, from 30 to 60 years. despite this increase in lifespan, individuals with down syndrome and their families face significant and changing health challenges with age, and they have often been excluded from participation in research that could improve their health outcomes and quality of life. while all people with down syndrome are connected by the common feature of a complete or partial copy of chromosome 21 (trisomy 21), there are significant physical and cognitive differences among them, indicating that inter-individual variability exists.down syndrome is associated with an increased prevalence of autism and epilepsy. about 75% of individuals experience cognitive decline in a syndrome that resembles alzheimer’s disease but has its onset a decade or two earlier than typical alzheimer’s disease. individuals with down syndrome also have high rates of hearing loss, eye abnormalities, congenital heart defects, sleep apnea, pulmonary hypertension, gastrointestinal malformations, thyroid disease, leukemia, and other autoimmune or immune dysregulation disorders including celiac disease. however, people with down syndrome infrequently develop solid tumors such as breast or prostate cancer, and despite multiple risk factors for coronary artery disease and high rates of obesity, sleep apnea, and type 1 diabetes, they rarely develop atherosclerosis or have myocardial infarctions. understanding this unique combination of risk and resiliencies will inform medical advances for individuals with down syndrome, and for individuals who do not have down syndrome but share these co-occurring conditions.this foa is one of several trans-nih research initiatives created in response to fiscal year 2018, 2019, 2020, and 2021 omnibus appropriations reports, which encourage nih to expand its current efforts on down syndrome and common co-occurring conditions also seen in the general population, while increasing the pipeline of down syndrome investigators. together, the initiatives are called the include project (investigation of co-occurring conditions across the lifespan to understand down syndrome). information about projects that were funded in prior years, as well as the nih include down syndrome research plan, are available on the include project website at https://www.nih.gov/include-project/. the include project has three components:scopethis foa addresses component 3 of the include project. specifically, to optimize clinical trial readiness, there needs to be a sufficient understanding of down syndrome and the specific co-occurring conditions to permit the design, conduct, and interpretation of rigorous clinical trials. the purpose of this foa is to seek applications that are intended to facilitate down syndrome research by enabling efficient and effective movement of candidate therapeutics or diagnostics towards clinical trials for down syndrome and its co-occurring conditions, and to increase their likelihood of success through the development and testing of biomarkers and clinical outcome assessment measures, development and testing of novel trial methods and recruitment strategies, or by defining the presentation and course of the co-occurring conditions in individuals with down syndrome to enable the design of future clinical trials.applicants are expected to have clinical expertise in down syndrome and the particular co-occurring condition under study, including the capability for measuring clinical outcomes and analyzing appropriate biomarkers where applicable. this foa seeks applications that demonstrate access to a sufficient number of individuals with down syndrome for inclusion in the proposed study or access to additional participants through collaboration.projects appropriate for this initiative need not be high-risk/high reward studies; however, they should advance the field by facilitating clinical trial readiness through the development of missing components that are essential for rigorous clinical trials.for the purpose of this initiative, clinical trial readiness can include projects that utilize sensitive, reliable, valid, and responsive tools to identify or select appropriate participants for clinical trials, or to measure the effects of interventions. these tools include clinical outcome measures and biomarkers. investigators are encouraged to use or modify existing resources, validate existing tools or add components to existing disease-specific tools (such as symptom scales). projects that define the presentation and course of the co-occurring condition in ways that are essential for the design of upcoming clinical trials can also be included.examples of studies intended to be supported through this foa include, but are not limited to, the following:examples of studies that are considered not appropriate for this foa include, but are not limited to, the following:applications are assigned to participating institutes and centers (ics) based on receipt and referral guidelines, and applications may be assigned to multiple participating ics with related research interests. applicants are encouraged to identify a participating ic that supports their area of research and contact scientific/research staff from relevant ics to inquire about their interest in supporting the proposed research project via the include website, which lists ic-specific funding priorities, as well as contacts for each participating ic.projects that propose to recruit subjects with down syndrome are encouraged to promote enrollment of research subjects in the down syndrome patient registry supported by nih, ds-connect®. for biospecimens collected from human genetic or non-genetic studies, awardees are encouraged to use biorepositories designated by include staff that meet requirements for broad sharing. an nih resource describing common data elements may be helpful during the planning phases of a project when considering ways to optimize data collection in order to facilitate broad data sharing. for those applications that generate clinical data, it is expected that the data sharing plan will include the include data coordinating center (dcc).leveraging existing research resourcesapplicants are encouraged to leverage existing research resources for their clinical trial readiness studies (e.g., existing nih clinical research consortia and networks). contact the ic point of contact in the relevant research area to discuss potential resources.see section viii. other information for award

exploratory/developmental grant supports investigation of novel scientific ideas or new model systems, tools, or technologies that have the potential for significant impact on biomedical or biobehavioral research. an r21 grant application need not have extensive background material or preliminary information. accordingly, reviewers will emphasize the conceptual framework, the level of innovation, and the potential to significantly advance our knowledge or understanding. appropriate justification for the proposed work can be provided through literature citations, data from other sources, or, when available, from investigator-generated data. preliminary data are not required for r21 applications; however, they may be included if available.overall impactreviewers will provide an overall impact score to reflect their assessment of the likelihood for the project to exert a sustained, powerful influence on the research field(s) involved, in consideration of the following review criteria and additional review criteria (as applicable for the project proposed).reviewers will consider each of the review criteria below in the determination of scientific merit, and give a separate score for each. an application does not need to be strong in all categories to be judged likely to have major scientific impact. for example, a project that by its nature is not innovative may be essential to advance a field.does the project address an important problem or a critical barrier to progress in the field? is the prior research that serves as the key support for the proposed project rigorous? if the aims of the project are achieved, how will scientific knowledge, technical capability, and/or clinical practice be improved? how will successful completion of the aims change the concepts, methods, technologies, treatments, services, or preventative interventions that drive this field?are the pd(s)/pi(s), collaborators, and other researchers well suited to the project? if early stage investigators or those in the early stages of independent careers, do they have appropriate experience and training? if established, have they demonstrated an ongoing record of accomplishments that have advanced their field(s)? if the project is collaborative or multi-pd/pi, do the investigators have complementary and integrated expertise; are their leadership approach, governance and organizational structure appropriate for the project?does the application challenge and seek to shift current research or clinical practice paradigms by utilizing novel theoretical concepts, approaches or methodologies, instrumentation, or interventions? are the concepts, approaches or methodologies, instrumentation, or interventions novel to one field of research or novel in a broad sense? is a refinement, improvement, or new application of theoretical concepts, approaches or methodologies, instrumentation, or interventions proposed?are the overall strategy, methodology, and analyses well-reasoned and appropriate to accomplish the specific aims of the project? have the investigators included plans to address weaknesses in the rigor of prior research that serves as the key support for the proposed project? have the investigators presented strategies to ensure a robust and unbiased approach, as appropriate for the work proposed? are potential problems, alternative strategies, and benchmarks for success presented? if the project is in the early stages of development, will the strategy establish feasibility and will particularly risky aspects be managed? have the investigators presented adequate plans to address relevant biological variables, such as sex, for studies in vertebrate animals or human subjects?if the project involves human subjects and/or nih-defined clinical research, are the plans to address 1) the protection of human subjects from research risks, and 2) inclusion (or exclusion) of individuals on the basis of sex/gender, race, and ethnicity, as well as the inclusion or exclusion of individuals of all ages (including children and older adults), justified in terms of the scientific goals and research strategy proposed?will the scientific environment in which the work will be done contribute to the probability of success? are the institutional support, equipment and other physical resources available to the investigators adequate for the project proposed? will the project benefit from unique features of the scientific environment, subject populations, or collaborative arrangements?individuals are required to comply with the instructions for the resource sharing plans as provided in the sf424 (r&r) application guide.the following modifications also apply:all applications, regardless of the amount of direct costs

https://www.hhs.gov/civil-rights/for-individuals/nondiscrimination/index.htmlhhs recognizes that research projects are often limited in scope for many reasons that are nondiscriminatory, such as the principal investigator’s scientific interest, funding limitations, recruitment requirements, and other considerations. thus, criteria in research protocols that target or exclude certain populations are warranted where nondiscriminatory justifications establish that such criteria are appropriate with respect to the health or safety of the subjects, the scientific study design, or the purpose of the research. for additional guidance regarding how the provisions apply to nih grant programs, please contact the scientific/research contact that is identified in section vii under agency contacts
