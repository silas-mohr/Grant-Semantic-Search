eligibility.the purpose of this funding opportunity announcement (foa) is to accelerate innovative drug and device therapies translation from discovery to early human studies. studies appropriate for this foa will develop pharmacologic and neuromodulatory tools for basic and clinical research on mental health disorders or alcohol use disorder (aud); develop and validate tools (pharmacologic or neurostimulation) in support of experimental therapeutic studies of innovative candidates for mental disorders or aud; and support early-stage human studies to rapidly assess the safety, tolerability, and pharmacodynamics of promising drug candidates/devices and new indications for novel investigational new drug (ind)-ready agents or investigational device exemption (ide)-ready devices for the treatment of mental disorders or aud. this foa encourages applications to advance the discovery, preclinical development, and proof of concept (poc) testing of new, rationally based candidate agents and neurostimulation approaches to treat mental disorders or aud, and to develop novel ligands and circuit-engagement devices as tools to further characterize existing or to validate new drug/device targets. partnerships between academia and industry are strongly encouraged. projects seeking support for a research program of multiple projects directed toward a specific major objective, basic theme or program goal, requiring a broadly based, multidisciplinary and often long-term approach should consider the companion foa (par-22-144)this foa will also support applications proposing preclinical discovery of biotechnology products and biologics with potential as candidate therapeutics including, but not limited to, large biologic macromolecules, (e.g., proteins, antibodies, and peptides), gene-based therapies (i.e., oligonucleotide- and viral vector-based), cell therapies, and novel emerging therapies (e.g., microbial and microbiome therapies).this foa supports a discrete, specified, circumscribed project to be performed by the named investigator(s) in an area representing his or her specific interest and competencies.30 days before the application due dateall applications are due by 5:00 pm local time of applicant organization.applicants are encouraged to apply early to allow adequate time to make any corrections to errors found in the application during the submission process by the due date.not applicableit is critical that applicants follow the instructions in the research (r) instructions in the sf424 (r&r) application guide, except where instructed to do otherwise (in this foa or in a notice from nih guide for grants and contracts).conformance to all requirements (both in the application guide and the foa) is required and strictly enforced. applicants must read and follow all application instructions in the application guide as well as any program-specific instructions noted in section iv. when the program-specific instructions deviate from those in the application guide, follow the program-specific instructions.applications that do not comply with these instructions may be delayed or not accepted for review.there are several options available to submit your application through grants.gov to nih and department of health and human services partners. you must use one of these submission options to access the application forms for this opportunity.purposethe intent of this foa is to encourage applications from academic, biotechnology, biomedical device industry, or pharmaceutical industry investigators interested in participating with the national institute of mental health (nimh) or the national institute on alcohol abuse and alcoholism (niaaa) in a national cooperative drug/device discovery/development group (ncddg) program. the objectives of this program are: to advance the discovery, preclinical development, early-stage human studies, and/or proof of concept testing of new, rationally based candidate agents or devices to treat mental disorders, or alcohol use disorder (aud); and to develop novel ligands and novel brain circuit-modulatory technologies as tools to advance biological research on the function of genes, cells, biochemical pathways, distributed neural circuits, and neural oscillatory patterns implicated in the etiology and pathophysiology of mental disorders or aud, and as potential new therapeutics. partnerships between academia and industry are strongly encouraged. this program strongly encourages in-kind resource contributions of the partners within the ncddg (e.g., biotechnology, pharmaceutical, or disease foundations).each ncddg program should consist of a multi-disciplinary team of scientists with appropriate expertise to further the development and evaluation of novel candidate agents or proposed biomedical devices. scientists from both academia and pharmaceutical industry are encouraged to participate within an ncddg; scientists from foreign institutions and nih intramural laboratories may participate in some aspects. it is anticipated that the interaction of academic and non-profit research institutions with industry and nih via the ncddg model will: 1) accelerate the discovery and development of new therapeutics for mental disorders or aud; 2) increase the availability of pharmacologic and device-based research tools (including positron emission tomography (pet) and single photon emission computed tomography (spect) imaging agents) for basic and clinical research; 3) facilitate the development and validation of neurophysiological, pharmacokinetic (pk), and pharmacodynamic (pd) measures to evaluate novel therapeutics for mental disorders or aud; 4) increase the availability of new compounds, agents, and devices suitable for testing in humans; 5) facilitate the development and validation of new clinical measures or biomarkers suitable for use in human proof of concept (poc) trials of novel therapeutics for mental disorders or aud; and/or 6) develop and validate novel neurostimulation technologies and protocols for mental disorders.the goal of the ncddg program is not to duplicate or compete with the private sector but to complement and accelerate the development of research tools for new molecular and circuit targets implicated in mental disorders or aud, and effective compounds, agents, and devices for the prevention and treatment of psychiatric and addictive disorders, as well as core features of these illnesses, especially in areas of unmet medical need.background and research objectivessignificant advances in neuroscience, genetics, genomics, and related omics, behavioral neuroscience, together with technological developments (structural biology, in silico and high throughput screening, in vivo imaging methods), have provided a rich knowledge base for understanding pathophysiology, identifying new molecular targets for drug discovery, new circuit/oscillatory targets for device development, and developing rational pharmacotherapies and neuromodulation interventions for the treatment of psychiatric disorders or aud. with the wealth of potential new drug/device targets, the opportunity exists to accelerate the process of target validation and medication discovery to make great strides toward novel and effective treatments for mental disorders or aud.a u01 application can include no more than a single research project. applications proposing two or more research projects along with scientific and/or administrative core components should respond to the companion foa utilizing the u19 mechanism (see par-22-144)points to consider relevant to this announcement:nimh's objectives and interests for the ncddg programnimh’s objective for the ncddg program is to support innovative, high impact research focused on the discovery of pharmacological agents selective for novel molecular targets and new neuromodulation devices targeting novel neural circuit and neural oscillatory targets with potential to prevent or reverse pathophysiological processes underlying mood and anxiety disorders, schizophrenia, eating disorders, obsessive-compulsive disorder, fragile x, autism, and other mental illnesses. public-private partnerships are particularly encouraged.nimh-relevant ncddg research projects should focus on novel interventions, using either pharmacological agents or neuromodulation devices that interrogate a molecular, circuit or clinical target that is linked to a biological mechanism or pathophysiology of the proposed mental disorder.the nimh strongly encourages an experimental medicine approach to therapeutic development. this foa will support up through first-in-human (fih) for devices or phase ia or ib trials for pharmacological agents. for these trials, studies are expected to assess the agent/device for 1) safety and tolerability, 2) target engagement, and 3) pharmacodynamic effects on relevant circuits or systems. data resulting from phase i trials in healthy controls and in the target patient population are expected to determine optimal clinical dosing and to establish feasibility for further testing in poc and efficacy trials. agents/devices should be sufficiently potent and selective for critical evaluation of target engagement and brain exposure. the agent/indication (if successful) should have a major, not merely incremental, impact on unmet medical need in psychiatric disorders. in support of this effort, nimh recognizes the need for the timely development of new pet tracers for targets that are of interest for assessing target engagement/dose selection for clinical trials of novel therapeutics and for studies of the pathophysiology of psychiatric disorders.consistent with nimh’s research domain criteria (rdoc) initiative, research projects directed towards ameliorating pathophysiology that is potentially more proximal to specific functional deficits (domains) than diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders (dsm) diagnostic entities are encouraged. additional information about the rdoc approach can be found on the rdoc website. the testing of functional domains not included specifically in rdoc may also be considered, if well justified.nimh encourages applications ranging from ligand discovery and testing in preclinical assays through human phase i studies of novel agents. examples include, but are not limited to:nimh also encourages applications ranging from early-stage, pre-clinical, device development to fih clinical trials. examples include, but are not limited to:niaaa's objectives and interests for the ncddg programniaaa's interests pertaining to the ncddg program are in the discovery of novel ligands and development of medications for the treatment of aud as well as novel ligands to be used as tools to research biological processes contributing to excessive drinking as well as to other important aud clinical features (e.g., hyperkatifeia, sensory and emotional pain, stress responsivity, and impaired sleep function). the focus of proposed research projects should follow that described above by nimh but should be relevant to the mission of niaaa. applicants are strongly encouraged to discuss applications involving toxicity, safety and pharmacokinetics as well as poc studies of novel compounds with niaaa staff listed in section vii. agency contact(s). scientific/research contacts.pharmaceutical strategies currently of interest to niaaa for treating aud include agents that: a) reduce craving or the urge to drink, b) reduce the signs and symptoms of protracted alcohol withdrawal including sleep disturbances and negative affect, and c) reduce emotional and physical pain and distress which contributes to elevated alcohol consumption. alcohol's multiple biological effects and the spectrum of physical and behavioral alterations that occur following chronic excessive alcohol drinking offer opportunities for developing additional pharmacotherapies.ncddg is an opportunity to identify and develop therapeutics with the potential to treat aud, or to facilitate and enhance basic and clinical research on identifying the neurobiological and behavioral processes that contribute to the transition from voluntary to compulsive drinking. alcohol-seeking and excessive alcohol drinking are modulated through the actions of neurotransmitter receptors and transporters, ion channels, neuromodulators, hormones, and intracellular signaling networks. thus, there are many potential target sites for which new pharmaceutical agents may be developed, such as effectors of neurotransmitter systems, neuroimmune pathways, and signal transduction pathways.cell and tissue platforms may be developed and validated as initial screening tools to evaluate candidate compounds. we further expect that therapeutics of high interest will be tested and evaluated in validated animal models of aud clinical features. because no single therapeutics is expected to address all behavioral aspects and consequences of aud, projects that propose integrating multiple testing paradigms are sought.identifying and developing agents towards novel targets previously unrecognized or understudied for the treatment of alcohol use disorder is especially encouraged. functional alcohol antagonists, targets aimed at blocking the rewarding effects of alcohol, therapies eliciting noxious states in response to drinking, and narrow variants of clinically validated aud medications (e.g., naltrexone, ondansetron) are deemed low priority by niaaa. applications that essentially propose to further extend the testing of established or well-studied compounds and strategies are not appropriate for this foa.summaryin summary, the ncddg program will support broad, innovative, multidisciplinary approaches to the discovery of new, rationally based treatments and research tools for mental disorders, or aud. since the creative talents in the required scientific disciplines are rarely available in a single institution, a multi-institutional, group approach involving academic, nonprofit, commercial, and/or industrial institutions is envisioned. academic, pharmaceutical and biomedical technology scientists are strongly encouraged to form partnerships that take full advantage of their combined intellectual and material resources for drug discovery, lead optimization, model development, and clinical testing. further, the interaction of academic and non-profit research institutions with pharmaceutical and biomedical device industry and nih is expected to facilitate subsequent development and marketing of new pharmacologic and device treatments, although these latter activities are not within the scope of this foa. molecular targets for drug/device discovery, and the sources and types of chemical/circuit entities to be investigated will be selected by the applying group. both novel mechanisms of action and disease-oriented approaches are of interest.research scopethe objective of this foa is to establish ncddg groups to conduct innovative, high impact research focused on the discovery and testing of chemical entities for novel molecular targets, as well as novel devices for novel circuit/neural dynamic targets implicated in the pathophysiology of mental disorders, or aud. the ncddg serves as a vehicle for pharmaceutical, biomedical devices and academic scientists to pool intellectual and material resources for the translation of basic science findings into the conceptualization, discovery, and evaluation of new chemical entities and devices. groups are encouraged to select molecular targets for drug discovery and circuit targets for device discovery based on recent findings in basic and clinical neuroscience, genetics, and proteomics relevant to the understanding of mental disorders, or aud.the identification of lead compounds/candidate agents/devices and refining them for target validation and medication development are important goals of this initiative.it is anticipated that the interaction of academic and non-profit research institutions with nih and pharmaceutical industry will facilitate timely evaluation and development of preclinical and clinical research tools, models, and novel therapeutics.applicants seeking additional sources of support for preclinical development activities such as toxicology and safety pharmacology assessment, bulk synthesis, gmp synthesis, and formulation development should consider

funded under this foa are expected to share those data via the national institute of mental health data archive (nda; see not-mh-19-033). established by the nih, nda is a secure informatics platform for scientific collaboration and data-sharing that enables the effective communication of detailed research data, tools, and supporting documentation. nda links data across research projects through its global unique identifier (guid) and data dictionary technology. investigators funded under this foa are expected to use these technologies to submit data to nda.to accomplish this objective, it will be important to formulate a) an enrollment strategy that will obtain the information necessary to generate a guid for each participant, and b) a budget strategy that will cover the costs of data submission. the nda web site provides two tools to help investigators develop appropriate strategies: 1) the nda data submission cost model which offers a customizable excel worksheet that includes tasks and hours for the program director/principal investigator and data manager to budget for data sharing; and 2) plain language text to be considered in your informed consent available from the nda's data contribution page. investigators are expected to certify the quality of all data generated by grants funded under this foa prior to submission to nda and review their data for accuracy after submission. submission of descriptive/raw data is expected semi-annually (every january 15 and july 15); submission of all other data is expected at the time of publication, or prior to the end of the grant, whichever occurs first (see nda sharing regimen for more information); investigators are expected to share results, positive and negative, specific to the cohorts and outcome measures studied. the nda data sharing plan is available for review on the nda website. nda staff will work with investigators to help them submit data types not yet defined in the nda data dictionary.when

scientist as described in the terms and conditions of award.use of common data elements in nih-funded researchmany nih ics encourage the use of common data elements (cdes) in basic, clinical, and applied research, patient registries, and other human subject research to facilitate broader and more effective use of data and advance research across studies. cdes are data elements that have been identified and defined for use in multiple data sets across different studies. use of cdes can facilitate data sharing and standardization to improve data quality and enable data integration from multiple studies and sources, including electronic health records. nih ics have identified cdes for many clinical domains (e.g., neurological disease), types of studies (e.g. genome-wide association studies (gwas)), types of outcomes (e.g., patient-reported outcomes), and patient registries (e.g., the global rare diseases patient registry and data repository). nih has established a “common data element (cde) resource portal" (http://cde.nih.gov/) to assist investigators in identifying nih-supported cdes when developing protocols, case report forms, and other instruments for data collection. the portal provides guidance about and access to nih-supported cde initiatives and other tools and resources for the appropriate use of cdes and data standards in nih-funded research. investigators are encouraged to consult the portal and describe in their applications any use they will make of nih-supported cdes in their projects.nimh has released expectations for collecting common data

described in the nih grants policy statement.a formal notification in the form of a notice of award (noa) will be provided to the applicant organization for successful applications. the noa signed by the grants management officer is the authorizing document and will be sent via email to the recipient's business official.recipients must comply with any funding restrictions described in section iv.5. funding restrictions. selection of an application for award is not an authorization to begin performance. any costs incurred before receipt of the noa are at the recipient's risk. these costs may be reimbursed only to the extent considered allowable pre-award costs.any application awarded in response to this foa will be subject to terms and conditions found on the award conditions and information for nih grants website. this includes any recent legislation and policy applicable to awards that is highlighted on this website.the nimh has published policies and guidance for investigators regarding human research protection, data and safety monitoring, independent safety monitors and data and safety monitoring boards, reportable events, and participant recruitment monitoring (not-mh-19-027). the application’s phs human subjects and clinical trials information should reflect the manner in which these policies will be implemented for each study record. these plans will be reviewed by the nimh for consistency with nimh and nih policies and federal regulations. the nimh will expect clinical trials to be conducted in accordance with these policies including, but not limited to: timely registration to clinicaltrials.gov, submission of review determinations from the clinical trial’s data and safety monitoring entity (at least annually), timely submission of reportable events as prescribed, and establishment of recruitment milestones and progress reporting.individual awards are based on the application submitted to, and as approved by, the nih and are subject to the ic-specific terms and conditions identified in the noa.clinicaltrials.gov: if an award provides for one or more clinical trials. by law (title viii, section 801 of public law 110-85), the "responsible party" must register and submit results information for certain “applicable clinical trials” on the clinicaltrials.gov protocol registration and results system information website (https://register.clinicaltrials.gov). nih expects registration and results reporting of all trials whether required under the law or not. for more information, see https://grants.nih.gov/policy/clinical-trials/reporting/index.htminstitutional review board or independent ethics committee approval: recipient institutions must ensure that all protocols are reviewed by their irb or iec. to help ensure the safety of participants enrolled in nih-funded studies, the recipient must provide nih copies of documents related to all major changes in the status of ongoing protocols.data and safety monitoring requirements: the nih policy for data and safety monitoring requires oversight and monitoring of all nih-conducted or -supported human biomedical and behavioral intervention studies (clinical trials) to ensure the safety of participants and the validity and integrity of the data. further information concerning these requirements is found at http://grants.nih.gov/grants/policy/hs/data_safety.htm and in the application instructions (sf424 (r&r) and phs 398).investigational new drug or investigational device exemption requirements: consistent with federal regulations, clinical research projects involving the use of investigational therapeutics, vaccines, or other medical interventions (including licensed products and devices for a purpose other than that for which they were licensed) in humans under a research protocol must be performed under a food and drug administration (fda) investigational new drug (ind) or investigational device exemption (ide).2. administrative and national policy requirementsall nih grant and cooperative agreement awards include the nih grants policy statement as part of the noa. for these terms of award, see the nih grants policy statement part ii: terms and conditions of nih grant awards, subpart a: general and part ii: terms and conditions of nih grant awards, subpart b: terms and conditions for specific types of grants, recipients, and activities, including of note, but not limited to:if a recipient is successful and receives a notice of award, in accepting the award, the recipient agrees that any activities under the award are subject to all provisions currently in effect or implemented during the period of the award, other department regulations and policies in

administer their programs in compliance with federal civil rights laws that prohibit discrimination on the basis of race, color, national origin, disability, age and, in some circumstances, religion, conscience, and sex (including gender identify, sexual orientation, and pregnancy). this includes ensuring programs are accessible to persons with limited english proficiency and persons with disabilities. the hhs office for civil rights provides guidance on complying with civil rights laws enforced by hhs. please see https://www.hhs.gov/civil-rights/for-providers/provider-obligations/index.html and https://www.hhs.gov/civil-rights/for-individuals/nondiscrimination/index.htmlhhs recognizes that research projects are often limited in scope for many reasons that are nondiscriminatory, such as the principal investigator’s scientific interest, funding limitations, recruitment requirements, and other considerations. thus, criteria in research protocols that target or exclude certain populations are warranted where nondiscriminatory justifications establish that such criteria are appropriate with respect to the health or safety of the subjects, the scientific study design, or the purpose of the research. for additional guidance regarding how the provisions apply to nih grant programs, please contact the scientific/research contact that is identified in section vii under agency contacts of this foa.please contact the hhs office for civil rights for more information about obligations and

contained in section 872 of the duncan hunter national defense authorization act of fiscal year 2009 (public law 110-417), nih awards will be subject to the federal awardee performance and integrity information system (fapiis) requirements. fapiis requires federal award making officials to review and consider information about an applicant in the designated integrity and performance system (currently fapiis) prior to making an award. an applicant, at its option, may review information in the designated integrity and performance systems accessible through fapiis and comment on any information about itself that a federal agency previously entered and is currently in fapiis. the federal awarding agency will consider any comments by the applicant, in addition to other information in fapiis, in making a judgement about the applicant’s integrity, business ethics, and record of performance under federal awards when completing the review of risk posed by applicants as described in 45 cfr part 75.205 and 2 cfr part 200.206 “federal awarding agency review of risk posed by applicants.” this provision will apply to all nih grants and cooperative agreements except fellowships.the following special terms of award are in addition to, and not in lieu of, otherwise applicable u.s. office of management and budget (omb) administrative guidelines, u.s. department of health and human services (dhhs) grant administration regulations at 45 cfr part 75, and other hhs, phs, and nih grant administration policies. the administrative and funding instrument used for this program will be the cooperative agreement, an "assistance" mechanism (rather than an "acquisition" mechanism), in which substantial nih programmatic involvement with the recipients is anticipated during the performance of the activities. under the cooperative agreement, the nih purpose is to support and stimulate the recipients' activities by involvement in and otherwise working jointly with the award recipients in a partnership role; it is not to assume direction, prime responsibility, or a dominant role in the activities. consistent with this concept, the dominant role and prime responsibility resides with the recipients for the project as a whole, although specific tasks and activities may be shared among the recipients and the nih as defined below.the pd(s)/pi(s) will have the primary responsibility for:nih staff members will have substantial programmatic involvement that is above and beyond the normal stewardship role in awards, as described below:the project scientist(s) interacts scientifically with the group and may provide appropriate assistance, including assisting in research planning, suggesting studies within the scope of the group's objectives and research activities, presenting experimental findings to the group from published sources or from relevant contract projects, participating in the analysis of results, and advising in management and technical performance. the project scientist(s) will be a member(s) of the steering committee (defined below). however, the total membership by nih staff will not exceed one-third (1/3) of the membership of the steering committee. in all cases, the role of nimh or niaaa will be to assist and facilitate and not to direct activities.the nimh or niaaa project scientist(s) can recommend to their institutes to utilize their drug development resources (e.g., cns receptor screening, chemical synthesis, and toxicology services) in support of the ncddg group research activities if such resources are required on an occasional basis. the following is a list of resources that are readily available and may be supplied if they become desirable during performance. it is not anticipated that requests of services will be considered as a continuing need.fih and phase i studies may be reviewed by the appropriate nih institute's data and safety monitoring board (dsmb) to ensure the safety of participants and the validity and integrity of the data. the study protocol(s) and consent form(s) will be reviewed by the dsmb prior to initiation of the project. the dsmb will review study reports from the ncddg group on a regular basis to monitor subject enrollment and retention, safety, quality of data collection, and integrity of the study. based on its review, the dsmb has the authority to stop the study after it has started.additionally, an nimh or niaaa program official will be responsible for the normal scientific and programmatic stewardship of the award, including monitoring implementation of the data and research resource sharing plans and will be named in the award notice.participation of nih intramural scientists. an nih intramural scientist may not serve as the pd/pi of an ncddg but may participate in a group as collaborator, or consultant. however, an intramural scientist may not receive salary, equipment, supplies, or other remuneration from awards resulting from this foa. the intramural scientist must obtain written approval of his/her nih institute scientific director for the amount of resources that may be allocated to the project. the approval must also specify that the conduct of the project will comply with the dhhs regulations for research involving human subjects (if applicable) and with the phs policy on vertebrate animal research. the participation of an intramural scientist is independent of and unrelated to the role of the nimh and/or niaaa project scientist. for ncddg applications that include nih intramural components, the intramural resource level will be included in the total cost of the overall application. the involvement of intramural scientists needs to be consistent with nih policy, http://www1.od.nih.gov/oir/sourcebook/ethic-conduct/ethical-conduct-toc.htm.areas of joint responsibility include:steering committee: a governing steering committee composed of the pd/pi(s), key research scientists, collaborators or consultants, outside experts), the nih project scientist(s), and the nih program official (as a non-voting member) will be established in each ncddg to assist in monitoring and developing the scientific content and direction of the program. when included in the steering committee, outside experts are chosen by the pd/pi(s) in consultation with the nih project scientist and program official. each named member of the steering committee will have one vote, except the nih program official.the steering committee members will meet periodically to review and monitor progress, plan and design research activities, and establish priorities. the frequency of meetings, not fewer than two per year, will be determined by the pd/pi, who will be responsible for scheduling the time and place (in person or by video or audio teleconference) and for preparing concise proceedings or minutes (two or three pages) which will be delivered to the members of the group within 2 weeks of the meeting.a. the principal end products of ncddg activities for nimh and niaaa are expected to include: 1) the discovery and testing of new chemical entities, optimization of lead compounds, ind-directed toxicology, safety pharmacology to support phase i studies and identification of clinical candidates for subsequent poc studies for the treatment of mental disorders or alcohol addiction; 2) research tools; and 3) models and pharmacodynamic measures to evaluate novel therapeutics. cost-sharing is encouraged for ind-directed toxicity and safety studies of drug candidates, gmp synthesis, formulation, and ind filing costs.b. nimh and/or niaaa will retain the option to cross-file or independently file an application for an investigational clinical trial (e.g., an ind application to the united states food and drug administration) of any clinical research tool or invention resulting from these nih supported cooperative agreements. reports of data generated by the group or any of its members required for inclusion in ind applications and for cross-filing purposes shall be submitted promptly by the principal investigator to the nih institute project scientist upon request. such reports shall include background information, methods, results, and conclusions.dispute resolution:any disagreements that may arise in scientific or programmatic matters (within the scope of the award) between award recipients and the nih may be brought to dispute resolution. a dispute resolution panel composed of three members will be convened. it will have three members: a designee of the steering committee chosen without nih staff voting, one nih designee, and a third designee with expertise in the relevant area who is chosen by the other two; in the case of individual disagreement, the first member may be chosen by the individual recipient. this special dispute resolution procedure does not alter the recipient's right to appeal an adverse action that is otherwise appealable in accordance with phs regulation 42 cfr part 50, subpart d and dhhs regulation 45 cfr part 16.intellectual property and patent rights for new chemical entities:since the discovery of new pharmacological treatments for mental disorders or alcohol addiction is a major objective of this effort and active involvement by pharmaceutical laboratories is encouraged and may be facilitated by the existence of appropriate patent coverage, it is essential that applicants provide plans to address the handling of intellectual property for new chemical entities for the treatment of mental disorders, or alcohol addiction under this foa.successful applicants are required to supply the following confidential materials to the nimh and/or niaaa program officials listed under section vii. agency contacts.1. each applicant group must provide a detailed description of the approach to be used for handling intellectual property and for licensing where appropriate, in particular where the invention may involve investigators from more than one institution. procedures must be described for resolution of legal problems should they arise. your attention is drawn to the nih extramural technology transfer policies and documents [http://grants.nih.gov/grants/intell-property.htm].2. a formal statement of intellectual property among all group members and their institutions as well as a detailed description of procedures to be followed for resolution of legal problems which may develop, must be signed and dated by the organizational official authorized to enter into intellectual property arrangements for each group member and member institution. the signed agreement should be submitted prior to award to the appropriate nimh and/or niaaa staff at the addresses provided under section vii. agency contacts.3. a plan must be developed for disposition of combinatorial and compound libraries generated in research projects focused on discovery of new chemical entities as clinical candidates for drug development in conformance with section vi.2.a - cooperative agreement terms and conditions of award and consistent with achieving the goals of the program. the signed
