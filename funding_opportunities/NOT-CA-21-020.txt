optional)national cancer institute (nci)the national cancer institute (nci) is issuing this notice of special interest (nosi) to encourage applications that efficiently use the existing cancer registry infrastructure by augmenting existing data with additional information not routinely collected by registries to study observed health disparities such as those that exist by race, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, income, insurance status, age, education level, or geographic area. the surveillance, epidemiology, and end results (seer) program and the national program of cancer registries (npcr) are uniquely positioned to support research to assess health disparities in the united states (us) population because they contain information on all cases diagnosed within geographically defined areas. the goal of these hypothesis-driven studies should be to understand why disparities in cancer treatment and outcomes persist by identifying factors contributing to disparities and their relative importance.backgroundcancer registries represent a sampling frame of cancer patients that contain considerable information on patient demographics, primary tumor site, tumor morphology and stage at diagnosis, first course of treatment, and follow-up for mortality outcomes. additionally, seer registries collect information on several key predictive and prognostic factors, such as her2 for breast cancer, psa for prostate cancer, and hpv status for some cancers. many registries can identify cases soon after diagnosis (called rapid case ascertainment) for inclusion in studies.the us cancer registry system represents a considerable investment toward establishing the infrastructure needed to collect information on individuals diagnosed with cancer. data from cancer registries are often used to identify observed disparities in treatment and outcomes. these findings lead to hypotheses as to why disparities are occurring.research objectivesnci is interested in hypothesis-driven research that utilizes the national cancer registry infrastructure to study disparities related to the cancer treatment received and outcomes (such as survival, mortality, quality of life, financial hardship) among different population groups who are diagnosed with cancer. although existing data sources provide the foundation for population-based research, understanding factors that contribute to health disparities is a complex and multifaceted problem and often requires information beyond that routinely captured. for the projects supported by this nosi, registry data may be augmented through linkages with other data sources, analysis of biospecimens, or additional data collection such as surveying cancer patients or physicians.studies using these data will provide insight into the factors, and their relative importance, that lead to the disparate treatment and outcomes experienced by different population groups. such studies constitute a necessary first step in designing and implementing effective interventions to eliminate those disparities.examples of the types of analyses supported by this nosi include, but are not limited to:responsivenessapplicants submitting
