grant application due dates between september 22 and september 30, 2022see section iii. 3. additional information on eligibility.the diversity center for genome research (dcgr) program aims to establish genomic research centers at minority serving institutions (msis) as defined in part 2, section iii of the foa. the msis must have a mission to serve historically underrepresented populations in biomedical research that award doctorate degrees in the health professions or the sciences related to health, and have received an average of less than $50 million per year in nih support and less than $25 million per year of r01 total cost of nih support for the past three fiscal years. each dcgr award will support a multi-investigator, interdisciplinary team to develop 2-3 interrelated, innovative genomic research projects. each project should address one or more critical issues in genomics including: genomic technology and methods development; genome structure; genome function; genomics of disease; use and impact of genomic information in clinical care; genomic data science and computational genomics; ethical, legal, and social implications of genomic research; and/or genomics and health equity. along with its scientific goals, the dcgr should expand the pool of diverse genomic scientists, clinician scientists, and researchers who can perform innovative genomics research by providing didactic, practicum and research activities and experiences that are aligned with the research projects.30 days prior to the application due dateall applications are due by 5:00 pm local time of applicant organization.applicants are encouraged to apply early to allow adequate time to make any corrections to errors found in the application during the submission process by the due date.not applicableit is critical that applicants follow the multi-project (m) instructions in the sf424 (r&r) application guide, except where instructed to do otherwise (in this foa or in a notice from the nih guide for grants and contracts). conformance to all requirements (both in the application guide and the foa) is required and strictly enforced. applicants must read and follow all application instructions in the application guide as well as any program-specific instructions noted in section iv. when the program-specific instructions deviate from those in the application guide, follow the program-specific instructions. applications that do not comply with these instructions may be delayed or not accepted for review.there are several options available to submit your application through grants.gov to nih and department of health and human services partners. you must use one of these submission options to access the application forms for this opportunity.backgroundin 2020, the national human genome research institute engaged the scientific community to identify future research priorities and opportunities in human genomics, resulting in our 2020 strategic vision for improving health at the forefront of genomics (https://www.genome.gov/2020sv) this vision outlined the guiding principles and values for human genomics, including championing a diverse workforce which includes individuals from backgrounds that are not well represented in biomedical research (see nih interest in diversity: https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/not-od-20-031.html) , embracing interdisciplinary teams in genomic research, and increasing access to genomic medicine.investigators from different backgrounds bring different perspectives, exchange innovative ideas, and increase the objectivity in generating new data and in its interpretation, which leads to knowledge that is more reliable, but the scientific and biomedical workforce in the united states (u.s.) is not as diverse as the u.s. population, and this extends to the genomics research workforce. this lack of diversity negatively impacts the scope, integrity, and applicability of research. minority serving institutions (msis) with a mission to serve historically underrepresented populations have played an important role in supporting scientific research, particularly on diseases and conditions that disproportionately impact racial/ethnic minorities and other u.s. populations that experience health disparities, though they often lack sufficient capacity to conduct and sustain cutting-edge health-related research. . researchers at these institutions are uniquely positioned to bring novel perspectives and broaden the field of genomics, e.g., by engaging racial and ethnic minority populations in research and helping to translate research advances into culturally competent, measurable and sustained improvements in health outcomes for underserved communities.this initiative will champion a diverse genomics research workforce by supporting cutting-edge genomic research projects, capacity building and training in genomics at msis as defined in section iii.program descriptionoverall plans for the center: the purpose of this program is to support the development of innovative genomic research projects through infrastructure building and the formation of interdisciplinary research teams at minority serving institutions (msis) with a historical mission to serve underrepresented populations (see section iii). through this initiative, genomic research capacity will be increased in msis; the diversity of the genomics research workforce will be enhanced; innovation and creativity will be amplified by bringing new researchers and thus novel ideas into the field of genomics; and participation of underrepresented populations and underserved communities that often experience health disparities will be increased in genomics research.the primary goals of the diversity centers for genome research are to enhance diversity in genomics research by establishing centers to carry out innovative, state-of-the-art genomic research studies; foster genomic research career development and enhancement for trainees and investigators at all career levels; enhance the genomic infrastructure, computational, analytical and elsi research capability within eligible msis; establish sustainable partnerships and disseminate resources and findings.the proposed center is expected to support an administrative core, genomic workforce development core, community engagement core, and two to three interrelated, innovative genomic research projects that address one or more critical issues in the following: genomic technology and methods development; genome structure; genome function; genomics of disease; use and impact of genomic information in clinical care; ethical, legal, and social implications of genomic research; genomics and health equity; and/or computational genomics.program governance: awards made under this foa will be cooperative agreements (seesection vi.2., cooperative agreement terms and conditions of award). a consortium will be organized with the principal investigators, key personnel of the centers funded under this foa and the companion foa (rfa-hg-22-027), and nih staff. full-scale diversity centers for genome research funded under this foa will share experiences and disseminate best practices with developing centers funded under the companion foa (rfa-hg-22-027) to provide them with lessons learned as they strengthen their research capacity and ability to accomplish the activities that will be necessary to execute their proposed full-scale diversity center for genome research.the program director(s)/principal investigator(s) (pd(s)/pi(s)) from each center will be responsible for the scientific direction of the consortium and will meet in person as a steering committee (see section vi.2., cooperative agreement terms and conditions of award) two times per year and by conference call on a monthly basis. the steering committee will develop best practices and explore opportunities for synergy among centers. working groups may be established to facilitate collaborative work and explore new research collaborations. center investigators, collaborators, students, and trainees are encouraged to attend steering committee meetings. it is expected that resources and data will be shared within the consortium, as needed.required components of the diversity center for genome research:the following components are required for each center:descriptions of required componentsadministrative corethe administrative core should be directed by the pd(s)/pi(s) of the center. this core will provide overall management in administrative, fiscal, and scientific aspects of the center including career enhancement activities for students, trainees, and faculty, and foster synergy with other ongoing genomic career development activities at the institution, including any funded through other nih grants. this core will also develop and monitor core and project milestones which including evaluating each proposed activity/core and the impact of the center in terms of: 1) enhancing the institutional research capacity and environment necessary to facilitate genomic research; 2) increasing productivity of investigators in peer-reviewed publications and 3) increasing the institution's overall success in applying for and obtaining extramural research funding. successful applicants will be expected to work closely with nih to develop and implement common metrics of core and project progress and share data on programmatic outcomes for each center component.the centers’ pd(s)/pi(s) are expected to meet as a consortium with other awardees funded under this foa and the ug3/uh3 foa (rfa-hg-22-027) twice per year in person to present research progress, discuss challenges, promote collaboration amongst centers and share best practices for center operations. centers’ pd(s)/pi(s) will also be encouraged to attend other research consortia and network meetings to increase collaborative opportunities.genomic workforce development corethe goal of the genomic workforce development core is to provide genomic research experiences, genomic career development opportunities and genomic education enhancement activities within each research project. nih is committed to fostering diversity, inclusivity, and accessibility in the genomics research community. applicants should strive to compose teams richly diverse in perspectives, backgrounds, and academic disciplines, and provide full opportunity and participation to individuals and groups underrepresented in genomics. this foa requires a plan for enhancing diverse perspectives (pedp) as part of the application (see section iv below). applicants should take advantage of unique aspects of the research cores and projects, the investigators' talents, and other institutional resources to offer innovative, substantive educational, career development and research experience opportunities for k-12 students, undergraduate students, masters level students, pre-doctoral students, post-doctoral fellows, and other investigators to develop and/or enhance expertise in genomics. research enhancement activities include practical research experiences, seminars, courses, workshops, and other career enhancement activities that increase the recruitment, advancement, and retention of investigators from diverse backgrounds, including those from groups underrepresented in genomic research careers. genomic career development opportunities include coordination with other genomic activities at the institution and in the geographic area, and development of the individual in a way that is tailored toward their career goals and needs. the core will also support collaborations with other researchers at the applicant institution as well as other institutions.community engagement corethe community engagement core should facilitate engagement of the community in the development of materials for genomic education and training, research design, analyses, and outcome assessment. this includes but is not limited to the development of the genomic research questions, identification of exposures of concern to that community, suitable cohorts, and specific needs of subpopulations; the translation and dissemination of study results, and development of methods for evaluating the success of the project. the community includes but is not limited to population groups, stakeholders, interest groups, citizen groups, neighborhoods, advocacy groups, etc. the core should also coordinate dissemination activities with community members, partner organizations, and relevant service organizations or policymakers, as well as the scientific community, including presentation of findings from research projects to community stakeholders. core activities are expected to be incorporated within the research projects and strengthen community-engaged research approaches.research project(s)the diversity centers for genome research should be structured around two to three research projects that address one or more critical issues in the following: genomic technology and methods development; genome structure; genome function; genomics of disease; use and impact of genomic information in clinical care; ethical, legal, and social implications of genomics research; genomics and health equity; data science and/or computational genomics. projects may include applications to a particular disease area, but centers should demonstrate that the methods and knowledge generated are broadly generalizable across disease areas. studies focused on disease etiology or outcomes should examine the role of both genomic and non-genomic contributors to human health and disease. all applications, regardless of focus, should explain how generalizable, broadly useful, and transformative the findings and approaches will be to the field of genomics. if the research project has areas of focus in clinical genomics, it should improve assessment and/or outcomes in all populations including underserved populations and/or include technological or computational methods for the production or analysis of diverse data sets. the centers should bring together different areas of expertise and different research approaches to provide synergy and allow each project to accomplish more than it would be able to on its own.the following list provides some examples of different types of topics that could be the focus of a diversity center for genome research. applicants should understand, however, that this list is meant only to provide guidance; it is not exhaustive and appropriate topics are not limited to the examples given.national human genome research institute (nhgri)genetic/environmental, including social determinants of health, contributors to disease. a center application may involve collection of new samples and/or the use of existing samples from one or more populations of interest to study the genetic epidemiology of a diseases or disorders that present a significant public health burden. the individuals from whom samples are collected or re-used should be well-phenotyped to ensure that the disease being studied has been properly diagnosed.function genomics. functional genomics includes an assessment of how the genome functions, how genomic variation affects genome function to influence phenotypes, and how processes in the body are influenced by genomic variation.an assessment of inherited diseases. an analysis of individuals affected by monogenic diseases or complex genetic disorders to identify causative mutations, modifier genes, and environmental risk factors during early development.pharmacogenomics. pharmacogenomics research seeks to identify genetic factors that are responsible for individual differences in drug efficacy and susceptibility to adverse drug reactions as well as the role these individual differences may play in the development of antimicrobial resistance.ethical, legal, and social implications (elsi). elsi research seeks to identify, analyze, and address the elsi of genomic technological and scientific advances for individuals, families, communities, and society.genomic medicine. genomic medicine is an emerging medical discipline that involves using genomic information about an individual as part of their clinical care (e.g. for diagnostic or therapeutic decision-making) and the health outcomes and policy implications of that clinical use.bioinformatics. advances in tools and techniques for data generation are rapidly increasing the amount of data available to researchers, particularly in genomics requires researchers to rely more heavily on computational and data science tools for the storage, management, analysis, and visualization of data. projects could include research and development of transformative approaches and tools that maximize the integration of data (e.g., genomics data, environmental measures, phenotypes, and biomarkers) and data science into biomedical research.genomic technology development. research in genomic technology development seeks to advance methods, technologies, and instruments needed to generate increasingly complex genomic data, including new and improved methods for sequencing nucleic acids, detecting genomic variation, and mapping epigenomic and epitranscriptomic features.genome structure and function. research in genome structure and function utilizes high-throughput genomic methods to understand how the genome is organized, to detect structurally complex genome variation and 3d genome organization, to assess how the genome functions, and to assess how genomic variation affects genome function to influence phenotypes, including those related to human health and disease.nhgri is committed to maximizing the utility of genomics for all populations. racial and ethnic minority populations, less privileged socioeconomic status (ses) populations, underserved rural populations, sexual and gender minorities (sgm), and other populations who experience poorer medical outcomes have been vastly underrepresented in genomic research to date. the underrepresentation is widely recognized to seriously impair investigators' ability to interpret genomic variants and use them in clinical care across the spectrum of race, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, access to care, and health and morbidity. understanding and use of the vastness of human genetic variation for clinical diagnosis, prevention, and treatment require studies of genomic variation and its disease consequences across sociodemographic groups. for this reason, projects are strongly encouraged to include minority health and health disparities populations. where applicable, projects should emphasize the use of samples that are derived from individuals of diverse ancestry, that allow for consideration of sex as a biological variable, and that allow for the consideration of applications to diseases disproportionately affecting minority health and health disparities populations.additional information about the research priorities of nhgri is available at the following link: https://www.genome.gov/research-funding/funding-opportunities.national institute of mental health (nimh)nimh is interested in research programs examining the contribution of genetic and genomic factors to risk and resilience in psychiatric disorders in ancestrally diverse minority health and health disparity populations as described in our strategic objectives:specific interests include but not limited to the following:national institute on minority health and health disparities (nimhd)the mission of nimhd is to lead scientific research to improve minority health and reduce health disparities in populations that experience health disparities (i.e., african americans/blacks, hispanic/latinos, american indians/alaska natives, asians, native hawaiians, and other pacific islanders, socioeconomically disadvantaged populations, underserved rural populations, and sexual and gender minority populations).nimhd encourages projects that use approaches encompassing multiple domains of influence (e.g., biological, behavioral, sociocultural, environmental, physical environment, health system) and multiple levels of influence (e.g., individual, interpersonal, family, peer group, community, societal) to understand and address health disparities (see the nimhd research framework,https://www.nimhd.nih.gov/about/overview/research-framework.html, for more information).specific interest include but not limited to the following:awardees are expected to comply with the nih genomic data sharing policy (https://gds.nih.gov/) as well as the nhgri genomic data sharing policy

bioinformatic tools are expected to be made available through an open access section of a database such as dbgap, anvil, other public web sites, and/or publication in the scientific literature. centers are encouraged to get feedback from the communities in which the research will be performed regarding plans for sharing individual level data resulting from the research projects with the scientific community for research purposes. feedback and recommendations for data access, protection of participant and patient privacy and confidentiality, and management of health information should be integrated into the center’s data sharing plan. note that any project receiving nih funding that collects or uses identifiable, sensitive information is automatically deemed issued a certificate of confidentiality (coc).this foa will provide up to $500,000 in direct costs for genomic technology and equipment in addition to the overall cost cap, only in year one of the award period, as a one-time cost expenditure for the center. if such research resources are requested, the technology and/or equipment should be relevant to the scope of the proposed research and the implementation of the

includes any recent legislation and policy applicable to awards that is highlighted on this website.individual awards are based on the application submitted to, and as approved by, the nih and are subject to the ic-specific terms and conditions identified in the noa.clinicaltrials.gov: if an award provides for one or more clinical trials. by law (title viii, section 801 of public law 110-85), the "responsible party" must register and submit results information for certain “applicable clinical trials” on the clinicaltrials.gov protocol registration and results system information website (https://register.clinicaltrials.gov). nih expects registration and results reporting of all trials whether required under the law or not. for more information, see https://grants.nih.gov/policy/clinical-trials/reporting/index.htminstitutional review board or independent ethics committee approval: grantee institutions must ensure that all protocols are reviewed by their irb or iec. to help ensure the safety of participants enrolled in nih-funded studies, the recipient must provide nih copies of documents related to all major changes in the status of ongoing protocols.data and safety monitoring requirements: the nih policy for data and safety monitoring requires oversight and monitoring of all nih-conducted or -supported human biomedical and behavioral intervention studies (clinical trials) to ensure the safety of participants and the validity and integrity of the data. further information concerning these requirements is found at http://grants.nih.gov/grants/policy/hs/data_safety.htm and in the application instructions (sf424 (r&r) and phs 398).investigational new drug or investigational device exemption requirements:

https://www.hhs.gov/civil-rights/for-individuals/nondiscrimination/index.html.hhs recognizes that research projects are often limited in scope for many reasons that are nondiscriminatory, such as the principal investigator’s scientific interest, funding limitations, recruitment requirements, and other considerations. thus, criteria in research protocols that target or exclude certain populations are warranted where nondiscriminatory justifications establish that such criteria are appropriate with respect to the health or safety of the subjects, the scientific study design, or the purpose of the research. for additional guidance regarding how the provisions apply to nih grant programs, please contact the scientific/research contact that is identified in section vii under agency contacts of this foa.recipients of ffa must ensure that their programs are accessible to persons with limited english proficiency. for guidance on meeting the legal obligation to take reasonable steps to

the statutory provisions contained in section 872 of the duncan hunter national defense authorization act of fiscal year 2009 (public law 110-417), nih awards will be subject to the federal awardee performance and integrity information system (fapiis) requirements. fapiis requires federal award making officials to review and consider information about an applicant in the designated integrity and performance system (currently fapiis) prior to making an award. an applicant, at its option, may review information in the designated integrity and performance systems accessible through fapiis and comment on any information about itself that a federal agency previously entered and is currently in fapiis. the federal awarding agency will consider any comments by the applicant, in addition to other information in fapiis, in making a judgement about the applicant’s integrity, business ethics, and record of performance under federal awards when completing the review of risk posed by applicants as described in 45 cfr part 75.205 and 2 cfr part 200.206 “federal awarding agency review of risk posed by applicants.” this provision will apply to all nih grants and cooperative agreements except fellowships.the following special terms of award are in addition to, and not in lieu of, otherwise applicable u.s. office of management and budget (omb) administrative guidelines, u.s. department of health and human services (dhhs) grant administration regulations at 45 cfr part 75, 2 cfr part 200, and other hhs, phs, and nih grant administration policies.the administrative and funding instrument used for this program will be the cooperative agreement, an "assistance" mechanism (rather than an "acquisition" mechanism), in which substantial nih programmatic involvement with the recipients is anticipated during the performance of the activities. under the cooperative agreement, the nih's purpose is to support and stimulate the recipients' activities by involvement in and otherwise working jointly with the award recipients in a partnership role; it is not to assume direction, prime responsibility, or a dominant role in the activities. consistent with this concept, the dominant role and prime responsibility reside with the recipients for the project as a whole, although specific tasks and activities may be shared among the recipients and the nih as defined below.the pd(s)/pi(s) will have the primary responsibility for:nih staff have substantial programmatic involvement that is above and beyond the normal stewardship role in awards, as described below:the project scientist(s) are scientists of the nhgri who will have substantial scientific and programmatic involvement during the conduct of this activity through technical assistance, advice, and coordination. however, the role of nih staff will be to facilitate and not to direct the activities. it is anticipated that decisions in all activities will be reached by consensus of the program and that nih staff will be given the opportunity to offer input to this process. the project scientist(s) will participate as a member of the steering committee and will have one vote. he/she/they and/or other nhgri scientists may serve on additional committees, when appropriate. the nhgri project scientist (and other nhgri program staff) may work with recipients on issues coming before the steering committee and, as appropriate, other committees. nhgri program staff, on behalf of the nhgri, will have the same access, privileges, and responsibilities regarding the collaborative data as the other members of the steering committee.the project scientist(s) will have the following substantial involvement:additionally, an agency program official or ic program director will be responsible for the normal scientific and programmatic stewardship of the award and will be named in the award notice. the assigned program director may also serve as an nih project scientist.areas of joint responsibility include:dispute resolution:any disagreements that may arise in scientific or programmatic matters (within the scope of the award) between award recipients and nih may be brought to dispute resolution. a dispute resolution panel composed of three members will be convened including a designee of the steering committee chosen without nih staff voting, one nih designee, and a third designee with expertise in the relevant area who is chosen by the other two; in the case of individual disagreement, the first member may be chosen by the individual recipient. this special dispute resolution procedure does not alter the recipient's right to appeal an adverse action that is otherwise appealable in accordance with phs regulation 42 cfr part 50, subpart d and dhhs regulation 45 cfr part 16.data management and sharingnote: the nih policy for data management and sharing is effective for due dates on or after january 25, 2023.consistent with the nih policy for data management and sharing, when data management and sharing is applicable to the award, recipients will be required to adhere to the data management and sharing requirements as outlined in the nih grants policy statement. upon the approval of a data management and sharing plan, it is required for recipients to implement the plan as described.when multiple years are involved, recipients will be required to submit the research performance progress report (rppr) annually and financial statements as required in the nih grants policy statement.a final rppr, invention statement, and the expenditure data portion of the federal financial report are required for closeout of an award, as described in the nih grants policy statement. nih foas outline intended research goals and objectives. post award, nih will review and measure performance based on the details and outcomes that are shared within the rppr, as described at 45 cfr part 75.301 and 2 cfr part 200.301.the federal funding accountability and transparency act of 2006 (transparency act), includes a requirement for recipients of federal grants to report information about first-tier subawards and executive compensation under federal assistance awards issued in fy2011 or later. all recipients of applicable nih grants and cooperative agreements are required to report to the federal subaward reporting system (fsrs) available at www.fsrs.gov on all subawards over the threshold. see the nih grants policy statement for additional information on this reporting requirement.in accordance with the regulatory requirements provided at 45 cfr 75.113and 2 cfr part 200.113 and appendix xii to 45 cfr part 75 and 2 cfr part 200, recipients that have currently active federal grants, cooperative agreements, and procurement contracts from all federal awarding agencies with a cumulative total value greater than $10,000,000 for any period of time during the period of performance of a federal award, must report and maintain the currency of information reported in the system for award management (sam)about civil, criminal, and administrative proceedings in connection with the award or performance of a federal award that reached final disposition within the most recent five-year period. the recipient must also make semiannual disclosures regarding such proceedings. proceedings information will be made publicly available in the designated integrity and performance system (currently fapiis). this is a statutory requirement under section 872 of public law 110-417, as amended (41 u.s.c. 2313). as required by section 3010 of public law 111-212, all information posted in the designated integrity and performance system on or after april 15, 2011, except past performance reviews required for federal procurement contracts, will be publicly available. full reporting requirements and procedures are found in appendix xii to 45 cfr part 75and 2 cfr part 200 – award term and condition for recipient
