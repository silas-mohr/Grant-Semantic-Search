andb) independent, non-clinical trial research studies. these non-clinical trial research studies do not have to be attached to an nih-funded study and can be qualitative/formative studies such as focus groups, interviews, surveys, observational study designs, etc., or basic science studies not involving humans.applicants will need to provide documentation of regulatory approvals/compliance as applicable to the proposed studies (e.g., institutional animal care and use committee approval , institutional review board approval).eligibilityonly currently awarded pride summer institute programs (r25) are eligible for this program. mentees supported by the si's srp supplement must have an active appointment to the pride program and have completed only the first summer institute at the time of application for the administrative supplement. upon award of the srp, mentees are expected to conduct their research during the interim between the first and second summer institute. pending the timing of the srp supplement award, it may be necessary for mentees to continue their research several months after the completion of the second summer institute (even if their formal appointment to the r25 has been terminated) in order to complete their award term.evaluationthe pride coordination center will be expected to include the impact of srps as a part of the overall pride program evaluation.before submitting an application, applicants are strongly encouraged to consult with the program official for the parent grant or the contact listed below to confirm eligibility and to obtain technical assistance.application and submission informationapplications for this nosi must be submitted using the following opportunity or its subsequent reissued equivalent.all instructions in the sf424 (r&r) application guide and pa-20-272 must be followed, with the following additions:the progress report and budget for the supplement must be included with, but clearly delineated from, the progress report and budget for the parent award. the progress report must include information about the activities supported by the supplement even if support for future years is not requested.nhlbi must be informed no later than 30 days of award termination. if the supplement has been in effect at least six months, a final progress report must also be submitted.application review informationadministrative supplements do not receive peer review. instead, the administrative criteria described below will be considered in the administrative evaluation process.in coordination with the pride cc, the nhlbi program staff will evaluate requests for a supplement to determine its overall merit. the following general criteria will be used to evaluate supplement applications:funding for supplement applications is not guaranteed. as with all supplement requests, a financial review to determine the need for additional funds will take place by the office of grants management before a final funding decision is made.please direct all inquiries to:nicole redmond, md, phd, mph national heart, lung, and blood institute (nhlbi) telephone: 301-435-0379 email: nicole.redmond@nih.govweekly toc for this announcement nih funding opportunities and noticesnote: for help accessing pdf, rtf, ms word, excel, powerpoint, audio or video files, see help downloading files.
