services partners. you must use one of these submission options to access the application forms for this opportunity.funding opportunity purposethe purpose of this funding opportunity announcement (foa) is to support the archiving and documentation of existing data sets within the scientific mission of the eunice kennedy shriver national institute of child health and human development (nichd) to facilitate secondary analysis of these data by the scientific community. the highest priority is to facilitate the sharing of original data collected with nichd funding.backgroundnichd leads research and training to understand human development, improve reproductive health, enhance the lives of children and adolescents, and optimize abilities for all. nichd's broad and diverse research portfolio supports research related to conception and pregnancy; typical and atypical development in childhood; childhood trauma, injury, and critical illness; the transition from adolescence to adulthood; reproductive health; rehabilitation; intellectual, developmental, and physical disabilities; and population dynamics across the lifespan.the products of this research include a wide variety of data types and biological samples on a wide array of relevant inputs including imaging, measures related to psychosocial and sociodemographic factors, cognition, genetic data, biomarkers, pregnancy, reproductive health, behavioral medicine, and well-being over the life course. to encourage data sharing, nichd supports the data and specimen hub (dash).data sharing increases the scientific value of research. nih encourages researchers to make their data as widely and freely available as possible while safeguarding the privacy of participants and protecting confidential and proprietary data. the details of nih’s data sharing requirements are available on the scientific data sharing website. research applications submitted to nih for the january 25, 2023 and subsequent receipt dates will be subject to the nih policy for data management and sharing.scopethe scope of this initiative includes archiving activities associated with providing access to data that can be used for secondary research within the scientific mission of the nichd. for the purposes of this announcement, "archiving activities" include activities related to data management and sharing including assembling, cleaning, harmonizing, documenting, creating metadata for, and disseminating data via submission to an appropriate repository. types of data of interest include, but are not limited to: administrative data, survey data, results of assays conducted on biospecimens, data from clinical trials, data from patient registries, and imaging data. data from research studies using humans and/or animal models are appropriate for this foa.proposed activities must protect and maintain confidentiality for research subjects and must include all protections outlined in subject or patient consent forms, if any. algorithms used for any data cleaning, recoding, and harmonizing activities must be made publicly available. researchers are expected to maximize the appropriate sharing of scientific data generated from nih-funded or conducted research, consistent with privacy, security, informed consent, and proprietary issues. data resources produced with support from this initiative may be available without restriction to researchers or may be subject to restricted access to ensure respondent confidentiality.to encourage maximum use of all data resources produced by this foa, nichd requires that relevant data, associated metadata, and characterization of sample sources and preparation will be made available to the research community via sharing through an appropriate repository, consistent with achieving the goals of this program. as a term of the award, grantees agree to make final data and documentation broadly available to scientific researchers no later than the end of the award period, as appropriate and consistent with achieving the goals of the program.specific areas of interestexamples of activities encouraged by this foa include, but are not limited to:applications should propose archiving activities for existing data that are within the scientific mission of nichd. the highest priority is archiving original data collected with nichd funding.non-responsivenessthe following activities will be considered non-responsive to this foa and will not be reviewed: :data management and sharing planall applications submitted in response to this foa are required to include a data management and sharing plan (plan) and detailed timeline. applications without a plan and timeline will be considered incomplete.data preservation and sharing timelines should make scientific data accessible as soon as possible and no later than the end of the award period. the plan is expected to address the elements as described in supplemental information to the nih policy for data management and sharing: elements of an nih data management and sharing plan (not-od-21-014).grantees are required to share data produced with this r03 support through an existing public data repository and are strongly encouraged to submit their data in an nichd-supported public archive such as the nichd data and specimen hub (dash), data sharing for demographic research (dsdr), or databrary. information on selecting a data repository is available through the nih scientific data sharing website.for non-human data, nichd expects awardees to share data and/or biospecimens through equivalent broad-sharing data and/or biospecimen repositories. researchers can submit information about the location and availability of non-human data and biospecimens to the dash catalog, if applicable.all grantees will be required to comply with their approved plan and any approved updates.see section viii. other information for award authorities and

review process. applications submitted to the nih in support of the nih mission are evaluated for scientific and technical merit through the nih peer review system.for this particular announcement, note the following:the r03 small grant supports discrete, well-defined projects that realistically can be completed in two years and that require limited levels of funding. because the research project usually is limited, an r03 grant application may not contain extensive detail or discussion. accordingly, reviewers should evaluate the conceptual framework and general approach to the problem. appropriate justification for the proposed work can be provided through literature citations, data from other sources, or from investigator-generated data. preliminary data are not required, particularly in applications proposing pilot or feasibility studies.overall impactreviewers will provide an overall impact score to reflect their assessment of the likelihood for the project to exert a sustained, powerful influence on the research field(s) involved, in consideration of the following review criteria and additional review criteria (as applicable for the project proposed).scored review criteriareviewers will consider each of the review criteria below in the determination of scientific merit and give a separate score for each. an application does not need to be strong in all categories to be judged likely to have major scientific impact. for example, a project that by its nature is not innovative may be essential to advance a field.significancedoes the project address an important problem or a critical barrier to progress in the field? is the prior research that serves as the key support for the proposed project rigorous? if the aims of the project are achieved, how will scientific knowledge, technical capability, and/or clinical practice be improved? how will successful completion of the aims change the concepts, methods, technologies, treatments, services, or preventative interventions that drive this field?does the project propose to create or preserve a data resource that will be available for secondary analyses to address an important problem or critical barrier to scientific progress?investigator(s)are the pd(s)/pi(s), collaborators, and other researchers well suited to the project? if early stage investigators or those in the early stages of independent careers, do they have appropriate experience and training? if established, have they demonstrated an ongoing record of accomplishments that have advanced their field(s)? if the project is collaborative or multi-pd/pi, do the investigators have complementary and integrated expertise; are their leadership approach, governance, and organizational structure appropriate for the project?innovationdoes the application challenge and seek to shift current research or clinical practice paradigms by utilizing novel theoretical concepts, approaches or methodologies, instrumentation, or interventions? are the concepts, approaches or methodologies, instrumentation, or interventions novel to one field of research or novel in a broad sense? is a refinement, improvement, or new application of theoretical concepts, approaches or methodologies, instrumentation, or interventions proposed?is the project likely to produce a data resource that will support research that will challenge and seek to shift current research or clinical practice paradigms by utilizing novel theoretical concepts, approaches or methodologies, instrumentation, or interventions?approachare the overall strategy, methodology, and analyses well-reasoned and appropriate to accomplish the specific aims of the project? have the investigators included plans to address weaknesses in the rigor of prior research that serves as the key support for the proposed project? have the investigators presented strategies to ensure a robust and unbiased approach, as appropriate for the work proposed? are potential problems, alternative strategies, and benchmarks for success presented? if the project is in the early stages of development, will the strategy establish feasibility and will particularly risky aspects be managed? have the investigators presented adequate plans to address relevant biological variables, such as sex, for studies in vertebrate animals or human subjects?if the project involves human subjects and/or nih-defined clinical research, are the plans to address 1) the protection of human subjects from research risks, and 2) inclusion (or exclusion) of individuals on the basis of sex/gender, race, and ethnicity, as well as the inclusion or exclusion of individuals of all ages (including children and older adults), justified in terms of the scientific goals and research strategy proposed?environmentwill the scientific environment in which the work will be done contribute to the probability of success? are the institutional support, equipment, and other physical resources available to the investigators adequate for the project proposed? will the project benefit from unique features of the scientific environment, subject populations, or collaborative arrangements?additional review criteriaas applicable for the project proposed, reviewers will evaluate the following additional items while determining scientific and technical merit, and in providing an overall impact score, but will not give separate scores for these items.data management and sharing planreviewers will comment on whether the plan is reasonable and consistent with achieving the goals of the program. elements of the required plan include:protections for human subjectsfor research that involves human subjects but does not involve one of the categories of research that are exempt under 45 cfr part 46, the committee will evaluate the justification for involvement of human subjects and the proposed protections from research risk relating to their participation according to the following five review criteria: 1) risk to subjects, 2) adequacy of protection against risks, 3) potential benefits to the subjects and others, 4) importance of the knowledge to be gained, and 5) data and safety monitoring for clinical trials.for research that involves human subjects and meets the criteria for one or more of the categories of research that
