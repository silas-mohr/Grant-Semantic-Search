https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/pa-files/PAR-21-183.html
national institutes of health (nih)national institute on drug abuse (nida)ug3/uh3 exploratory/developmental phased award cooperative agreement see notices of special interest associated with this funding opportunitysee section iii. 3. additional information on eligibility.the purpose of this funding opportunity announcement (foa) is to accelerate the development of digital therapeutics (dtx) to treat substance use disorders (suds). advances in technology offer unprecedented opportunities to develop clinical-grade mobile, web, or other software-based platforms designed to deliver treatments that are safe and effective for sud. fda authorization of dtx can play an important role in increasing the availability of treatments to patients with sud.the primary objective of this foa is to move dtx to their next step in the development process, with the ultimate goal of generating new, fda authorized, disseminated treatments for suds. applications may focus on the pre-clinical and/or clinical development and testing of new dtx or existing dtx developed for other indications.the ug3/uh3 cooperative agreement involves 2 phases. the ug3 phase, for up to 2 years, is designed to support a project with specific milestones to be accomplished by the end of the period. the uh3 phase is to provide funding for up to 3 additional years following successful completion of the ug3. ug3 projects that meet their milestones will be administratively considered by nida and prioritized for transition to the uh3 phase. investigators submitting to this foa must address both ug3 and uh3 phases.30 days prior to the application due datedates in bold italics in the following table were modified per issuance of not-da-21-042.application due datesreview and award cyclesnewrenewal / resubmission / revision (as allowed)aidsscientific merit reviewadvisory council reviewearliest start dateaugust 4, 2021august 4, 2021august 4, 2021november 2021january 2022april 2022december 6, 2021december 6, 2021december 6, 2021march 2022may 2022july 2022april 6, 2022april 6, 2022april 6, 2022july 2022october 2022december 2022august 4, 2022august 4, 2022august 4, 2022november 2022january 2023april 2023december 6, 2022december 6, 2022december 6, 2022march 2023may 2023july 2023april 6, 2023april 6, 2023april 6, 2023july 2023october 2023december 2023august 4, 2023august 4, 2023august 4, 2023november 2023january 2024april 2024december 6, 2023december 6, 2023december 6, 2023march 2024may 2024july 2024all applications are due by 5:00 pm local time of applicant organization. all types of non-aids applications allowed for this funding opportunity announcement are due on the listed date(s).applicants are encouraged to apply early to allow adequate time to make any corrections to errors found in the application during the submission process by the due date.new date december 7, 2023 per issuance of not-da-21-042. (original expiration date: january 11, 2024)not applicableit is critical that applicants follow the instructions in the research (r) instructions in the sf424 (r&r) application guide,except where instructed to do otherwise (in this foa or in a notice from nih guide for grants and contracts ).conformance to all requirements (both in the application guide and the foa) is required and strictly enforced. applicants must read and follow all application instructions in the application guide as well as any program-specific instructions noted in section iv. when the program-specific instructions deviate from those in the application guide, follow the program-specific instructions.applications that do not comply with these instructions may be delayed or not accepted for review.there are several options available to submit your application through grants.gov to nih and department of health and human services partners. you must use one of these submission options to access the application forms for this opportunity.backgroundsubstance use disorders (suds) continue to have a significant adverse impact in the united states, resulting in more than $700 billion annually in health care expenditures, lost earnings, and expenses. the prevalence of sud is widespread, with approximately 21.6 million individuals over the age of 12 experiencing substance use or dependence. there are safe and effective fda approved medications for opioid and nicotine use disorders, but the long-term success rate is low. there are no fda approved medications for other suds. behavioral therapies for suds, delivered directly between a therapist and patient, have shown efficacy but the drug use relapse rates are high. new device and digital technologies are being investigated, and these interventions have only recently started achieving fda authorization. expanded development of safe and effective digital therapeutics for suds represents a new opportunity to address the high public health need for new sud interventions.digital therapeutics (dtx) are clinical-grade mobile, web, or other software-based platforms designed to deliver treatments for medical conditions or diseases. these therapeutic interventions do not include wellness apps or telehealth which provides remote access to a clinician. instead, dtx can deliver new behavioral interventions or those that have previously only been available for delivery through direct, face-to-face interactions with a clinician. dtx can provide therapeutic opportunities beyond those that are available under current standard of sud care. for example, the delivery of a behavioral intervention by dtx ensures it is provided in a highly reproducible manner. dtx are available 24 hours a day, whenever a patient might need support. access is not affected by transportation challenges to a clinician, or by when a patient might have the time available to visit a clinician. privacy can be ensured by providing discreet and confidential care, avoiding the challenges of stigma around the potential for public exposure of receiving treatment. dtx can be highly scalable, increasing access at low cost. over the last several years, the fda has provided a pathway for authorization of dtx and there already has been approval of dtx for sud. however, more work is needed to expand on the types of treatments delivered, the technologies used for delivery, that target special populations or specific suds, or other aspects that can increase the efficacy and reach of treatment using dtx.research objectivesthe goal is to support research into the development and testing of dtx for stand-alone treatments or dtx integrated with fda-approved sud treatments. stand-alone dtx treatments may, for example, deliver behavioral interventions that are currently accessed via face-to-face interactions with a therapist. the treatment may be completely delivered by the dtx, or it may include reduced numbers of face-to-face interactions with a therapist. however, it is intended that no other intervention is included in a stand-alone treatment. approaches integrated with fda-approved sud treatments would support and enhance the effect of the treatments. indications targeted by the interventions could include: prevention of the initiation of suds, increasing medication adherence, enhancing treatment retention, treatment of withdrawal, initiation of abstinence, or reduction of relapse.investigators are strongly encouraged to reach out to the appropriate fda center for devices and radiological health (cdrh) office via the pre-submission process to discuss the proposed development pathway and clinical validation data requirements. guidance on this process can be found here: q submission process. questions for discussion in a pre-submission could include: whether a dtx would meet the definition of a medical device and require fda oversight; the most appropriate regulatory pathway for a dtx if it does meet the definition of a medical device; whether a clinical trial investigating the safety and effectiveness of an investigational dtx would represent a significant risk study and require prior investigational device exemption (ide) approval. additional discussions can include clinical study design considerations (including feedback on the proposed patient population, study endpoints and assessments, statistical analysis plan, study comparator, and others) to support the safety and effectiveness of the dtx for a particular use indication.sham comparators or validated active comparators should be included when appropriate. if applicable, investigators should design studies to evaluate potential sex/gender differences. methods to evaluate subjects' compliance with the study treatments should be included when possible. monitoring adherence to the treatment would be especially appropriate for dtx that are integrated with fda-approved sud interventions.applicants should consult with nida staff when developing plans for an application (see agency contacts, section vii). this early contact will provide an opportunity to clarify nida policies and guidelines, identify whether the proposed project is consistent with nida program priorities, and discuss how to develop an appropriate project timeline, which is subject to peer review.ug3/uh3 phases of researchthis foa uses a phased innovation approach (ug3/uh3). the ug3 phase provides support for up to two years with specific milestones and go/no-go rules, determined by the investigator, to be accomplished by the end of the ug3 phase. the milestones and go/no-go rules must be based on quantifiable measures and designed around what needs to be achieved to reach the next stage of development.applicants must plan for both the ug3 and uh3 phase. at the completion of the ug3, the grant will undergo administrative review by nida staff to determine if the milestones are successfully met. following review, the application may then be awarded up to 3 additional years of support (uh3 phase).the ug3 phasethe focus of the ug3 phase should be on moving the intervention forward to the next stage of design and testing, providing milestones relevant to the fda authorization pathway. the specific activities and milestones appropriate for the ug3 phase will depend on the type of intervention under study and its stage of development. grant applications should provide clear, measurable milestones and go/no-go rules to be accomplished at the end of the ug3.activities for the ug3 may include:the uh3 phasefunding for the uh3 phase is contingent on successfully meeting the milestones in the ug3 phase (see section vi. award administration information, 1. award notices for further information). the uh3 phase supports the next step in the development of the intervention and progression towards fda authorization. applicants are expected to describe the entry and exit points of the proposed research in the development continuum. the application should provide quantifiable milestones to determine success of the uh3.activities for the uh3 are contingent upon the milestones defined and accomplished in the ug3 and availability of funds.special considerationsnational advisory council on drug abuse recommended guidelines for the administration of drugs to human

defense authorization act of fiscal year 2009 (public law 110-417), nih awards will be subject to the federal awardee performance and integrity information system (fapiis) requirements. fapiis requires federal award making officials to review and consider information about an applicant in the designated integrity and performance system (currently fapiis) prior to making an award. an applicant, at its option, may review information in the designated integrity and performance systems accessible through fapiis and comment on any information about itself that a federal agency previously entered and is currently in fapiis. the federal awarding agency will consider any comments by the applicant, in addition to other information in fapiis, in making a judgement about the applicant’s integrity, business ethics, and record of performance under federal awards when completing the review of risk posed by applicants as described in 45 cfr part 75.205 “federal awarding agency review of risk posed by applicants.” this provision will apply to all nih grants and cooperative agreements except fellowships.the following special terms of award are in addition to, and not in lieu of, otherwise applicable u.s. office of management and budget (omb) administrative guidelines, u.s. department of health and human services (dhhs) grant administration regulations at 45 cfr parts 75, and other hhs, phs, and nih grant administration policies.the administrative and funding instrument used for this project will be the cooperative agreement, an "assistance" mechanism (rather than an "acquisition" mechanism), in which substantial nih programmatic involvement with the awardees is anticipated during the performance of the activities. under the cooperative agreement, the nih purpose is to support and stimulate the recipients' activities by involvement in and otherwise working jointly with the award recipients in a partnership role; it is not to assume direction, prime responsibility, or a dominant role in the activities. consistent with this concept, the dominant role and prime responsibility resides with the awardees for the project, although specific tasks and activities may be shared among the awardees and the nih as defined below.the pd(s)/pi(s) will have the primary responsibility for:all aspects of their study, including any modification of study design, conduct of the study, quality control, data analysis and interpretation, preparation of publications, dissemination of data, tools, and technologies, and collaboration with other investigators.the awardee agrees to accept close coordination, cooperation, and participation of nih staff in those aspects of scientific and technical management of the study including those outlined under "nih responsibilities".awardees will participate in annual meetings of the awardees and will support any committees, task forces, and advisory panels as needed.upon implementation of the protocol, each field center, whether a single institution or a consortium of institutions, will follow the procedures required by the protocol regarding study conduct and monitoring, patient management, and data collection.support or other involvement of industry or any other third party in the study--e.g., participation by the third party; involvement of project resources or citing the name of the project or the nih support; or special access to project results, data, findings, or resources--may be advantageous and appropriate. however, except for licensing of patents or copyrights, support or involvement of any.award recipients will own the rights in any tangible work products created under the terms of the cooperative agreement. work products may include such things as research reports, papers, research, findings, training curricula, data sets, books, patient tools, and other materials. all such products shall be made accessible to the public and are subject to government rights of access, as appropriate, in accordance with nih’s legal directives and authorities.nih staff have substantial programmatic involvement that is above and beyond the normal stewardship role in awards, as described below:the nih project scientist will have access to the data and work with the pd(s)/pi(s) to ensure the objectives of the program are being met. the primary responsibility for the program resides with the awardee, although specific tasks and activities will be shared among the awardee and the nih project scientist.the nih reserves the right to phase out or curtail the award (or an individual component of the award) in the event of inadequate progress or data reporting.nih support of this study is contingent upon adequate participant recruitment based on the grantee’s milestone accrual plan submitted at the time of funding.the grantee is expected to demonstrate best effort compliance. failure to achieve minimally acceptable milestone recruitment levels may result in the withholding future support and or negotiating an orderly close-out of this study.nih staff will act as a resource and facilitator for activities of the awardee with non-hcs researchers and other nih, dhhs, or other federally-sponsored research networks that may be relevant to this effort.serve as a resource to provide scientific/programmatic support during the accomplishment of the clinical trial by participating in the design of the activities, advising in the selection of sources or resources, advising in management and technical performance, or participating in the preparation of publications.participate in the monitoring of issues relating to recruitment, retention and follow-up of study participants, and monitoring of data integrity and quality control through consideration of the annual reports, site visits, patient logs, etc. this review may include, but is not limited to, compliance with the study protocol, meeting patient enrollment targets, adherence to uniform data collection procedures, and the timeliness and quality of data reporting as needed.assist in the development and modification of study protocols.areas of joint responsibility include:the pd(s)/pi(s) provide, in concert with the nih staff, support necessary to ensure that sites and investigators, and nih and other research partners fully comply with federal regulatory requirements, including but not limited to those relating to human subjects protections, informed consent, and reporting of adverse events.awardees and nih will jointly develop appropriate confidentiality procedures for data collection, processing, storage and analysis to ensure the confidentiality of data on individual health care provider organization patients, health care providers and other institutions.all awardees and nih will cooperate to ensure the timely and broad dissemination of lessons learned, to inform researchers and health care systems engaged in research in health care settings.dispute resolution:any disagreements that may arise in scientific or programmatic matters (within the scope of the award) between award recipients and the nih may be brought to dispute resolution. a dispute resolution panel composed of three members will be convened. it will have three members: a designee of the investigator chosen without nih staff voting from among the pi of the foa, one nih designee, and a third designee with expertise in the relevant area who is chosen by the other two; in the case of individual disagreement, the first member may be chosen by the individual awardee. this special dispute resolution procedure does not alter the awardee's right to appeal an adverse action that is otherwise appealable in accordance with phs regulation 42 cfr part 50, subpart d and dhhs regulation 45 cfr part 16.data management and sharingnote: the nih policy for data management and sharing is effective for due dates on or after january 25, 2023.consistent with the nih policy for data management and sharing, when data management and sharing is applicable to the award, recipients will be required to adhere to the data management and sharing requirements as outlined in the nih grants policy statement. upon the approval of a data management and sharing plan, it is required for recipients to implement the plan as described.a final rppr, invention statement, and the expenditure data portion of the federal financial report are required for closeout of an award, as described in the nih grants policy statement.the federal funding accountability and transparency act of 2006 (transparency act), includes a requirement for awardees of federal grants to report information about first-tier subawards and executive compensation under federal assistance awards issued in fy2011 or later. all awardees of applicable nih grants and cooperative agreements are required to report to the federal subaward reporting system (fsrs) available at www.fsrs.gov on all subawards over
