this mentored research scientist development award in implementation science for substance use prevention and treatment (k01) is to provide support and “protected time” (3-5 years) for an intensive, supervised career development experience leading to research independence in this area of specialization.realizing the return on public investment in the development of evidence-based treatments and preventive interventions to address the ongoing overdose crisis depends on a cadre of skilled researchers with expertise in implementation science, who can help move these interventions into routine practice. implementation science focuses on identifying modifiable barriers to the uptake and sustained use of evidence-based practices in real world settings and developing replicable and scalable strategies to overcome those barriers. while this field has grown rapidly over the past 15 years, there remain a limited number of independent researchers with dual expertise in addiction research and implementation science, constraining the field’s capacity to respond to continued calls for research in this area. there is a pressing need for a deeper bench of researchers who can be called upon to meet ongoing and emerging implementation challenges in the addiction field.this funding opportunity announcement (foa) will support early career investigators who have foundational training in substance use prevention or treatment research and will provide support and protected time to acquire training and research experience in implementation science. development and execution of an independent nih-defined clinical trial applying implementation science methods to one of the four domains of the hhs overdose prevention strategy (prevention; evidence-based addiction treatment; harm reduction; or recovery research) is required.this funding opportunity announcement (foa) is designed specifically for applicants proposing to serve as the lead investigator of an independent clinical trial, a clinical trial feasibility study, or a separate ancillary study to an existing trial, as part of their research and career development. applicants not planning an independent clinical trial, or proposing to gain research experience in a clinical trial led by another investigator, should consult the nih research career development awards website for alternative funding opportunities.not applicableall applications are due by 5:00 pm local time of applicant organization.applications are encouraged to apply early to allow adequate time to make any corrections to errors found in the application during the submission process by the due date.not applicableit is critical that applicants follow the instructions in the career development (k) instructions in the sf424 (r&r) application guide, except where instructed to do otherwise (in this foa or in a notice from the nih guide for grants and contracts). conformance to all requirements (both in the application guide and the foa) is required and strictly enforced. applicants must read and follow all application instructions in the application guide as well as any program-specific instructions noted in section iv. when the program-specific instructions deviate from those in the application guide, follow the program-specific instructions. applications that do not comply with these instructions may be delayed or not accepted for review.there are several options available to submit your application through grants.gov to nih and department of health and human services partners. you must use one of these submission options to access the application forms for this opportunity.the overall goal of the nih research career development program is to help ensure that a diverse pool of highly trained scientists is available in appropriate scientific disciplines to address the nation's biomedical, behavioral, and clinical research needs. nih institutes and centers (ics) support a variety of mentored and non-mentored career development award programs designed to foster the transition of new investigators to research independence and to support established investigators in achieving specific objectives. candidates should review the different career development (k) award programs to determine the best program to support their goals. more information about career programs may be found at the nih extramural training mechanisms website.the objective of the nih mentored research scientist development award (k01) is to provide salary and research support for a sustained period of “protected time” (3-5 years) for intensive research career development, under the guidance of an experienced mentor, or sponsor in the biomedical, behavioral or clinical sciences leading to research independence. the expectation is that, through this sustained period of research career development and training, recipients will launch independent research careers and become competitive for new research project grant (e.g., r01) funding.this funding opportunity announcement (foa) is part of the nih helping to end addiction long-term (heal) initiative to speed scientific solutions to the national opioid public health crisis. the nih heal initiative bolsters research across nih to (1) improve treatment for opioid misuse and addiction and (2) enhance pain management. more information about the heal initiative is available at: https://heal.nih.gov/.successfully addressing the ongoing overdose epidemic requires a cadre of skilled researchers who can move existing and emerging evidence-based treatment and prevention practices into routine use. the discipline best positioned to develop scalable, sustainable strategies to move research findings into practice is implementation science. this foa invites career development applications proposing research projects that will identify, develop, test, evaluate, and/or refine strategies to disseminate and implement interventions and services aligned with the hhs overdose prevention strategy (i.e., prevention; evidence-based addiction treatment; harm reduction; and/or recovery support services). applicants may also focus on strategies to promote the de-implementation of outdated, ineffective, or harmful practices in these domains.addressing the overdose crisis also requires recognition that patients may have a complex array of clinical and social needs. as such, this foa is also open to researchers with an interest in integrating evidence-based prevention and treatment services for opioids and common co-occurring conditions, including alcohol misuse/alcohol use disorder, mental illness, and/or hiv. all applications should be within the scope of the mission of at least one of the participating institutes/centers.applicants should focus on testing implementation strategies to improve the quality, effectiveness, availability, and affordability of substance use prevention or treatment services; to promote their integration and accessibility across a variety of settings (e.g., specialty care, primary care, schools, workplaces, and other nontraditional healthcare and community settings); and to promote equity in access and outcomes.examples of research projects that fall within the scope of this foa include, but are not limited to:nimh is particularly interested in applications that focus on implementation science for the prevention and treatment of co-occurring substance use and mental illness. for example, through the heal initiative, nimh leads a portfolio of research to help improve the provision of services for people with co-occurring opioid use disorder and mental disorders and/or suicide risk. it is strongly recommended that nimh mentored k01 applicants review the following guidance, which includes following nimh's experimental therapeutics approach to intervention development: https://www.nimh.nih.gov/funding/training/career-development-programs-k-series#12in developing research projects, applicants are strongly encouraged to address issues of patient/stakeholder engagement; scalability beyond the study sites/settings; sustainability beyond the funding period; and whether the proposed implementation strategy/process reduces inequities in service availability, access, utilization, cost, quality, or outcomes.clinical trial required: this funding opportunity announcement (foa) is designed specifically for applicants proposing to serve as the lead investigator of an independent clinical trial, a clinical trial feasibility study, or a separate ancillary clinical trial, as part of their research and career development. nih defines a clinical trial as "a research study in which one or more human subjects are prospectively assigned to one or more interventions (which may include placebo or other control) to evaluate the effects of those interventions on health-related biomedical or behavioral outcomes." most implementation trials – including those that randomize at the organization, system or community level – meet this definition. for additional details and frequently asked questions, visit https://grants.nih.gov/policy/clinical-trials/definition.htmnote: this foa is restricted only to individuals who (1) have foundational training or career experience in prevention, treatment or services research on substance use or substance use and co-occurring mental illness; (2) are seeking a sustained period of protected time for mentored training and research applying implementation science methods to one of the domains of the hhs overdose prevention strategy; and (3) are proposing to conduct an independent nih-defined clinical trial as part of this award. applicants not meeting all three of these criteria should consult the nih research career development awards website for alternative funding opportunities.applicants should clearly justify the duration of requested support, taking into consideration prior research experience and the proposed mentored career development goals that are essential for developing an independent, nih-funded research program at the intersection of substance use and implementation science. projects may not exceed 5 years.applications should include a clear plan for career development activities that will support the candidate’s transition to research independence, including milestones, and evidence of significant institutional commitment to the continued development of the k01 candidate as an independent researcher at the applicant institution. applicants are expected to plan to apply for independent research support during the later years of their mentored career award.special considerations:pre-application consultation: potential applicants are strongly encouraged to consult with nih program staff early in the application development process. this early contact will provide an opportunity to discuss and clarify nih policies and guidelines, including the scope of the project relative to the heal initiative mission and intent of this foa. see scientific/research contacts in section vii of this foa.pi meeting attendance: the nih heal initiative will require a high level of coordination and sharing between investigators. it is expected that nih heal initiative grant recipients will cooperate and coordinate their activities after awards are made by participating in program director/principal investigator (pd/pi) meetings, including an annual heal investigators meeting, as well as other activities.diversity: in addition to scientific diversity, applicants should strive to address diversity in their team development plan. research shows that diverse teams working together and capitalizing on innovative ideas and distinct perspectives outperform homogenous teams. scientists and trainees from diverse backgrounds and life experiences bring different perspectives, creativity, and individual enterprise to address complex scientific problems. there are many benefits that flow from a diverse nih-supported scientific workforce, including: fostering scientific innovation, enhancing global competitiveness, contributing to robust learning environments, improving the quality of the research, advancing the likelihood that underserved or health disparity populations participate in, and benefit from health research, and enhancing public trust. in spite of tremendous advancements in scientific research, information, educational and research opportunities are not equally available to all. nih encourages institutions to diversify their student and faculty populations to enhance the participation of individuals from groups that are underrepresented in the biomedical, clinical, behavioral and social sciences, such as: individuals from underrepresented racial and ethnic groups, individuals with disabilities, individuals from disadvantaged backgrounds, and women at senior faculty levels. please refer to notice of nih's interest in diversity not-od-20-031 for more details.data harmonization for substance abuse, addiction, and mental disorders via the phenx toolkit: applicants involved in human-subjects studies are strongly encouraged to employ a common set of tools and resources that will promote the collection of comparable data across studies and to do so by incorporating the measures from the core and specialty collections, which are available in the substance abuse and addiction collection and the mental health collection of the phenx toolkit (www.phenxtoolkit.org). please see not-da-12-008 (http://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/not-da-12-008.html) for further details.nimh common data elements: nimh encourages the use of common data elements (cdes) in basic, clinical, and applied research, patient registries, and other human subject research to facilitate broader and more effective use of data and advance research across studies. cdes are data elements that have been identified and defined for use in multiple data sets across different studies. nih has established a "common data element (cde) resource portal" (http://cde.nih.gov/) to assist investigators in identifying nih-supported cdes when developing protocols, case report forms, and other instruments for data collection. the portal provides guidance about and access to nih-supported cde initiatives and other tools and resources for the appropriate use of cdes and data standards in nih-funded research. investigators are encouraged to consult the portal and describe in their applications any use they will make of nih-supported cdes in their projects.points to consider regarding tobacco industry funding of nida applicants:the national advisory council on drug abuse (nacda) encourages nida and its grantees to consider the points it has set forth regarding existing or prospective sponsored research agreements with tobacco companies or their related entities and the impact of acceptance of tobacco industry funding on nida's credibility and reputation within the scientific community. please see https://nida.nih.gov/about-nida/advisory-boards-groups/national-advisory-council-drug-abuse-nacda/points-to-consider-regarding-tobacco-industry-funding-nida-applicants-fnote: this funding opportunity announcement (foa) is designed specifically for candidates proposing to serve as the lead investigator of an independent clinical trial, a clinical trial feasibility study, or a separate ancillary clinical trial, as part of their research and career development. those not planning an independent clinical trial, or proposing to gain research experience in a clinical trial led by another investigator, should consult the nih research career development awards website for alternative funding opportunities.investigators proposing nih-defined clinical trials may refer to the research methods resources website for information about developing statistical methods and study designs.see section viii. other information for award authorities and regulations.grant: a support mechanism providing money, property, or both to an eligible entity to carry out an approved project or activity.required: only accepting applications that propose an independent clinical trial(s).nih intends to commit approximately $1.1 million total in fy2023, spread across pas-22-206 and pas-22-207. up to 6 total awards across these two foas are anticipated. similar commitments are expected for fy2024, contingent upon availability of funds and receipt of a sufficient number of meritorious applications.the total project period must be a minimum of 3 but no more than 5 years.applicants may request salary support up to $90,000 plus fringe benefits per year, consistent with their institution’s salary scale. a minimum of 9 person months (75% effort) must be devoted to the career award. further guidance on budgeting for career development salaries is provided in the sf424 (r&r) application guide. see also not-od-17-094.in addition, the candidate may derive additional compensation for effort associated with other federal sources or awards provided the total salary derived from all federal sources does not exceed the maximum legislated salary rate (see http://grants.nih.gov/grants/policy/salcap_summary.html) and the total percent effort does not exceed 100%. see also not-od-17-094.nih will contribute $50,000 per year toward the research development
