medical sciences (nigms), along with the other participating nih institutes, centers, and offices (icos) announce the availability of administrative supplements to idea awards to expand research and research capacity in the idea states to address important issues of women’s health across the lifespan. the proposed research must be within the scope of the parent grant and must address at least one of the strategic goals of the 2019-2023 trans-nih strategic plan for women's health research "advancing science for the health of women."backgroundorwh is the public health service office dedicated specifically to promote women's health research within and beyond the nih scientific community. orwh was established in september 1990 by congressional mandate.congress assigned a far-reaching leadership role for orwh by mandating that orwh serves as the focal point for coordinating women’s health research at the nih. orwh crafts and implements the trans-nih strategic plan for women's health research in partnership with nih ics and co-funds research on the role of sex and gender on health, with the ultimate goal of advancing rigorous research relevant to the health of women. orwh also collaborates with nih ics, the nih office of extramural research, and the nih office of intramural research to monitor adherence to nih's inclusion policies for research involving human subjects, which ensure that women and minorities are represented in nih-supported clinical research. orwh's interdisciplinary research and career development initiatives stimulate research on sex and gender differences and provide career support to launch promising women's health researchers. these programs set the stage for improved health for women and their families and career opportunities and advancement for a diverse biomedical workforce.the institutional development award (idea) program is congressionally mandated and administered by nigms. it supports research and research capacity building in states that historically have had low levels of nih funding through a variety of funding mechanisms. the idea program has been instrumental in increasing the pool of early stage investigators (esis) from idea states who apply for nih research project grants and in strengthening research infrastructure in those states.residents in idea states, especially those living in rural areas, often have less access to health care and suffer from poorer health outcomes, including health outcomes for women and children, than the average american. for example, several idea states are among the states with the highest maternal and infant mortality rates. these administrative supplements aim to increase research specifically directed at women’s health and health disparities and to expand the capacity of idea states to conduct women’s health research.research objectivesthis nosi encourages a broad range of research addressing important issues of women’s health across the lifespan, with a special interest in maternal and infant morbidity and mortality, including their underlying causes.eligibilityeligible institutionsinstitutional eligibility for this supplement
