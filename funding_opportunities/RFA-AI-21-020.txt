national institutes of health (nih)national institute of allergy and infectious diseases (niaid)u01 research project – cooperative agreements see notices of special interest associated with this funding opportunitysee section iii. 3. additional information on eligibility.the purpose of this funding opportunity announcement (foa) is to solicit applications for the development of enabling data science technologies to improve the acquisition, management, analysis, visualization, and dissemination of data and knowledge for immune-mediated and infectious diseases including disease mechanism, risk prediction, epidemiology, detection and diagnosis, treatment and vaccines across the allergy, immune-mediated, and infectious-disease research continuum, aligned with the research mission of niaid. this includes infectious diseases, emerging infections, or immune-mediated diseases that include allergy, autoimmunity, or immune reactions associated with transplantation.as a part of the trans-niaid data science program, this foa focuses on early-stage development from prototyping to hardening and adaptation. early-stage development is defined for the purpose of this foa as initial tool development or the significant modification of existing tools for new applications. this contrasts with exploratory (r21) and enhancement/sustainment (u24) efforts to generate these tools and resources that are supported by the companion foas.30 days prior to the application due dateall applications are due by 5:00 pm local time of applicant organization. all types of non-aids applications allowed for this funding opportunity announcement are due on the listed date(s).applicants are encouraged to apply early to allow adequate time to make any corrections to errors found in the application during the submission process by the due date.not applicableit is critical that applicants follow the instructions in the research (r) instructions in the sf424 (r&r) application guide, except where instructed to do otherwise (in this foa or in a notice from nih guide for grants and contracts).conformance to all requirements (both in the application guide and the foa) is required and strictly enforced. applicants must read and follow all application instructions in the application guide as well as any program-specific instructions noted in section iv. when the program-specific instructions deviate from those in the application guide, follow the program-specific instructions.applications that do not comply with these instructions may be delayed or not accepted for

access the application forms for this opportunity.purposethe purpose of this funding opportunity announcement (foa) is to solicit applications for the development of enabling data science technologies to improve the acquisition, management, analysis, visualization, and dissemination of data and knowledge for immune-mediated and infectious diseases including disease mechanism, risk prediction, epidemiology, detection and diagnosis, treatment and vaccines addressing priority needs across the infectious or immune-mediated disease research continuum aligned with the research mission of niaid. this includes infectious diseases, emerging infections, or immune-mediated diseases that include allergy, autoimmunity, or immune reactions associated with transplantation.as one of the three foas in the trans-niaid data science program, this foa encourages applications focused on early-stage development from prototyping to hardening and adaptation. early-stage development is defined for the purpose of this foa as initial tool development or the significant modification of existing tools for new applications. this contrasts with exploratory (r21) and enhancement/sustainment (u24) development efforts to generate these tools and resources that are supported by the companion foas.backgroundniaid's basic and clinical research projects are generating large, diverse and complex data sets, including genomics/omics data, clinical data, immune phenotyping assay data, and imaging data. similarly, the infectious and immune-mediated diseases research communities have become a data-intense enterprise. niaid recognizes that there is a critical need to transform these data into knowledge to better understand pathogen transmission and evolution, pathogen-host interactions, host immune response, infectious and immune-mediated disease pathogenesis, as well as to develop new and improved diagnostics, therapeutics, and vaccines. hence the need for findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (fair) software solutions that are innovative and sustainable.in response to these complex data requirements niaid is launching three trans-niaid initiatives (rfa-ai-21-035, rfa-ai-21-020, and rfa-ai-21-021) to support investigator-initiated informatics and data science researchers, driven by critical research needs in infectious or immune-mediated disease research. the objective is to expand niaid's commitment to promote informatics solutions and harness the power of data science to maximize the institute’s potential to accelerate discoveries in niaid’s research. the three companion foa's will also provide new funding opportunities and demonstrate niaid’s commitment to informatics and data science research.the companion foa's of the ai-ds program include:these niaid data-science program foas aim to promote research-driven data science technology across the development lifecycle to address priority needs in immune-mediated and infectious disease research with a clear rationale for the needs of the technology proposed and their benefit to immune-mediated and infectious disease research through user feedback.specific research objectivethis foa encourages applications focused on early-stage development from prototyping to hardening and adaptation of informatics and data science technologies that support a wide range of immune-mediated and infectious disease research including, but not limited to disease mechanism, risk prediction, epidemiology, detection and diagnosis, treatment and vaccines. the emphasis will be on uniqueness and potential impact on immune-mediated and infectious disease research.some examples of potential projects relevant to this foa include but are not limited to the following:applications including the following types of studies will be considered non-responsive and will not be reviewed:note: this foa differs from the companion foas, rfa-ai-21-035 (r21) and rfa-ai-21-021 (u24), because it uses the u01 cooperative agreement mechanism. proof of concept projects that are high risk and/or paradigm shifting may be suitable for the r21 foa. the u01 will support more advanced projects including early-stage tool development from prototyping to hardening and adaptation. the u24 foa will support enhancements to advanced projects and/or sustaining operations to improve the user experience and availability of existing, widely adopted data science tools or software.awardees of the u01 and u24 foas will be expected to participate in additional collaborative research activities identified post-award to enhance the utility and/or interoperability of the data science technology being supported through the awards. these expansion activities are intended to further the impact of the technology that is the subject of the award and may include collaborations with other trans niaid data science program awardees or with other investigators. proposals for collaborative activities will be evaluated by processes established by the steering committee.examples of collaborative projects include, but are not limited to:investigators planning to submit an application in response to this foa are encouraged to contact and discuss their proposed research aims with the scientific contact listed in section vii in advance of the application receipt date.annual programmatic meetingsa kick-off meeting and annual program meetings will be held to establish the major roles and functions of the program and to facilitate collaborations. additionally, annual meetings will report progress, seek new research directions and ideas, and update niaid on issues of need. these meetings will be attended by the pd(s)/pi(s), key personnel, and niaid staff. the location of the meeting will be on a rotating basis at one of the awardee's location who will then take the lead to organize that year's meeting in consultation with the meeting planning committee volunteers and niaid program staff.see section viii. other information for award authorities and regulations.cooperative agreement: a support mechanism used when there will be substantial federal scientific or programmatic involvement. substantial involvement means that, after award, nih scientific or program staff will assist, guide, coordinate, or participate in project activities. see section vi.2 for

45 cfr part 75, and other hhs, phs, and nih grant administration policies. the administrative and funding instrument used for this program will be the cooperative agreement, an "assistance" mechanism (rather than an "acquisition" mechanism), in which substantial nih programmatic involvement with the awardees is anticipated during the performance of the activities. under the cooperative agreement, the nih's purpose is to support and stimulate the recipients' activities by involvement in and otherwise working jointly with the award recipients in a partnership role; it is not to assume direction, prime responsibility, or a dominant role in the activities. consistent with this concept, the dominant role and prime responsibility resides with the awardees for the project as a whole, although specific tasks and activities may be shared among the awardees and the nih as defined below.the pd(s)/pi(s) will have the primary responsibility for:nih staff have substantial programmatic involvement that is above and beyond the normal stewardship role in awards, as described below:areas of joint responsibility include:dispute resolution:any disagreements that may arise in scientific or programmatic matters (within the scope of the award) between award recipients and the nih may be brought to dispute resolution. a dispute resolution panel composed of three members will be convened. it will have three members: a designee of the steering committee chosen without nih staff voting, one nih designee, and a third designee with expertise in the relevant area who is chosen by the other two; in the case of individual disagreement, the first member may be chosen by the individual awardee. this special dispute resolution procedure does not alter the awardee's right to appeal an adverse action that is otherwise appealable in accordance with phs regulation 42 cfr part 50, subpart d and dhhs regulation 45 cfr part 16.a final rppr, invention statement, and the expenditure data portion
