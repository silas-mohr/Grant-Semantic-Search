december 29, 2022pa-20-272 - administrative supplements to existing nih grants and cooperative agreements (parent admin supp clinical trial optional)national cancer institute (nci)this notice of special interest informs current awardees that the national cancer institute (nci) is providing an opportunity for supplemental funding to support exploratory research studies to expand the current understanding of cancer stigma (as defined below), assess its impact on cancer control and prevention, and develop stigma-reduction interventions to improve cancer outcomes in low- and middle-income countries (lmics).the goals of these administrative supplements focused on global cancer stigma research are to: 1) elucidate the etiology and perpetuation of cancer stigma; 2) measure the impact of cancer stigma on physical and mental well-being and associated health behaviors of patients; 3) identify mechanisms and pathways by which stigma is a barrier to cancer prevention, treatment, palliation, and survivorship; and 4) develop interventions to reduce cancer stigma and improve cancer outcomes.backgroundstigma is a powerful social process characterized by labeling and stereotyping of certain human characteristics as socially undesirable and linked with negative stereotypes, leading to loss of status and discrimination towards labeled individuals. moreover, stigma can act as a fundamental barrier to health-seeking behavior, engagement in care and adherence to treatment across a range of health conditions globally, including cancer. stigma manifests across all stages along the cancer care continuum and remains a key challenge for cancer prevention and control. enacted stigma, which is characterized by cancer patients being treated differently and/or being denied opportunities, and internalized stigma, which is characterized by cancer patients avoiding certain situations and/or interactions to prevent anticipated stigmatization, have both been reported to have consequential impacts on affected cancer patientsâ€™ outcomes. in low- and middle-income countries (lmics) where access to traditional health care is limited, stigma may exacerbate the existing barriers to cancer diagnosis, treatment, and palliative care and perpetuate health inequities.within the areas of cancer, the specific research priorities may include, but are not limited to, the following:the nci encourages collaborative research among nci-funded domestic investigators and their foreign counterparts in lmics who have complementary expertise and access to lmic populations. applicants are encouraged to leverage existing resources and partnerships, and to design projects that can reasonably be completed within the given time and budget. where appropriately justified, supplemental funding may be applied towards attaining adequate global populations for cancer stigma research. it is not essential for the parent award to have a cancer stigma research focus. the request for supplemental funding may propose to augment the parent award by integrating cancer stigma research in global populations into the ongoing research project in away (i.e., within its approved scope) that increases its impact.application and submission informationapplications for this initiative must be submitted using the following funding opportunity announcement (foa) or its subsequent reissued equivalent:all instructions in the sf424 (r&r) application guide and pa-20-272 must be followed, with the following additions:eligibility and eligible individuals (program director/principal investigator)budgetrequestspage limitsthese sections have the following page limits:administrative review and selectionthe following criteria will be applied for evaluation of the applications:please direct all inquiries to:vidya vedham, ph.d. national cancer institute (nci) telephone:240-276-7272 email: vidya.vedham@nih.govweekly toc for this announcement nih funding opportunities and noticesnote: for help accessing pdf, rtf, ms word, excel, powerpoint, audio or video files, see help downloading files.
