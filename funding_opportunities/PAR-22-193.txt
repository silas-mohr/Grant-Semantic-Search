forms and instructions must be used for due dates on or after january 25, 2023 - new grant application instructions now availablenot-od-22-190 - adjustments to nih and ahrq grant application due dates between september 22 and september 30, 2022see section iii. 3. additional information on eligibility.this funding opportunity announcement (foa) supports applications for a collaborating data coordinating center (dcc) for investigator-initiated multi-site clinical trials including efficacy, comparative effectiveness, pragmatic and/or implementation research clinical trials. trials using innovative designs such as platform trials, adaptive, and bayesian designs are encouraged. these trials may include ones that test different therapeutic, behavioral, and/or prevention strategies. trials for which this foa applies must be relevant to the research mission of the nhlbi and meet the nih definition of a clinical trial (see not-od-15-015). for additional information about the mission, strategic vision, and research priorities of the nhlbi, applicants are encouraged to consult the nhlbi website.this foa will utilize a milestone-driven cooperative agreement mechanism of award and runs in parallel with a companion foa par-22-192() that encourages applications for a collaborating clinical coordinating center (ccc). the objective of the dcc application is to present a comprehensive plan to provide overall project coordination, administration, data management, and biostatistical support for the clinical trial proposed in the collaborating ccc application. the application should also describe its approaches to collaborate with the ccc on implementation of the clinical trial community engagement and diversity plans.both a dcc application and a collaborating ccc application must be submitted on the same application due date for consideration by nhlbi. applicants are strongly encouraged to contact the appropriate scientific/research contact prior to submitting an application.30 days prior to the application due dateall applications are due by 5:00 pm local time of applicant organization.applicants are encouraged to apply early to allow adequate time to make any corrections to errors found in the application during the submission process by the due date.not applicableit is critical that applicants follow the instructions in the research (r) instructions in the sf424 (r&r) application guide, except where instructed to do otherwise (in this foa or in a notice from nih guide for grants and contracts).conformance to all requirements (both in the application guide and the foa) is required and strictly enforced. applicants must read and follow all application instructions in the application guide as well as any program-specific instructions noted in section iv. when the program-specific instructions deviate from those in the application guide, follow the program-specific instructions.applications that do not comply with these instructions may be delayed or not accepted for review.there are several options available to submit your application through grants.gov to nih and department of health and human services partners. you must use one of these submission options to access the application forms for this opportunity.research objectivesthis foa supports applications to develop and implement a data coordinating center (dcc) for investigator-initiated multi-site clinical trials submitted to the collaborating clinical coordinating center foa (par-22-192). clinical trials supported by this foa include phase ii and above clinical trials that will enroll participants from two or more recruitment sites. applications that propose to leverage resources and infrastructure of active clinical trial networks are also supported by this foa. this foa will utilize a cooperative agreement mechanism (u24) and will be milestone-driven and performance-based to achieve completion of the clinical trial on time and on budget. the dcc is integral to the proficient operation of a clinical trial. the dcc contributes critically to the study design, ensures appropriate adverse event monitoring and reporting, manages data, conducts statistical analyses, and helps with the dissemination of results. the data are often randomized and blinded and the dcc holds the key to the codes. thus, an independent dcc is a necessary component of any multi-site clinical trial in order to ensure data integrity. clinical trials require the recruitment of human participants, so it is of foremost importance that participant safety and inclusion of men, women, and individuals of all ages, including children and older adults from diverse backgrounds be considered. recruitment should include populations affected by health disparities, which include blacks/african americans, hispanics/latinos, american indians/alaska natives, asian americans, native hawaiians and other pacific islanders, socioeconomically disadvantaged populations, underserved rural populations, and sexual and gender minorities.proposed research may utilize a design anywhere along the continuum of efficacy, effectiveness, pragmatic and/or implementation research clinical trials. for this foa, pragmatic trials are considered those that test an intervention under the usual clinical conditions in which it will be applied, while efficacy trials do so under more idealized circumstances. implementation trials test strategies to adopt and integrate evidence-based health interventions and change practice patterns within specific settings. innovative trial designs such as adaptive designs will be considered. the trial design should be appropriate for the study question. trials for which this foa applies are expected to contribute to the evidence base for important health matters of relevance to the research mission of nhlbi, including approaches to increase diversity of participants in the research and reduce health inequities and disparities. for additional information about the mission, strategic vision, and research priorities of the nhlbi, applicants are encouraged to consult the nhlbi website.a key characteristic of this foa is completion of core milestones. a core milestone is defined as a scheduled event in the project timeline that signifies the completion of a major project stage or activity. milestones must be performance-based to achieve completion of the trial on time and on budget, and must be established to align with the bi-phasic mechanism of the ccc award. milestones must be established for both the first year (coinciding with the ug3 phase of the ccc award) and subsequent years (coinciding with the uh3 phase of the ccc award) of the project. these clinical trials are expected to be conducted with a high degree of efficiency, with streamlined administrative procedures wherever possible. applicants are strongly encouraged to employ project management principles as appropriate. applications that address contingency plans to proactively confront potential delays or disturbances in meeting the milestones are strongly encouraged.phases of awardthe first year of the dcc will correspond to the ug3 phase of the collaborative ccc application and is intended to support the development of case report forms and other resources necessary to the performance of the clinical trial; further development of study partnerships; finalization of the protocol; and subsequent approval of data and safety monitoring board; and single institutional review board (see not-od-16-094) approvals of the trial protocol; and informed consent(s)/assent(s); manual of operations; data management systems and randomization procedures; and finalized integrated project management plans.the second year of the dcc award is contingent on the successful completion of the ug3 phase of the collaborative ccc application, and corresponds to the first year of the uh3 phase of the ccc. the decision to proceed beyond the first year of the dcc award will be made after administrative reviews of the progress made by both the dcc and the ccc are conducted approximately 9 months into award (i.e., progress report will be due), with particular attention paid to the extent to which agreed-upon milestones have been met and are subject to the availability of funds. due to the collaborative and parallel nature of these foas, nhlbi will enter into negotiation with the dcc to achieve early phase-out of the award if ccc or dcc progress is deemed inadequate upon administrative review.for trials using an fda regulated product and requiring an ind or ide application to administer the product to humans, investigators must (1) secure ind authorization or ide approval and (2) provide documentation of this authorization or approval to nhlbi before a funding decision will be made. necessary drugs, devices, or other resources must be obtained by the end of the first year of the award to allow for the full execution of the proposed clinical trial. in addition, proposed clinical trials are expected to be able to begin enrollment by the end of the first year of the dcc award.milestones must address timing of overall recruitment/enrollment and retention goals, including accrual goals for women, minorities, and individuals of all ages including children and older adults. it is expected that, if funded, both the ccc and dcc will be responsible for milestone completion but that only one party, the ccc or the dcc, will be responsible for recording the completion of both ccc and dcc milestones through econnect, an nhlbi platform that facilitates transfer of electronic information to nhlbi.nhlbi policies regarding milestones and relevant clinical research/studies policies are described in the following: nhlbi accrual of human subjects (milestones) policy, nhlbi policy for inclusion of women and minorities in clinical research, nhlbi policy for data and safety monitoring of extramural clinical studies, nih single irb policy and nhlbi data sharing policy.note: this dcc foa runs in parallel with a companion foa (par-22-192) for a collaborating clinical coordinating center (ccc). both a dcc application and a collaborating ccc application must be submitted on the same due date for consideration by nhlbi. dcc applications submitted without a collaborative ccc (ug3/uh3) application will be deemed incomplete and will not proceed to review. applicants are encouraged to use the compendium of best practices for data coordinating centers as a reference tool.prior to submissionapplicants are strongly encouraged to consult with the scientific/research contacts for the area of science for which they are planning to develop an application prior to submission to confirm the nhlbi-specific clinical trial foa to which the application should be submitted. early contact (at least 12 weeks prior to submission) is encouraged. this period of time provides an opportunity for nhlbi staff to discuss the scope and goals, and to provide information and guidance to potential applicants. additionally, a staff consultation is required when direct costs (dcs) are $500,000 or higher (see nhlbi policy regarding direct costs of $500,000 or more).notice of nih's interest in diversityevery facet of the united states scientific research enterprise—from basic laboratory research to clinical and translational research to policy formation–requires superior intellect, creativity and a wide range of skill sets and viewpoints. nih’s ability to help ensure that the nation remains a global leader in scientific discovery and innovation is dependent upon a pool of highly talented scientists from diverse backgrounds who will help to further nih's mission. research shows that diverse teams working together and capitalizing on innovative ideas and distinct perspectives outperform homogenous teams. scientists and trainees from diverse backgrounds and life experiences bring different perspectives, creativity, and individual enterprise to address complex scientific problems. there are many benefits that flow from a diverse nih-supported scientific workforce, including: fostering scientific innovation, enhancing global competitiveness, contributing to robust learning environments, improving the quality of the research, advancing the likelihood that underserved or health disparity populations participate in, and benefit from health research, and enhancing public trust. in spite of tremendous advancements in scientific research, information, educational and research opportunities are not equally available to all. nih encourages institutions to diversify their student and faculty populations to enhance the participation of individuals from groups that are underrepresented in the biomedical, clinical, behavioral and social sciences. see not-od-20-031 and reminder: notice of nih's encouragement of applications supporting individuals from underrepresented ethnic and racial groups as well as individuals with disabilities, not-od-22-019 for details.see section viii. other information for award authorities and regulations.cooperative agreement: a support mechanism used when there will be substantial federal scientific or programmatic involvement. substantial involvement means that, after award, nih scientific or program staff will assist, guide, coordinate, or participate in project activities. see section vi.2 for additional information about the substantial involvement for this foa.the oer glossary and the sf424 (r&r) application guide provide details on these application types. only those application types listed here are allowed for this foa.required: only accepting applications that propose clinical trial(s).need help determining whether you are doing a clinical trial?the number of awards is contingent upon nih appropriations and the submission of a sufficient number of meritorious applications.application budgets are not limited but need to reflect the actual needs of the proposed project.the combined budgets of the ccc and dcc will be used to determine whether the policy regarding direct costs of $500,000 or more in any year will be applied.the scope of the proposed project should determine the requested project award period.the period of award is expected to be 5 years. up to 7 years may be requested if strongly justified.nih grants policies as described in the nih grants policy statement will apply to the applications submitted and awards made from this foa.1. eligible applicantshigher education institutionsthe following types of higher education institutions are always encouraged to apply for nih support as public or private institutions of higher education:nonprofits other than institutions of higher educationfor-profit organizationslocal governmentsfederal governmentothernon-domestic (non-u.s.) entities (foreign institutions) are eligible to apply.non-domestic (non-u.s.) components of u.s. organizations are eligible to apply.foreign components, as defined in the nih grants policy statement, are allowed.applicant organizationsapplicant organizations must complete and maintain the following registrations as described in the sf 424 (r&r) application guide to be eligible to apply for or receive an award. all registrations must be completed prior to the application being submitted. registration can take 6 weeks or more, so applicants should begin the registration process as soon as possible. the nih policy on late submission of grant applications states that failure to complete registrations in advance of a due date is not a valid reason for a late submission.program directors/principal investigators (pd(s)/pi(s))all pd(s)/pi(s) must have an era commons account. pd(s)/pi(s) should work with their organizational officials to either create a new account or to affiliate their existing account with the applicant organization in era commons. if the pd/pi is also the organizational signing official, they must have two distinct era commons accounts, one for each role. obtaining an era commons account can take up to 2 weeks.any individual(s) with the skills, knowledge, and resources necessary to carry out the proposed research as the program director(s)/principal investigator(s) (pd(s)/pi(s)) is invited to work with his/her organization to develop an application for support. individuals from underrepresented racial and ethnic groups as well as individuals with disabilities are always encouraged to apply for nih support. see, reminder: notice of nih's encouragement of applications supporting individuals from underrepresented ethnic and racial groups as well as individuals with disabilities, not-od-22-019.for institutions/organizations proposing multiple pds/pis, visit the multiple program director/principal investigator policy and submission details in the senior/key person profile (expanded) component of the sf424 (r&r) application guide.multiple pds/pis are allowed on any single application. because the foa already supports a team approach between groups of experts across sites and collaborating applications, the designation of multiple pds/pis on a single application may be less likely to apply. pd(s)/pi(s) from each linked application should not be designated as multiple pds/pis on each application of a collaborative set.esi applicants can be the pi/pd of an application providing they can show support of investigators with appropriate clinical trial data coordinating experience (as part of a multiple pi team). esis are encouraged to be part of the study team and they should be budgeted for support at a level appropriate for the role on the project.2.

council review, and earliest start date.information regarding the disposition of applications is available in the nih grants policy statement.1. award noticesif the application is under consideration for funding, nih will request "just-in-time" information from the applicant as described in the nih grants policy statement.a formal notification in the form of a notice of award (noa) will be provided to the applicant organization for successful applications. the noa signed by the grants management officer is the authorizing document and will be sent via email to the recipient's business official.recipients must comply with any funding restrictions described in section iv.5. funding restrictions. selection of an application for award is not an authorization to begin performance. any costs incurred before receipt of the noa are at the recipient's risk. these costs may be reimbursed only to the extent considered allowable pre-award costs.any application awarded in response to this foa will be subject to terms and conditions found on the award conditions and information for nih grants website. this includes any recent legislation and policy applicable to awards that is highlighted on this website.individual awards are based on the application submitted to, and as approved by, the nih and are subject to the ic-specific terms and conditions identified in the noa.clinicaltrials.gov: if an award provides for one or more clinical trials. by law (title viii, section 801 of public law 110-85), the "responsible party" must register and submit results information for certain “applicable clinical trials” on the clinicaltrials.gov protocol registration and results system information website (https://register.clinicaltrials.gov). nih expects registration and results reporting of all trials whether required under the law or not. for more information, see https://grants.nih.gov/policy/clinical-trials/reporting/index.htminstitutional review board or independent ethics committee approval: recipient institutions must ensure that all protocols are reviewed by their irb or iec. to help ensure the safety of participants enrolled in nih-funded studies, the recipient must provide nih copies of documents related to all major changes in the status of ongoing protocols.data and safety monitoring requirements: the nih policy for data and safety monitoring requires oversight and monitoring of all nih-conducted or -supported human biomedical and behavioral intervention studies (clinical trials) to ensure the safety of participants and the validity and integrity of the data. further information concerning these requirements is found at http://grants.nih.gov/grants/policy/hs/data_safety.htm and in the application instructions (sf424 (r&r) and phs 398).investigational new drug or investigational device exemption requirements: consistent with federal regulations, clinical research projects involving the use of investigational therapeutics, vaccines, or other medical interventions (including licensed products and devices for a purpose other than that for which they were licensed) in humans under a research protocol must be performed under a food and drug administration (fda) investigational new drug (ind) or investigational device exemption (ide).2. administrative and national policy requirementsall nih grant and cooperative agreement awards include the nih grants policy statement as part of the noa. for these terms of award, see the nih grants policy statement part ii: terms and conditions of nih grant awards, subpart a: general and part ii: terms and conditions of nih grant awards, subpart b: terms and conditions for specific types of grants, recipients, and activities, including of note, but not limited to:if a recipient is successful and receives a notice of award, in accepting the award, the recipient agrees that any activities under the award are subject to all provisions currently in effect or implemented during the period of the award, other department regulations and policies in effect at the time of the award, and applicable statutory provisions.should the applicant organization successfully compete for an award, recipients of federal financial assistance (ffa) from hhs must administer their programs in compliance with federal civil rights laws that prohibit discrimination on the basis of race, color, national origin, disability, age and, in some circumstances, religion, conscience, and sex (including gender identity , sexual orientation, and pregnancy). this includes ensuring programs are accessible to persons with limited english proficiency and persons with disabilities. the hhs office for civil rights provides guidance on complying with civil rights laws enforced by hhs. please see https://www.hhs.gov/civil-rights/for-providers/provider-obligations/index.html and https://www.hhs.gov/civil-rights/for-individuals/nondiscrimination/index.htmlhhs recognizes that research projects are often limited in scope for many reasons that are nondiscriminatory, such as the principal investigator’s scientific interest, funding limitations, recruitment requirements, and other considerations. thus, criteria in research protocols that target or exclude certain populations are warranted where nondiscriminatory justifications establish that such criteria are appropriate with respect to the health or safety of the subjects, the scientific study design, or the purpose of the research. for additional guidance regarding how the provisions apply to nih grant programs, please contact the scientific/research contact that is identified in section vii under agency contacts of this foa.please contact the hhs office for civil rights for more information about obligations and prohibitions under federal civil rights laws at

defense authorization act of fiscal year 2009 (public law 110-417), nih awards will be subject to the federal awardee performance and integrity information system (fapiis) requirements. fapiis requires federal award making officials to review and consider information about an applicant in the designated integrity and performance system (currently fapiis) prior to making an award. an applicant, at its option, may review information in the designated integrity and performance systems accessible through fapiis and comment on any information about itself that a federal agency previously entered and is currently in fapiis. the federal awarding agency will consider any comments by the applicant, in addition to other information in fapiis, in making a judgement about the applicant’s integrity, business ethics, and record of performance under federal awards when completing the review of risk posed by applicants as described in 45 cfr part 75.205 and 2 cfr part 200.206 “federal awarding agency review of risk posed by applicants.” this provision will apply to all nih grants and cooperative agreements except fellowships.the following special terms of award are in addition to, and not in lieu of, otherwise applicable omb administrative guidelines, hhs grant administration regulations at 45 cfr part 75, 2 cfr part 200, and other hhs, and nih grant administration policies.the administrative and funding instrument used for this program will be the cooperative agreement, an “assistance” mechanism (rather than an “acquisition” mechanism), in which substantial nih programmatic involvement with the awardees is anticipated during the performance of the activities. under the cooperative agreement, the nih purpose is to support and stimulate the recipients’ activities by involvement in and otherwise working jointly with the award recipients in a partnership role; it is not to assume direction, prime responsibility, or a dominant role in the activities. consistent with this concept, the dominant role and prime responsibility resides with the awardees for the project as a whole, although specific tasks and activities may be shared among the awardees and the nih as defined below.the pd(s)/pi(s) will have primary responsibility for:the awardee pd/pi will have primary and lead responsibilities for the project as a whole, including research design and protocol development, participant recruitment and follow-up, data collection, quality control, interim data and safety monitoring, final data analysis and interpretation, preparation of publications, as well as collaborations with other awardees.upon completion of the project, awardees are expected to put their data into the public domain and/or make them available to other investigators, according to the approved plan for making data and materials available to the scientific community (see section 3 below "collaborative responsibilities"). third party support of the proposed research activity (if proposed, accepted and approved) will be incorporated as a special award condition in the noa. awardees will be responsible for ensuring third party compliance and if the 3rd party support is no longer available, and not replaceable in a timely fashion negotiated phase-out of the award may occur. cost share is not a requirement for this program; however, if cost share is proposed, peer reviewed and accepted by nhlbi it will become a special award condition in the noa.awardees will retain custody of and have primary rights to the data and software developed under these awards, subject to government rights of access consistent with current dhhs, phs, and nih policies.nih staff have substantial programmatic involvement that is above and beyond the normal stewardship role in awards, as described below:the nhlbi project scientist will assist with development of research protocols, monitor patient recruitment and study progress, ensure disclosure of conflicts of interest, and ensure adherence to nhlbi policies.the nhlbi project scientist will serve on the steering committee and other study committees, when appropriate, as a non-voting member. the nhlbi project scientist may work with awardees on issues coming before the steering committee such as recruitment, protocol development, follow-up, quality control, adherence to protocol, possible changes to the protocol, interim data and safety monitoring, final data analysis and interpretation, preparation of publications, and development of solutions to major problems such as insufficient participant enrollment.in addition to the project scientist, a separate nhlbi program official will be responsible for the normal program stewardship of the cooperative agreement, and will be in the notice of award. however, nhlbi may elect to have a dual-role approach where a single individual may act as both the nhlbi project scientist and program official. final decision-making authority on matters of budgetary and funding actions, grants management actions, and management of intellectual property issues is assigned to nhlbi staff other than the project scientist. the responsibility for final decision making may reside with senior institute management, separate organizational components and/or oversight committees. because it is anticipated that the program official will participate in activities that rise to a level of involvement (i.e., additional role as project scientist) that results in conflicts of interest, for example, co-publication, other staff members such as direct line supervisors and/or other senior nhlbi program management staff will serve as agency program officials and will be responsible for the normal scientific and programmatic stewardship of the award.the nhlbi policy on authorship and manuscript review of nhlbi sponsored extramural research protects against conflicts of interest with the program officer.an independent data and safety monitoring board (dsmb) will be established to oversee participant safety in the clinical trial and provide overall monitoring of interim data and safety issues. as part of the collaborative activities under this cooperative agreement, the nhlbi will collaborate with the awardees to appoint and/or agree upon a single dsmb for monitoring the clinical trial. the dsmb may be appointed by the nhlbi, or with the approval of nhlbi, the dsmb could be an institutional dsmb. at the first meeting in the ug3 phase of the collaborative ccc, the dsmb will review the awardee’s protocol and potentially recommend modifications. subsequently, the dsmb will monitor and review recruitment, adverse events, data quality, outcome data, and overall awardee performance. the dsmb has the responsibility to review interim data and final data, and recommend whether the protocol should be modified, and, at each meeting, whether the study should be continued or should be terminated early. an nhlbi scientist other than the nhlbi program official or project scientist will serve as executive secretary to the board. because the dsmb serves as an independent group advisory to the nhlbi, study investigators shall not communicate with dsmb members regarding study issues, except as authorized by the board's executive secretary.the nhlbi reserves the right to phase-out or curtail the study (or an individual award) in the event of (a) failure to develop or implement a mutually agreeable protocol, (b) substantial shortfall in subject recruitment milestones, core milestones mutually agreed upon by the recipient organization and pd/pi and the nhlbi, consortium participation and collaboration with other awardees, (c) substantive changes in the agreed-upon methodologies and tools with which nih cannot concur, (d) human subject ethical issues that may dictate a premature termination, or (e) results that substantially diminish the scientific value of study continuation.areas of joint responsibility include:the authorized organizational representative (aor) is responsible for communicating progress on achievement of each milestone for the collaborative project to the nhlbi grants and program officers listed on the notice of award. award continuation, even during the period recommended for support, is conditional upon satisfactory progress. if, at any time, recruitment, as defined in the nhlbi accrual of human subjects (milestones) policy, falls significantly below projections, or core milestones mutually agreed upon by the recipient organization and pd/pi and the nhlbi are not met, the nhlbi may consider ending support and negotiating an orderly phase-out of the award. nhlbi grants management and program officers will closely monitor progress at all trial stages including milestones, accrual, and safety.awardees will retain custody of and have primary rights to their data developed under these awards, subject to government rights of access consistent with current hhs, phs, and nih policies. the principal investigator of this award will be required to participate in periodic meetings and telephone conference calls with other investigators performing large-scale genome wide association studies supported by the nhlbi. these meetings and calls will be arranged by nhlbi staff to promote sharing of information among investigators regarding state of science technologies, data management techniques, analytical strategies and tools, and data sharing. support or other involvement of industry or any other third party in the study (e.g., participation by the third party; involvement of study resources or citing the name of the study or nhlbi support; or special access to study results, data, findings or resources) may be advantageous and appropriate. however, except for licensing of patents or copyrights, support or involvement of any third party will occur only following notification of and concurrence by nhlbi.nhlbi will partner with the pd/pi to ensure that the dataset preparation is congruent with requirements for nhlbi data repository datasets and associated documentation for submission to the biological specimen and data repository information coordinating center (biolincc) and the nhlbi policy for data sharing from clinical trials and epidemiological studies, and is in accordance with the guidelines for nhlbi data set preparation.study investigators are strongly encouraged to publish and to release publicly and disseminate results, tools, resources and other products of the study, in accordance with the study protocols and governance. it is expected that all methods, analyses, software, and algorithms will be made available in a timely matter to the scientific community. a plan for dissemination of study results will be developed by the awardee pd/pi in collaboration with the nih project scientist and incorporated as a special term and condition in the noa. within 3 years of the end of the period of nhlbi support for the project, data not previously released and other study materials or products not previously distributed are expected to be made available to individuals who are not study investigators in accordance with the nhlbi data sharing policy.dispute resolution:any disagreement that may arise in scientific or programmatic matters (within the scope of the award) between award recipients and the nih may be brought to dispute resolution. a dispute resolution panel composed will be convened. it will have three members: a designee selected by the executive committee (with the nhlbi member absent from the discussion) or by the individual awardee in the event of an individual disagreement, a second member selected by nih, and the third designee with expertise in the relevant area selected by the other two; in the case of individual disagreement, the first member may be chosen by the individual awardee. this special dispute resolution does not alter the awardees' right to appeal an adverse action that is otherwise appealable in accordance with phs regulations at 42 cfr part 50, subpart d and hhs regulation at 45 cfr part 16.multiple pd/pi dispute resolution if a conflict develops between pd(s)/pi(s) in a multiple pd/pi application, the following procedures will apply:the departmental administrators representing the pd(s)/pi(s) shall meet and attempt in good faith to settle any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to the interpretation, performance or breach of this disagreement. however, if the departmental administrators fail to reach resolution in 30 days then nih may invoke dispute resolution procedures as described in the above paragraph.data management and sharingnote: the nih policy for data management and sharing is effective for due dates on or after january 25, 2023.consistent with the nih policy for data management and sharing, when data management and sharing is applicable to the award, recipients will be required to adhere to the data management and sharing requirements as outlined in the nih grants policy statement. upon the approval of a data management and sharing plan, it is required for recipients to implement the plan as described.3. reportingwhen multiple years are involved, recipients will be required to submit the research performance progress report (rppr) annually and financial statements as required in the nih grants policy statement.a final rppr, invention statement, and the expenditure data portion of the federal financial report are required for closeout of an award, as described in the nih grants policy statement. nih foas outline intended research goals and objectives. post award, nih will review and measure performance based on the details and outcomes that are shared within the rppr, as described at 45 cfr part 75.301 and 2 cfr part 200.301.the federal funding accountability and transparency act of 2006 (transparency act), includes a requirement for recipients of federal grants to report information about first-tier subawards and executive compensation under federal assistance awards issued in fy2011 or later. all recipients of applicable nih grants and cooperative agreements are required to report to the federal subaward reporting system (fsrs) available at www.fsrs.gov on all subawards over $25,000. see the nih grants policy statement for additional information on this reporting requirement.in accordance with the regulatory requirements provided at 45 cfr 75.113 and appendix xii to 45 cfr part 75, recipients that have currently active federal grants, cooperative agreements, and procurement contracts from all federal awarding agencies with a cumulative total value greater than $10,000,000 for any period of time during the period of performance of a federal award, must report and maintain the currency of information reported in the system for award management (sam) about civil, criminal, and administrative proceedings in connection with the award or performance of a federal award that reached final disposition within the most recent five-year period. the recipient must also make semiannual disclosures regarding
