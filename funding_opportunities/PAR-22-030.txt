applicableit is critical that applicants follow the instructions in the research (r) instructions in the sf424 (r&r) application guide,except where instructed to do otherwise (in this foa or in a notice from nih guide for grants and contracts ).conformance to all requirements (both in the application guide and the foa) is required and strictly enforced. applicants must read and follow all application instructions in the application guide as well as any program-specific instructions noted in section iv. when the program-specific instructions deviate from those in the application guide, follow the program-specific instructions.applications that do not comply with these instructions may be delayed or not accepted for review.there are several options available to submit your application through grants.gov to nih and department of health and human services partners. you must use one of these submission options to access the application forms for this opportunity.this funding opportunity announcement (foa) is part of the ninds ultra-rare gene-based therapy (urgent) network. the mission of urgent is to support and facilitate the development of gene-based or transcript-directed therapeutic agents with compelling proof-of-concept (poc) data towards first-in-human (fih) clinical trials for individuals suffering from severely debilitating or life-threatening ultra-rare neurological diseases. specifically, this foa will support projects ready to complete investigational new drug (ind)-enabling studies and initiate clinical trial planning activities. successful projects ending with an ind cleared by fda will be eligible to apply for funding to conduct a fih clinical trial supported by urgent network resources.applicants must have identified and characterized a clinical therapeutic candidate as supported by robust poc data for the intended therapeutic approach and specific disease. the objective of this program is to support activities, such as ind-enabling safety/toxicology studies, pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic (pk/pd) studies, to support initial dosing in humans, development of a clinical protocol, clinical end-point assay development, assembly of a research ind application, and clinical trial planning and preparedness activities. this is a milestone-driven cooperative agreement program involving participation of nih program staff and external subject matter experts (smes) in the development of the project plan and monitoring of research progress.backgroundin the united states, a rare disease is defined as a condition that affects fewer than 200,000 people in the united states, based on the definition created by congress in the orphan drug act of 1983 and adopted by the fda. ultra-rare diseases affect substantially fewer people, less than or equal to 6,000; in the u.s., this equates to as few or fewer than one in 50,000 people. approximately 95% of rare diseases, including ultra-rare diseases, have no fda-approved therapeutic available and an estimated 80% of rare diseases have an identified genetic origin. these rare diseases are often due to pathogenic variants in a single gene that alter gene product function. many rare and ultra-rare diseases are caused by different pathogenic variants, some of which may be unique to a single individual or to a very small number of individuals. cumulatively, these diseases represent a large unmet medical need as there are few available effective treatments and limited commercial incentive for therapeutic development.the ninds ultra-rare gene-based therapy (urgent) network addresses challenges within ultra-rare disease communities by facilitating and supporting the development of tailored therapeutic interventions using established precision medicine platforms for the treatment of individuals diagnosed with a debilitating and often fatal, ultra-rare neurological and/or neuromuscular disease. due to the urgency of these individuals’ conditions, rapid intervention in the clinical course of disease is critical. therefore, the selection of a viable therapeutic approach will require the ability to customize the design, testing, and delivery of these interventions.urgent is poised to leverage nonclinical and manufacturing data from one project to another to enable the continuous reassessment of best development practices and clinical outcomes data. this would make a platform approach to therapeutic development more accessible to ultra-rare disease communities and applicable to a broader range of diseases. in addition, this approach aims to facilitate regulatory harmonization when possible and bring therapeutic interventions to individuals sooner.the design of early-phase clinical trials for gene-based or transcript-directed therapies for ultra-rare patient populations often differs from the design of clinical trials for other types of therapies and relies upon unique collaborations to be successful. successful completion of the funded project is expected to lead into a clinical trial, which will be supported by mechanisms targeted to urgent u01 award recipients through limited competition.research scopeurgent provides multiple pathways into the network for studies that propose to utilize urgent infrastructure and resources, culminating in submission of an ind package to the fda and preparation for a subsequent application to conduct a fih clinical trial. one path allows direct access to resources, par-22-028 ultra-rare gene-based therapy (urgent) network resource access (clinical trial not allowed)(x01), for applicants proposing to conduct planning activities and/or limited nonclinical development studies with a clinical candidate therapeutic to generate additional data (as needed) before a pre-investigational new drug (ind) meeting or submission of an ind application. another path into the network is described in this foa and seeks applications proposing to conduct formal ind-enabling activities and clinical trial planning activities.the program will support nonclinical ind-enabling development activities, such as cgmp manufacturing and safety/toxicology studies, of a clinical therapeutic that will lead to the assembly and submission of a research ind application and the initiation of clinical trial planning activities.since a single ultra-rare disease may be caused by many different pathogenic variants, some of which may be unique to a very small numbers of patients, the selection of a viable therapeutic approach will require the ability to customize the design, testing, and delivery of these interventions. the following gene-based or transcript-directed therapeutic modalities are potentially amenable to the development of precision therapeutic approaches:oligonucleotide-based approachesoligonucleotides offer the potential to treat many genetic diseases by either ameliorating splicing pathogenic variants, promoting exon skipping, or targeting dominantly acting transcripts. oligonucleotide-based interventions for neurological diseases include, but are not limited to antisense oligonucleotides (asos), small interfering rnas (sirna) or short hairpin rnas (shrna).viral vector-based approachesviral-based therapeutics (e.g., adeno-associated viruses (aavs)) and other potential vector and/or delivery vehicles, containing the correct gene construct, may be used as an in vivo therapeutic approach to replace or knockdown expression of a disease-causing gene. alternatively, cell therapies involving ex vivo gene targeting may offer another therapeutic approach.genome editing-based approachesseveral platform technologies such as zinc finger nucleases (zfns), transcription activator-like effector-based nucleases (talens) and clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (crispr)-crispr-associated protein systems have emerged as promising approaches to correct disease-causing pathogenic variants.other gene-based therapeutic approachessmall-molecule drugs that can selectively bind rna and modulate pre-mrna splicing have potential as a treatment strategy for human genetic diseases. therefore, these nucleic acid–targeted small molecules have therapeutic potential in the treatment of some ultra-rare neurological and neuromuscular diseases.structureapplications submitted in response to this foa will utilize a milestone-driven cooperative agreement (u01) mechanism to conduct nonclinical ind-enabling studies, file a research ind, and prepare for a clinical trial. applications are expected to address objectives for both the nonclinical and clinical trial preparedness milestones and are strongly encouraged to use project management principles as appropriate.the nonclinical and clinical trial planning milestones combined are generally expected to be completed within a total of 2 years.for each project provided access to the network, the ninds will assemble a customized multi-disciplinary project team (mpt). the mpt will include members of the program director/principal investigator’s (pd/pi) team and additional sme consultants. the mpt will establish an overall strategy for the project with milestones, including a plan and timeline, and will develop and coordinate activities across different urgent contract resources.leveraging ninds contract research resourcesurgent will provide successful applicants with access to therapeutic development resources and sme consultants. these ninds contract resources will assist investigators to rapidly advance patient-customized therapeutics through manufacturing, nonclinical toxicology testing, and evaluation in clinical studies. a list of current urgent resources can be found at http://www.ninds.nih.gov/current-research/research-funded-ninds/translational-research/urgent-network.entry requirementsapplicants that have rational poc data obtained through scientifically rigorous experimentation for a viable gene-based or transcript-directed therapeutic clinical candidate for a specified ultra-rare disease patient population that supports nonclinical and clinical development are encouraged to apply.this foa encourages applications proposing plans for nonclinical development in parallel with clinical planning activities, including, but not limited to:milestonesbecause therapeutics development is inherently high risk, it is expected that there may be attrition as projects progress. clear go/no-go milestones will be established by the mpt. the mpt will establish an overall strategy for the project with milestones, including a plan and timeline, to develop and coordinate activities across different urgent contract resources.these milestones will be based upon a template outline of achievements necessary to progress through therapeutic development but will be tailored to the specific therapeutic and its intended disease indication. successful continuation of projects will be contingent upon:clinical trial informationfor applications proposing a clinical trial, note the following definitions and restrictions for this funding announcement:applicants are strongly advised to consult with ninds scientific/research staff prior to submitting an application with human subjects to determine the appropriate funding opportunity.applications not responsive to this foa:nonresponsive applications include those that involve any of the following activities:nonresponsive applications will be administratively withdrawn prior to review.intellectual property rights and confidentialitythis program is structured so that the awardee institution retains their assignment of intellectual property (ip) rights and gains assignment of ip rights from the urgent contractors (and thereby control the patent prosecution and licensing negotiations) for candidate therapeutics developed in this network. it is expected that the awardee institution will take responsibility for patent filings and maintenance and licensing efforts toward eventual commercialization. the pd/pi is expected to work closely with technology transfer/business development officials at his or her institution to ensure that royalty agreements, patent filings, and all other necessary ip arrangements are completed in a timely manner and that commercialization plans are developed and updated over the course of the project. award recipients will be encouraged to identify and foster relationships with potential licensing and commercialization partners early in the drug development process, consistent with the goals of urgent.all smes will treat information as confidential and not disclose data or their assessments to third parties.consultationapplicants to this foa are strongly encouraged to consult with the scientific/research staff for the area of science for which they are planning to develop an application. early contact is encouraged as it provides an opportunity for ninds staff to discuss the scope, goals, and resources needed of the project and to provide guidance to applicants.see section viii. other information for award authorities and regulations.cooperative
