february 22, 2023pa-20-272 - administrative supplements to existing nih grants and cooperative agreements (parent admin supp clinical trial optional)national cancer institute (nci)the purpose of this notice is to encourage currently funded nci extramural investigators to apply for administrative supplements to support cancer-related policy research including empirical evaluation of policy or evaluation of policy implementation or dissemination methods.the goals of these administrative supplements on cancer-related health policy are to: 1) generate new or utilize secondary data that operationalize policies hypothesized to affect cancer control at the geographic, provider, patient, and/or temporal level; 2) examine the effects of existing policies and/or simulate the potential effects of new policies, with an emphasis on understanding health disparities by examining differential impacts on disadvantaged groups; 3) identify effective community-engaged strategies for dissemination or implementation of evidence to inform policymaking.policy plays a central role in shaping health and healthcare, including cancer prevention and control. for the purposes of this notice we are including formal public policies (e.g., legislation and regulations) at local, state, and federal levels of government, and private/organizational level policies and practice guidelines, such as those implemented by school districts, large organizations, worksites, health systems, and health insurance or managed care companies. the research enterprise has a vital role in generating evidence to enable evidence-based policymaking, and in evaluating the impact of various policies and their implementation on health-related outcomes.health policy research may employ a range of data, or methods and approaches. to understand how policies can advance or detract from health equity, health policy evidence should include data generated in diverse populations and communities, especially groups that have been economically or socially marginalized.for purposes of this nosi, we have identified two areas of focus.option 1: empirical analysis of associations between cancer-related health policies and outcomes.projects can propose to generate and analyze data on federal or state policies that impact cancer control including, but not limited to, broad legislation or regulations that impact eligibility for publicly subsidized health insurance, premium cost of private insurance, health insurance benefit design, provider reimbursement, cost sharing, or healthcare financing. outcomes of interest include, but are not limited to, cancer-related healthcare access, utilization, quality, total or out-of-pocket expenditure, financial hardship, quality of life, patient care experience, and survival.option 2: community-engaged dissemination or implementation (d&i) research.projects can leverage community partnerships (e.g., with cancer control coalitions, community-based organizations, state health departments, etc.) to advance the dissemination of scientific evidence to inform the development of policies that will positively impact health, to disseminate evidence on health policies known to be effective in promoting cancer control, or to study implementation of an evidence-based cancer control policy in a new context relevant to community needs.within these areas of cancer-related health policy, the specific research priorities may include, but are not limited to, the following:option 1: research priorities for empirical analysis include (but are not limited to):option 2: community-engaged d&i research priorities include (but are not limited to):applications for this initiative must be submitted using the following opportunity or its subsequent reissued equivalent.all instructions in the sf424 (r&r) application guide and pa-20-272 must be followed, with the following additions:eligibility and eligible individuals (program director/principal investigator)budgetpage limitsthese sections have the following page limits:administrative review and selectionthe following criteria will be applied for evaluation of the applications:please direct all inquiries to:scientific contacts: option 1amy j. davidoff, phd, msnational cancer institute (nci)telephone: 240-276-5474email: amy.davidoff@nih.govoption 2aubrey villalobos, drph, mednational cancer institute (nci)telephone: 240-276-5293email: aubrey.villalobos@nih.govfinancial/grants management contact:crystal wolfreynational cancer institute (nci)telephone: 240-276-6277email: crystal.wolfrey@mail.nih.govweekly toc for this announcement nih funding opportunities and noticesnote: for help accessing pdf, rtf, ms word, excel, powerpoint, audio or video files, see help downloading files.
