could also be part of prevention and implementation research above)(would prefer here if ok as this is the language i got from despr)recovery researchresearch related to:linkages between hiv/aids and drug use (should this have been mentioned earlier within the background section?)(i think hiv/aids is becoming less urgent as a driver of internaitonal research and so while it should be mentioned and included i think putting it into the background would give the sense that it is the overriding topic of interest. certaintly ok to move it if you feel differently)pa-20-183: nih research project grant (parent r01 clinical trial required)pa-20-185: nih research project grant (parent r01 clinical trial not allowed)pa-20-200: nih small research grant program (parent r03 clinical trial not allowed)pa-20-195: nih exploratory/developmental research grant program (parent r21 clinical trial not allowed)pa-20-272: administrative supplements to existing nih grants and cooperative agreements (parent admin supp clinical trial optional)application and submission informationthis notice applies to due dates on or after october 5, 2021 and subsequent receipt dates through september 8, 2024.submit applications for this initiative using one of the following funding opportunity announcements (foas) or any reissues of these announcement through the expiration date of this notice.all instructions in the sf424 (r&r) application guide and the funding opportunity announcement used for submission must be followed, with the following additions:applications nonresponsive to terms of this nosi will not be considered for the nosi initiative.steve gust, ph.d. national institute on drug abuse (nida) telephone: 301-402-1118 email: sgust@nida.nih.govweekly toc for this announcement nih funding opportunities and noticesnote: for help accessing pdf, rtf, ms word, excel, powerpoint, audio or video files, see help downloading files.
