notice number: not-ca-20-034key dates release date: march 18, 2020 first available due date: june 05, 2020 expiration date: september 09, 2023issued by national cancer institute (nci) national institute on alcohol abuse and alcoholism ( niaaa )purposethis notice highlights interest in receiving investigator-initiated grant applications addressing the effects of alcohol on human health across the cancer control continuum.alcohol is classified as a group 1 carcinogen by the international agency for research on cancer (iarc). worldwide, 5.5% of newly diagnosed cancer cases and 5.8% of cancer deaths are attributable to alcohol use, including 5.6% of cases and 4.0% of deaths in the united states (u.s.). epidemiological and biological research has established that alcohol consumption increases the risk of at least seven different cancers in humans, including mouth and oropharyngeal, laryngeal, esophageal, female breast, colorectal, stomach, and liver cancer. alcohol use is estimated to be the third largest contributing risk factor for cancer in women and the fourth largest for men in the u.s., following cigarette smoking, ultraviolet (uv) radiation exposure (men), and excess body weight.renewed global attention to these risks and a 2018 statement from the american society of clinical oncology support efforts to place alcohol as a behavioral risk factor into the cancer control research agenda. research is vital to addressing this major modifiable risk factor across the cancer control continuum, notably in studies focused on prevention, treatment, and survivorship. further research is also needed to clarify dose-response relationships between alcohol and cancer risk, especially at low alcohol doses, and to better understand genetic and epigenetic variation in alcohol-induced carcinogenesis.topics of particular interest include communication about and awareness of alcohol as a risk factor for cancer, research on the biological and behavioral mechanisms through which alcohol affects cancer risk, research on the interaction between alcohol use and other health risk behaviors relevant to cancer, alcohol consumption and outcomes in cancer patients and survivors, studies of alcohol-related policy and its influence on cancer and the cancer burden, and methodological research supporting better understanding links between alcohol and cancer. a preponderance of past research has focused on heavy drinkers and alcohol use disorder; this notice encourages research addressing light and moderate alcohol consumption, including studies of light and moderate drinkers with any other contributing risk factors, such as smoking and environmental exposures. addressing alcohol consumption is important given that the large proportion of light and moderate drinkers contribute substantially to the population burden of alcohol-related carcinogenesis, such as the development of breast and colorectal cancers in human.research encouraged through this notice includes, but is not limited to, studies that:application and submission informationthis notice applies to due dates on or after june 5, 2020, and subsequent receipt dates through september 8, 2023.submit applications for this initiative using one of the following funding opportunity announcements (foas) or any reissues of these announcement through the expiration date of this notice.activity codefoa titlefirst available due dater01pa-19-055 nih research project grant (parent r01 clinical trial allowed)june 5, 2020r01pa-19-056 nih research project grant (parent r01 clinical trial not allowed)june 5, 2020r01par-19-348 innovative approaches to studying cancer communication in the new media environment (r01- clinical trial optional)june 10, 2020r01pa-17-220 mechanisms of alcohol-associated cancers (r01)june 5, 2020r01pa-17-135 public policy effects on alcohol-, marijuana-, and other substance-related behaviors and outcomes (r01)june 5, 2020r21par-19-350 innovative approaches to studying cancer communication in the new media environment (r21- clinical mechanisms of alcohol-associated cancers (r21)trial optional)june 10, 2020r21pa-17-219 mechanisms of alcohol-associated cancers (r21)june 16, 2020r21pa-17-132 public policy effects on alcohol-, marijuana-, and other substance-related behaviors and outcomes (r21)june 16, 2020r21pa-19-053 nih exploratory/developmental research grant program (parent r21 clinical trial not allowed)june 16, 2020r03par-20-052 nci small grants program for cancer research for years 2020, 2021, and 2022 (nci omnibus r03 clinical trial optional)june 24, 2020all instructions in the sf424 (r&r) application guide and the funding opportunity announcement used for submission must be followed, with the following additions:although the nci and the niaaa are is not listed as a participating organization in all the foas listed above, applications for this initiative will be accepted.inquiriesplease direct all inquiries to:scientific/research contactstanya agurs-collins, ph.d., r.d. national cancer institute (nci) telephone: 240-276-6956 email: collinsta@nih.govdavid berrigan ph.d., m.p.h. national cancer institute (nci) telephone: 240-276-6752 email: berrigad@nih.govgary j. murray, ph.d. national institute on alcohol abuse and alcoholism (niaaa) (for biological studies) telephone: 301-443-9940 email: murrayg@mail.nih.govi-jen castle, ph.d. national institute on alcohol abuse and alcoholism (niaaa) (for prevention and epidemiological studies) telephone: 301-827-4406 email: i-jen.castle@nih.govpeer review contact(s)examine your era commons account for review assignment and contact information (information appears 2 weeks after the submission due date).financial/grants management contact(s)carol perrynational cancer institute (nci) telephone: 240-276-6282 email: perryc@mail.nih.govjudy fox national institute on alcohol abuse and alcoholism (niaaa) telephone: 301-443-4704 email: jfox@mail.nih.gov weekly toc for this announcement nih funding opportunities and noticesnote: for help accessing pdf, rtf, ms word, excel, powerpoint, audio or video files, see help downloading files.
