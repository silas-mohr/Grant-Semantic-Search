opportunity description section ii. award information section iii. eligibility information section iv. application and submission information section v. application review information section vi. award administration information section vii. agency contacts section viii. other informationthe overall goal of the nih ruth l. kirschstein national research service award (nrsa) program is to help ensure that a diverse pool of highly trained scientists is available in appropriate scientific disciplines to address the nation's biomedical, behavioral, and clinical research needs. in order to accomplish this goal, nrsa training programs are designed to train individuals to conduct research and to prepare for research careers. more information about nrsa programs may be found at the ruth l. kirschstein national research service award (nrsa) website.the nrsa program has been the primary means of supporting predoctoral and postdoctoral research training programs since enactment of the nrsa legislation in 1974. ninds institutional research training programs are intended to provide high-quality research training. programs may focus on basic, fundamental knowledge about the brain and nervous system, disease-related basic research, clinical research and/or translational research. ninds programs are expected to have active approaches for ensuring superior mentorship and programmatic oversight for each trainee, and formalized training that equips trainees with the technical (e.g., appropriate methods, technologies, and quantitative/computational approaches), operational (e.g., rigorous experimental design, analysis and interpretation of data) and professional (e.g. management, leadership, communication, and teamwork) skills required for careers in the neuroscience research workforce.the objective of the ninds institutional research training program is to support outstanding training with the breadth and depth to prepare advanced predoctoral and postdoctoral trainees to become successful scientists in a rapidly evolving research enterprise that is increasingly complex and multidisciplinary. neuroscience research requires investigators who can draw on knowledge and approaches from multiple disciplines and levels of analysis, and apply this broad knowledge in novel ways to yield new discoveries about the nervous system. moreover, impactful neuroscience research requires investigators with strong foundational skills in experimental design, statistical methodology and quantitative reasoning.summary of key points. it is expected that the programs supported under this funding opportunity announcement will provide:moreover, ninds t32 support should only be provided to trainees whose mentors proactively ensure that their trainees have the opportunity to lead and be first author on a significant project.the proposed institutional research training program may complement other ongoing research training and career development programs at the applicant institution, but the proposed program must be clearly distinct from related programs currently receiving federal support.ninds training programs should be designed to increase the depth and breadth of trainee expertise within a thematic area. programs should consist of an integrated set of activities that will both unify a cohort of trainees and expand their expertise beyond what would occur in the absence of the program. for ninds t32 training grants, a well-developed program 1) has a programmatic purpose and a scientific theme, 2) provides activities created to address that purpose that go beyond the standard activities (e.g. journal club, departmental seminars) associated with research career development and 3) has programmatic activities that bring together faculty and trainees with a broad spectrum of expertise, the integration of which has the potential to stimulate innovative ideas and solutions to scientific problems. the fundamental benefit of an institutional, t32-funded training program is to create a rich, theme-driven environment that stimulates innovation, drives trainee focus on the highest standards in scientific rigor, and provides multiple opportunities for practice in scientific communication. thus, in most cases, the creation of a t32-funded training program should benefit trainees who are not directly supported financially by the grant as well as those who are.programs should create novel and/or expanded research training experiences and activities; they are not intended to simply support trainees to conduct research. education in career skills (e.g. grant-writing, oral presentation) although a critical component of all programs, is not sufficient to constitute a t32-funded training program. moreover, the activities that constitute the program should be specifically designed to achieve the stated thematic purpose of the training program, and not simply be cobbled together from existing activities that the institution or department offers.training pds/pis are encouraged to develop institutional training programs that will expose trainees to a diversity of scientific approaches, systems for study and tools and technologies. the training provided should enhance the trainees’ ability to conceptualize and think through research problems with increasing independence. moreover, programs should foster a culture in which trainees draw from a broad knowledge obtained from both neuroscience and other disciplines to address their research questions.institutional research training grants must be used to support a program of full-time research training. within the full-time training period, research trainees who are also training as clinicians must devote their time to the proposed research training and must confine clinical duties to those that are an integral part of the research training goals. the program may not be used to support medical training leading to the md, dds, or other clinical, health-professional training. similarly, trainees may not accept nrsa support for clinical training that is part of residency training leading to clinical certification in a medical or dental specialty or subspecialty. it is permissible and encouraged, however, for clinicians to engage in nrsa-supported, full-time postdoctoral research training even when that experience is creditable toward certification by a clinical specialty or subspecialty board.short-term training is not allowed under this par.types of programsninds supports t32 programs that address basic, clinical, translational or a combination of approaches in any area of research across the ninds mission. all types of innovative programs are encouraged. programs that intend to educate trainees in translational research and the steps required for moving basic discoveries to clinical applications may apply to this foa or may wish to apply under a foa specifically developed to support translational training programs (see not-ns-18-077).thematically, programs may include, for example, those in which applicants identify sophisticated multidisciplinary approaches and/or combinations of expertise which, within the specified field, are likely to promote significant future breakthroughs. such programs will be marked by the cross-training of individuals, for example, in multiple technologies, or from different scientific backgrounds, to address specific areas of need in that field. training programs may also be developed around specific research or disease areas (note that programs do not need to address a disease or set of diseases; programs may focus on a basic research theme that will lead to a greater understanding of neuroscientific processes). regardless of the thematic area, all programs should provide a breadth and depth of training to enable trainees to make novel discoveries and apply knowledge from other disciplines to their research.programs may support predoctoral students, phd postdoctoral fellows, fellowship-stage clinicians, or any combination of trainees from these three groups. for institutions that also have mstp programs and intend to support md/phd students with this funding opportunity, the pd/pi should ensure that the majority of trainees supported by the program are those seeking a phd rather than an md/phd.training grants that will support both predoctoral students and postdoctoral fellows should have a single program in which both groups of trainees participate and interact. the program may include shared and different activities, but they must occur in the context of an integrated program in which both predocs and postdocs benefit from the interaction, programmatic activities and collaborative possibilities that the program creates.programs that solely support clinician scientist training: programs that support clinician scientists exclusively will provide the research training, professional skills development and mentoring that are needed to prepare a cohort of fellowship-stage clinicians for success as physician-scientists. while support is intended to provide protected time for research and training needed to progress as a scientific researcher, as for all programs supported under this foa, there must be a coherent set of programmatic activities designed to address the unique training needs of clinician-researchers. whereas the fundamental goal for training clinician-scientists is to develop outstanding researchers who will have the background to pursue research questions with the knowledge that only a practicing clinician can have, all programs for clinicians should be designed to achieve the specific outcome of producing independent clinician-scientist researchers. thus, an important outcome metric by which t32 programs will be judged is whether the supported clinician obtains nih k award or other individual research funding.experimental design and statistical methodologyexperimental design: programs are expected to provide formal educational activities that reinforce the principles of rigorous experimental design to ensure that trainees understand the practices required for robust hypothesis testing and the application of these principles and practices to their individual research.statistical methodology: programs should ensure that each trainee is equipped with a solid understanding of statistical methodology relevant to neuroscience research. ideally, trainees will develop a depth and breadth of statistical understanding that will enable them to adapt and appropriately apply statistical approaches as their experimental repertoire changes. programs must ensure that all trainees have a solid understanding of the value and proper use of statistics, including an understanding of the many types of scientific failures that can occur due to inappropriate application of statistical tests. an introductory course in statistics is not sufficient to achieve these goals.statistical training and supportit is critical that trainees understand that statistical considerations are vital not only for analysis of data but for designing experiments and experimental approaches. to help trainees develop an understanding of the many contexts in which statistical considerations come into play, programs are strongly encouraged to incorporate the expertise of a statistician into the training program. funds may be requested for up to 1.2 person months effort to support a faculty-level statistician to play an integral role in the training program. ideally this support will provide the opportunity for all trainees participating in the program to consult with the statistician when considering experimental approaches, designing experiments, determining appropriate sample size for their studies, analyzing collected data, etc. it is envisioned that the supported statistician will contribute to educating the trainees on statistical issues in scientific inquiry, such as, for example, a rigorous understanding of p values, bayesian vs frequentist methods, the problems encountered with multiplicities, "p-hacking", the differences in acceptable statistical treatment of exploratory and hypothesis-testing studies, etc. finally, it is expected that the supported statistician will actively participate in the "program-wide meetings: experimental design, statistics and quantitative literacy" to lend strong statistical expertise to the discussions (see below for details).whereas the statistician may contribute to courses required for the program, funding will not be provided simply to support a statistician to teach a course. the intent of supporting dedicated effort by a statistician is to have the statistician be integrated into the training program, whereby, in addition to consulting on trainee research projects, they will participate in and contribute expertise to programmatic activities such as journal clubs, research presentations, seminars, etc.quantitative literacy and use of quantitative approachesquantitative literacy: ninds training programs should provide an appreciation of the benefits of quantitative approaches to experimentation (and the potential pitfalls associated with a lack of quantitative consideration of their scientific system). an important specific goal of these programs is to foster the incorporation of quantitative thinking into the trainees' research throughout their careers. the training activities provided by the program should equip trainees with the tools and knowledge required to examine their experimental systems quantitatively. the educational approach to quantitative literacy should be designed to produce a cohort of quantitatively astute neuroscientists prepared to be leaders in their area of research interest.quantitative tools and approaches: programs should provide experience in the use of practical tools for quantitative exploration, interpretation and evaluation of biological data relevant to the thematic area of the program. approaches may include, for example, the use of programming tools to model biological systems or events, problem-solving exercises that develop skills in quantitative exploration of biological data, and/or other didactic or hands-on activities that will enhance a trainee's ability to use quantitative approaches to answer scientific questions and guide the next steps in their research.funds may be requested to enhance and broaden the development of training in quantitative literacy and analytical skills. funds may be used, for example, to bring in outside experts to conduct seminars or workshops to enhance quantitative skills, literacy and fluency in the application of quantitative approaches to neuroscience research. to obtain additional funds for this purpose, programs must describe specific, well-conceived plans for enhancing training in these areas and the value that the additional funds will provide. for information on requesting funds, see "training budget" in section iv. for information on submission requirements, see "training in quantitative skills and literacy" in section iv.program-wide meetings: experimental design, statistics and quantitative literacyas part of all ninds training programs, it is expected that the trainees and program faculty will meet regularly as a group to discuss and evaluate the experimental and statistical approaches used in their own work and in literature relevant to the thematic area of the program. these regular meetings are anticipated to include, as relevant, discussions of the variety of quantitative tools and approaches used to examine different types of data, and potential approaches to modeling experimental systems.scientific rigortrainees should have a thorough understanding of the principles and practices of rigorous scientific research. programs are also strongly encouraged to provide education in human decision-making tendencies and cognitive biases, and how they can lead to erroneous interpretation of data (c.f. kahneman, d. 2011 thinking, fast and slow. new york. farrar, straus and giroux).professional skillsprograms should provide students with training in professional skills such as written and oral presentation for a wide variety of audiences. programs are strongly encouraged to include group activities such as elevator pitches, data blitzes and/or “shark tank” presentations, etc. not only are these helpful for honing organizational and presentation skills, but they help trainees to articulate the significance of their work to both lay (i.e. investors, advocacy groups and the general public) and scientifically literate audiences. further, programs should provide training in the skills necessary for grant applications, such as grant writing, understanding the grant submission and review process and understanding and responding to critiques.understanding career opportunitiesthe career outcomes of individuals supported by nrsa training programs will likely include both research-intensive careers in academia and industry, and research-related careers in various sectors, e.g., academic institutions, government agencies, for-profit businesses, and private foundations. trainees should have access to career development advising and exposure to a range of career opportunities. through these activities, trainees should become familiar with various potential career directions that make strong use of the knowledge and skills gained during research training and the steps required to transition successfully to the next stage of their chosen career.oversight of trainee mentoring and progressionin addition to outstanding scientific training, strong mentorship and career guidance are critical for advancement and success in science. consequently, ninds t32 programs are expected to have a formal oversight plan to ensure that trainees receive outstanding mentorship and progress through their training in a timely manner. the oversight process should ensure that trainees receive 1) appropriate professional guidance and projects with the potential to generate a publication record that will allow them to progress to subsequent research opportunities, 2) written and oral presentation skills that will facilitate their ability to publish their results as first author, submit competitive grant applications, speak at national meetings and interview for future positions, 3) an understanding of the research enterprise that will enable them to successfully navigate a research career and 4) an understanding of the many career opportunities available to them as scientists and what is required to compete for these different opportunities.enhancing workforce diversitythe research enterprise will be strongest when it involves individuals from a wide variety of backgrounds, who have a wide variety of perspectives. within the framework of the nrsa program’s longstanding commitment to excellence and the focus of programs in particular areas of research, t32-funded programs play a critical role in training individuals from groups that are underrepresented in biomedical sciences. training programs are expected to implement robust plans to enhance diversity and to promote inclusive research environments (i.e. institutional and departmental environments in which trainees from all backgrounds feel integrated into and supported by the biomedical community). whereas institutional efforts are critical to creation of inclusive environments, training programs must also strive to create environments that effectively promote diversity and inclusion.exposure to a diversity of role modelsto enhance diversity, it is essential that trainees have exposure and access to appropriate role models. this includes women, individuals from different backgrounds and with different perspectives, senior faculty who have the benefit of long experience, and junior faculty who have more recent experience in transitioning from training to independent positions. programs should actively strive to achieve diverse representation in program leadership, participating faculty and mentors, and invited speakers.annual ninds t32 program workshopninds will host an annual t32 program workshop (the ninds t32 workshop) that each trainee will be expected to attend at least once during their tenure on the training grant. at this workshop trainees will present their research in either an oral presentation or poster format, and engage in in-depth discussions of scientific topics, experimental design and quantitative literacy, issues related to translational research, and professional development topics (e.g. negotiation skills, writing a winning cover letter, conflict resolution). training grant t32 pds/pis will be expected to attend annually.training program evaluationit is expected that ninds t32 programs will arrange for regular internal and external evaluation to promote innovation and evolution, as well as to bring attention to deficiencies that those close to the program may not perceive.expectations for training program outcomestrainees should leave the t32 training program with the appropriate accomplishment and skills to move on to the next step on an independent research pathway. outcomes expected of training programs include strong trainee publications (including first author publications), and other accomplishments appropriate to their training.although a major goal of these training programs is to develop highly skilled and creative researchers, ninds understands that students and postdocs have many career choices. in any program, it would be expected that there will be some trainees who go on to do research, and there will likely be many who will go into research-related and non-research positions that make use of their training. however, outstanding scientific and professional training provided by ninds t32 training programs will be invaluable to both the trainee and the community, regardless of a trainee's career choice.note: this funding opportunity announcement (foa) does not allow appointed trainees to lead an independent clinical trial, but does allow them to obtain research experience in a clinical trial led by a mentor or co-mentor. nih strongly supports training towards a career in clinically relevant research and so gaining experience in clinical trials under the guidance of a mentor or co-mentor is encouraged.see section viii. other information for award authorities and regulations.grant: a support mechanism providing money, property, or both to an eligible entity to carry out an

applications.application budgets are not limited, but need to reflect the actual needs of the proposed project.grantees are expected to be familiar with and comply with applicable cost policies and the nrsa guidelines (nih grants policy statement - institutional research training grants). funds may be used only for those expenses that are directly related to and necessary for the research training and must be expended in conformance with omb cost principles, the nih grants policy statement, and the nrsa regulations, policies, guidelines, and conditions set forth in this document.up to 5 yearskirschstein-nrsa awards provide stipends as a subsistence allowance to help defray living expenses during the research training experience. nih will contribute to the combined cost of tuition and fees at the rate in place at the time of award. stipend levels, as well as funding amounts for tuition and fees and the institutional allowance are announced annually in the nih guide for grants and contracts, and are also posted on the ruth l. kirschstein national research service award (nrsa) webpage.$1,000 per year will be provided for each trainee to support travel to 1) scientific meetings and workshops that enhance the individual's research training experience ($500), and 2) the annual ninds workshop (the ninds t32 workshop) specifically designed for this training grant ($500).nih will provide funds to help defray other research training expenses, such as health insurance, staff salaries, consultant costs, equipment, research supplies, and faculty/staff travel directly related to the research training program. the most recent levels of training related expenses are announced annually in the nih guide for grants and contracts, and are also posted on the ruth l. kirschstein national research service award (nrsa) webpage.in addition to the standard nih allocation for training related expenses, applicants may request up to $8,000 to invite outside experts to conduct seminars or workshops to enhance quantitative skills and fluency in the application of quantitative approaches to neuroscience research.because attendance by the pd/pi, as well as trainees at the ninds t32 workshop is critical to student and postdoctoral training, dissemination of training practices and program evolution, pd/pis may request up to $700 to support their travel to this ninds workshop.applicants may request funds to support up to 1.2 person months effort per year for a faculty-level statistician to be incorporated into the training program to provide training and support to the trainees.indirect costs (also known as facilities & administrative [f&a] costs) are reimbursed at 8% of modified total direct costs (exclusive of tuition and fees, consortium costs in excess of $25,000, and expenditures for equipment), rather than on the basis of a negotiated rate agreement.nih grants policies as described in the nih grants policy statement will apply to the applications submitted and awards made from this foa.higher education institutionsthe following types of higher education institutions are always encouraged to apply for nih support as public or private institutions of higher education:nonprofits other than institutions of higher educationgovernmentsotherthe sponsoring institution must assure support for the proposed program. appropriate institutional commitment to the program includes the provision of adequate staff, facilities, and educational resources that can contribute to the planned program.non-domestic (non-u.s.) entities (foreign institutions) are not eligible to apply. non-domestic (non-u.s.) components of u.s. organizations are not eligible to apply.applicant organizationsapplicant organizations must complete and maintain the following registrations as described in the sf 424 (r&r) application guide to be eligible to apply for or receive an award. all registrations must be completed prior to the application being submitted. registration can take 6 weeks or more, so applicants should begin the registration process as soon as possible. the nih policy on late submission of grant applications states that failure to complete registrations in advance of a due date is not a valid reason for a late submission.program directors/principal investigators (pd(s)/pi(s))all pd(s)/pi(s) must have an era commons account. pd(s)/pi(s) should work with their organizational officials to either create a new account or to affiliate their existing account with the applicant organization in era commons. if the pd/pi is also the organizational signing official, they must have two distinct era commons accounts, one for each role. obtaining an era commons account can take up to 2 weeks.any individual(s) with the skills, knowledge, and resources necessary to carry out the proposed research training program as the training program director/principal investigator (training pd/pi) is invited to work with his/her organization to develop an application for support. individuals from underrepresented racial and ethnic groups as well as individuals with disabilities are always encouraged to apply for nih support. for institutions/organizations proposing multiple pds/pis, visit the multiple program director/principal investigator policy and submission details in the senior/key person profile (expanded) component of the sf 424 (r&r) application guide.the pd/pi should be an established investigator in the scientific area in which the application is targeted and capable of providing both administrative and scientific leadership to the development and implementation of the proposed program. the pd/pi will be responsible for the selection and appointment of trainees to the approved research training program, and for the overall direction, management, administration, and evaluation of the program. the pd/pi will be expected to monitor and assess the program and submit all documents and reports as required. the pd/pi has responsibility for the day to day administration of the program and is responsible for appointing members of the advisory committee (when applicable), using their recommendations to determine the appropriate allotment of funds.for programs that propose to have multiple pds/pis, at least one should be an established investigator in the scientific area in which the application is targeted and capable of providing both administrative and scientific leadership to the development and implementation of the proposed program. additional pds/pis may be included to achieve the training goals. any of the pds/pis may serve as the contact pd/pi. applicants are encouraged to clearly delineate the roles of the different pd/pis.in keeping with the effort to enhance the involvement of individuals from diverse backgrounds and perspectives in training, and in providing role models that bring diversity to a training environment, it is strongly encouraged that institutions include women and/or individuals from diverse backgrounds when forming the leadership team of the program.this foa does not require cost sharing as defined in the nih grants policy statement.applicant organizations may submit more than one application, provided that each application is programmatically distinct.the nih will not accept duplicate or highly overlapping applications under review at the same time. this means that the nih will not accept:the selected program faculty should be active researchers as demonstrated by recent publications and research support in the proposed research training program area. program faculty should also have a record of research training, including successful, former trainees who have established productive careers relevant to the ninds mission. when building a training team, programs should recruit faculty who are committed to training, mentoring, and providing supportive and inclusive research environments. additionally, consideration should be given to recruiting program faculty from diverse backgrounds (not-od-20-031), including those from underrepresented backgrounds, women, and individuals at different career stages (i.e. junior as well as senior faculty). it is the pd/pi's responsibility to ensure that every faculty member participating in the training program provides outstanding mentorship and guidance and agrees to fully participate in programmatic activities, as appropriate.whereas including outstanding junior faculty with limited training records as primary mentors is strongly encouraged, programs should ensure that there is a strong oversight mechanism, and potentially regular mentorship of junior faculty, so that each trainee, regardless of chosen mentor, receives outstanding mentorship and guidance.when choosing faculty to participate in ninds t32-funded training programs, pd/pis should ensure that each faculty member included in a mentorship role is committed to following the strictest principles of experimental design, appropriate statistical analysis, and scientific rigor, in their research.the individual to be trained must be a citizen or a noncitizen national of the united states or have been lawfully admitted for permanent residence at the time of appointment. additional details on citizenship, training period, and aggregate duration of support are available in the nih grants policy statement.all trainees are required to pursue their research training full time, normally defined as 40 hours per week, or as specified by the sponsoring institution in accordance with its own policies. appointments are normally made in 12-month increments, and no trainee may be appointed for less than 9 months during the initial period of appointment.predoctoral trainees must be enrolled in a program leading to a phd or in an equivalent research doctoral degree program.postdoctoral trainees must have received, as of the beginning date of the nrsa appointment, a ph.d., m.d., d.d.s., or comparable doctoral degree from an accredited domestic or foreign institution. comparable doctoral degrees include, but are not limited to, the following: d.m.d., dc, do, dvm., od, dpm, scd, engd, drph, dnsc, dpt, pharmd, nd (doctor of naturopathy), dsw, psyd, as well as a doctoral degree in nursing research. documentation by an authorized official of the degree-granting institution certifying all degree requirements have been met prior to the beginning date of the training appointment is acceptable. individuals in postgraduate clinical training, who wish to interrupt their studies for a year or more to engage in full-time research training before completing their formal training programs, are also eligible.the application forms

participation of, individuals from different backgrounds and different perspectives. the application should describe measures that are in place, or will be implemented, to ensure that trainees have access to a variety of role models and individuals with different perspectives.program faculty and mentoring oversightthe application must include information about the program faculty who will serve as preceptors/mentors and, if relevant, distinguish between faculty members who will serve as primary mentors and those who have other roles in the training program. it should expand on the information in the biosketches (see "participating faculty biosketches") to address the following:proposed trainingthe application should describe how the program will develop a diverse pool of outstanding neuroscientists who have the technical, operational and professional skills required to conduct research in an ethically responsible and rigorous manner, and to enter careers in the biomedical research workforce as delineated in the program objectives. the application should describe how the program will enhance the breadth and depth of training obtained by trainees, and more broadly, enhance the training environment.rationalethe application should explain the rationale and need for the proposed research training program, the relevant background history and the research training activities of the participating department(s) or unit(s). demonstrate the presence of a sufficient number of potential trainees in appropriate disciplines and program faculty with the appropriate scientific expertise, as well as the resources to achieve the training objectives. when applicable, describe the ways in which the training plan is distinct from other funded t32 programs at the same institution. for renewal applications, highlight how the training program has evolved in response to changes in relevant scientific and technical knowledge, educational practices, and to evaluation of the training program.program purpose and goalsprovide an overview of the proposed program. describe the programmatic theme and scientific area. outline the objectives of the program and the programmatic activities that will be used to meet these objectives. include information about planned courses, mentored research experiences and any structured activities designed to develop specific technical skills or other skills essential for the proposed research training. describe how the program will ensure that trainees are exposed to a diversity of scientific approaches, systems for study and tools and technologies relevant to neuroscience research. describe how the programmatic activities will unify a cohort of trainees and expand their expertise beyond what would occur in the absence of the program. for programs proposing to train a combination of predoctoral and postdoctoral trainees, describe the activities in which each group of trainees will participate, and how they will interact and benefit from the interaction, programmatic activities and collaborative possibilities that the program creates. for multi-disciplinary and/or multi-departmental programs, indicate how the individual disciplinary and/or departmental components of the program are integrated and coordinated and how they will relate to an individual trainee's experience.experimental design and statistical methodologyexperimental design: describe the formal programmatic activities designed to reinforce the principles of experimental design to ensure that trainees understand the practices required for robust hypothesis testing. describe the principles that will be covered and the format and timeframe for instruction. topics should include, but are not limited to, education in the design of well-controlled experiments; the difference between hypothesis-generating and hypothesis-testing experimentation, and the differences in design and analytical rigor required for each; scientifically appropriate determination of sample size; the appropriate use of statistics in experimental design and data analysis; and criteria for inclusion and exclusion of data for analysis. describe plans to expose trainees to the analytical approaches used in common experimental systems (e.g. electrophysiology, imaging, behavior, genetics etc.) such that they will be able to evaluate scientific data presented in the literature, seminars and other contexts. describe the program’s approach to ensuring that each trainee will develop a practical appreciation of these principles and their application to their individual research.statistical methodology: applications must include a detailed description of the plan for ensuring that each trainee is equipped with a thorough understanding of statistical methodology relevant to neuroscience research. describe how trainees will be educated in the different types of statistical tests appropriate for different experimental paradigms, the appropriate application of statistics in analyzing data, interpreting results and forming conclusions, and the practical application of statistics to data in their own experimental systems. describe the program's approach to instilling trainees with the depth and breadth of statistical understanding to enable them to adapt and appropriately apply statistical approaches as their experimental repertoire changes. while trainees may take, or have taken, an introductory statistics course, this is not sufficient to achieve the goals of this foa.statistical training and supportapplications should describe how statistical support will be provided to the trainees, and if funds are requested for incorporation of a faculty-level statistician into the program, a detailed description of the role, contribution and responsibilities of that individual with respect to the program. as stated above, the intent of providing salary for a statistician to be integrated into the program is for the statistician to included in regular meetings with trainees and training program faculty. whereas individual consultation between the statistician and trainees is highly desirable, that activity alone, or simply the teaching of a course, is insufficient justification for obtaining salary funds for a statistician.quantitative literacy and the use of quantitative approachesdescribe the formal programmatic activities designed to provide trainees with an understanding of the use and value of quantitative reasoning skills and approaches for application to neuroscience research. provide a specific plan designed to enhance trainees' quantitative literacy and to encourage them to adopt a quantitative mindset. describe the concepts that will be covered,

the thematic area of the program and to their own research. this plan might include programming skills for evaluating biological phenomena, systems and data, quantitative problem-solving exercises for understanding biological data and/or other didactic or hands-on activities designed to develop such skills. programs should describe how quantitative approaches will be integrated across the program's training activities.programs may wish to enhance and expand upon their current offerings for developing quantitative skills and literacy. funds may be available to bring in experts to conduct seminars, workshops or other activities to enhance training in this area. to be eligible for these funds, applications must include a detailed plan for the proposed activities.program-wide meetings: experimental design, statistics and quantitative literacydescribe plans for ensuring that trainees and program faculty meet regularly as a group to discuss and evaluate the experimental and statistical approaches used in their own work and in literature relevant to the thematic area of the program, and as relevant, discussions of the variety of quantitative tools and approaches used to examine different types of data, and potential approaches to modeling experimental systems. plans should include a description of the format and timeframe for these meetings.scientific rigordescribe the programmatic activities designed to ensure that trainees gain a thorough understanding of the principles of scientific rigor. describe the principles that will be covered and the format and timeframe for instruction. topics should include, but are not limited to, unbiased experimental approaches, methods, analyses, and data interpretation; transparent reporting of results; and acceptable and unacceptable approaches to image manipulation and figure preparation. education in the role of human decision-making tendencies and cognitive biases in data interpretation is strongly encouraged. additional topics may include proper data storage, data labelling, data organization and archiving, and when applicable, preparation of computer code for public sharing so that it can be interpreted by others in the scientific community.professional skillsdescribe the activities intended to provide trainees with outstanding oral and written presentation skills for both lay and scientifically literate audiences, and the typical frequency of public oral presentations by trainees. the ninds t32 workshop will be held annually and is expected to include opportunities for 5- to 10-minute talks and/or poster presentations by the trainees. describe any anticipated activities that will prepare trainees for effective presentations at this meeting in either format. describe policies and expectations related to trainee submission of individual funding applications (e.g. fellowships, foundation awards, etc.). describe required and optional programmatic activities intended to develop skills needed to apply successfully for individual fellowships or other types of grant support.understanding career opportunitiesdescribe the opportunities for trainees to learn about the many potential career paths available to them so that they may pursue a career of their choice that draws upon their ph.d. training. such opportunities may include, for example, access to formal career advising, internship/externships, or exposure to individuals with different kinds of jobs in the workforce. describe the oversight mechanism that will ensure that all trainees, in the context of meeting the program's expectations for research excellence and productivity, can pursue their desired career.training outcomesthe application should provide the information below about recent trainee outcomes through narrative descriptions and a summary of the data presented in the training tables. although the training tables for new applications only allow for five years of recent graduate outcomes, applicants may describe up to 15 years of outcomes in the narrative.describe the following:training program evaluationthe application should describe an evaluation process to determine the effectiveness of the program, and whether the scientific research climate is inclusive and supportive of trainee development. the overall evaluation plan should include the metrics to be evaluated (e.g. program activities completed, degree completion (if applicable), publications, fellowships/honors, subsequent positions, etc.) as well as plans to obtain feedback from current and former trainees to provide suggestions for program improvement. the evaluation should address not only the cumulative record of the program, but the individual training records of each participating mentor. describe plans to have the program evaluated by internal and external faculty.trainee candidatesthrough the narrative and summaries of the information presented in the training tables and the attachments, the following areas relevant to trainees should be addressed:for renewal applications, highlight how the training program has evolved in response to changes in relevant scientific and technical knowledge, educational practices, and to evaluation of the training program.institutional environment and commitment to the program.the application should describe how the level of
