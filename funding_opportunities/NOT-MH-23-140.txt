adult; older adult), geographic (rural/remote settings), cultural considerations, and health disparities influence the types of care that are provided. studies are encouraged that address the continuum of crisis service systems, as well as applications that address crisis services for children and under-resourced populations.backgroundthe national action alliance for suicide prevention's (action alliance) crisis services task force summarized needed crisis services for suicide prevention in their 2016 report, crisis now: transforming services is within our reach. the report describes effective crisis care as a systematic approach, optimized when delivered with the following characteristics: regional or statewide crisis call centers that use technology to support real-time coordination across a system of care; centrally deployed mobile crisis outreach and support on a 24/7 basis; and crisis services that can diagnose and provide short term stabilization. in addition to their therapeutic value for the individual in crisis, effective crisis systems that support individuals in suicide distress have been reported to be successful diversions from law enforcement by supporting emergency care that reduces avoidable hospital admissions, arrest, and incarceration.since not-mh-19-025, priority research opportunities on suicide prevention crisis services, was issued, evidence-based crisis services have become an even greater priority with the national suicide hotline designation act of 2020. the act designated "9-8-8" as the universal telephone number in the united states for the national suicide prevention and mental health and substance use crisis hotline system. the federal government has made significant investments to support the newly expanded crisis response services offered through 988, including investments to strengthen and expand the existing lifeline network operations, the crisis call center workforce, telephone/chat/text infrastructure, and mobile crisis response teams. substance abuse and mental health services administration (samhsa) funds 450 certified community behavioral health clinic (ccbhc) expansion grants that require crisis services be included in the array of services provided by grant recipients. cms has issued planning grants to 20 state medicaid agencies to provide qualifying community-based mobile crisis intervention services and also support expanded medicaid options to promote access to community-based mobile crisis intervention services. in fy23, samhsa will award $35 million in grants to better support 988 lifeline services in tribal communities.in anticipation of the increased demand for crisis services, samhsa published an online compendium, crisis services: meeting needs, saving lives that contains best practice toolkits and related papers that address crisis services, homelessness, technology advances, substance use, legal issues impacting crisis services, financing crisis care, diverse populations, children and adolescents, rural and frontier areas, and the role of law enforcement to help localities plan, build or improve their suicide prevention activities. in november 2020, the action alliance launched the mental health & suicide prevention national response to covid-19, which includes action steps to remedy long-standing needs for alternatives to criminal justice responses to mental and substance use crises. samhsa, in co-sponsorship with the national association of state mental health program directors (nasmhpd), worked with numerous partners to develop 988 implementation guidance playbooks for different audiences. these resources complement samhsa’s national guidelines for behavioral health crisis care and child and youth behavioral health crisis care as guides for best practices in the delivery of crisis services. as states and localities build, increase, and/or improve their existing crisis service systems, it will be critical to understand which approaches are most effective. across the continuum of crisis services, measurement-based care approaches to determine cost-effectiveness, quality, and outcomes of crisis services will be needed to demonstrate intervention effectiveness and identify areas for further improvement.depending on the research question, a variety of methodologically rigorous approaches may be indicated for proposed studies. these may include randomized controlled trials (rcts), natural experiments, quasi-experimental designs with non-randomized comparison groups (including propensity score matching and instrumental variables designs), time-series designs, difference-in-difference, stepped wedge, and other designs of equivalent rigor and relevance. considerations for selecting a research design for the proposed study include the scientific question that the study is designed to answer, practical constraints, ethical issues, and the tradeoff between maximizing internal and external validity; the design that is proposed should be justified, accordingly, in the application.specific areas of interesttopics of research interest span the crisis care continuum, including the effectiveness of call center strategies to address distress and coordinate care; approaches to deploy mobile crisis outreach and support; and approaches to diagnose and provide short-term stabilization. the varied nature of strategies deployed by states and territories to provide expanded crisis services creates opportunities to address research questions pertaining to policy approaches, as well. examples of responsive research include, but are not limited to the following:treatment and services interventionstriage, dispatch, and other forms of decision supportstrategies to promote service engagement/continuity, and quality of carepolicy researchthe nimh, nida, and orwh encourage research that addresses strategic priorities and is aligned with these recommended areas. for research on the effectiveness of interventions or services, nimh supports studies that employ an experimental therapeutics approach, whereby clinical trials are designed not only to test the intervention effects on outcomes of interest, but also to inform understanding of the intervention’s mechanisms of action. as such, applications to nimh that propose to develop and/or test the efficacy/ effectiveness of preventive, therapeutic, or services interventions must include specification of the intervention target(s)/mechanism(s) and assessment of intervention-induced changes in the presumed target mechanism(s) that are hypothesized to account for the intervention outcome. in the case of services interventions, targets/mechanisms might involve mutable consumer- or provider-behaviors, or organizational-/system-level factors that are intervened upon in order to improve access, continuity, quality, equity, and/or value of services. studies adapting existing preventive, therapeutic, or services interventions to specifically target customers in employment and training settings should provide a justification for the unique targets to be tested. research generating new information about factors causing/reducing disparities in outcomes is strongly encouraged as it may inform other intervention areas. see the support for clinical trials at nimh web page for additional information regarding dedicated funding opportunity announcements (foas) for nimh clinical trials research support.given the focus on scalable, sustainable approaches, nimh, nida, and orwh encourage interventions that can readily be integrated into community practice, that can be delivered using existing service platforms/ personnel/resources, and that incorporate features that are specifically designed to prevent threats to implementation fidelity. strategies that might be used to enhance sustained implementation and scalability include but are not limited to consumer-facing technology (e.g., self-administered content) and responder-facing technology (e.g., technology to provide responder support, training and sustained implementation with fidelity), mh or su specialty consultation via existing resources or other sustainable means (e.g., on the spot video consultation; telehealth, collaborative care approaches); or other robust design features that promote responder/provider competence and sustained implementation fidelity. to facilitate the translation into practice, this initiative is intended to support research that reflects a deployment-focused model of intervention and services design and testing that considers the perspective of key stakeholders (e.g., service users, crisis responders, providers, administrators, payers) and the characteristics of the settings (e.g., resources, including workforce capacity; existing clinical workflows) in the community settings where optimized prevention strategies are intended to be implemented.nih office of research on women's health (orwh)as part of the nih office of the director, orwh works in partnership with the 27 nih institutes and centers to ensure that women's health research is part of the nih scientific framework and supported throughout the biomedical enterprise. across the crisis services continuum, women face unique risk factors for exposure, barriers to reproductive and mental health care, and inadequate pathways for escaping victimization. global events such as the covid-19 pandemic, climate emergencies, and conflict-related displacements can magnify crises (e.g., gender-based violence) experienced by women and girls, with those already suffering health inequities being particularly vulnerable. with this in mind, orwh is interested in co-funding research identifying specific gaps within populations of women, studies proposing to directly address women's barriers to crisis services /care continuity, and those endeavoring to bolster the integration of research-informed strategies that address trauma as well as other contextually relevant, and gender-sensitive responses at each relevant level of influence within crisis service systems. projects focused on groups of women and girls who are understudied, underrepresented, and underreported in research, exploring sex and gender differences, considering intersectionality and multidimensional frameworks, and intervening across multiple levels in partnership with diverse stakeholders are highly encouraged. orwh is additionally interested in supporting research aiming to reduce mental health impacts for crisis hotline workers, many of whom are women. for additional guidance on areas of interest to the orwh, please refer to the 2019-2023 trans-nih strategic plan for the health of women on the orwh website (https://www.nih.gov/women/strategicplan) and the research on the health of women of understudied, underrepresented and underreported (u3) populations announcement (not-od-22-208).ic-specific application and submission information:applicants must select the ic and associated foa to use for submission of an application in response to the nosi. the selection must align with the ic requirements listed in order to be considered responsive to that foa. non-responsive applications will be withdrawn from consideration for this initiative.in addition, applicants using nih parent announcements (listed below) will be assigned to those ics on this nosi that have indicated those foas are acceptable and based on usual application-ic assignment practices.the national institute of mental health (nimh) accepts applications to the following or their subsequent reissued equivalents:the national institute on drug abuse (nida) accepts applications to the following or their subsequent reissued equivalents:application and submission informationthis notice applies to due dates on or after february 5, 2023 and subsequent receipt dates through may 8, 2025.submit applications for this initiative using one of the following funding opportunity announcements (foas) or any reissues of these announcement through the expiration date of this notice.the national institute of mental health (nimh) accepts applications to the following or their subsequent reissued equivalents:the national institute on drug abuse (nida) accepts applications to the following or their subsequent reissued equivalents:all instructions in the sf424 (r&r) application guide and the funding opportunity announcement used for submission must be followed, with the following additions:applications nonresponsive to terms of this nosi will not be considered for the nosi initiative.stephen o'connor, ph.d.national institute of mental health (nimh)telephone: 301-480-8366email: stephen.o'connor2@nih.govjulia zur, ph.d.national institute of ?drug abuse (nida)telephone: 301-?402-3869email: julia.zur@nih.govdamiya whitaker, psyd, maoffice of research on women’s health (orwh)telephone: 301-451-8206email contact damiya.whitaker@nih.govweekly toc for this announcement nih funding opportunities and noticesnote: for help accessing pdf, rtf, ms word, excel, powerpoint, audio or video files, see help downloading files.
