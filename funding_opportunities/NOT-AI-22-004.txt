(nci)the purpose of this notice of special interest (nosi) is to inform potential applicants to the national institutes of health (nih) of special interest in research on the etiology and pathogenesis of celiac disease, identification of therapeutic targets, and development of preventative or disease ameliorating therapies/strategies. backgroundceliac disease is an autoimmune disease that occurs in genetically susceptible individuals who develop an immune response to ingested gluten. this disease affects greater than 1% of the us population, and incidence appears to have been increasing over the last several decades. the only known treatment is life-long strict avoidance of all forms of wheat, rye, and barley. although a gluten-free diet is an effective treatment in many individuals, recent research has revealed that up to 50% of individuals following a gluten-free diet are inadvertently exposed to gluten, and a substantial minority develop persistent or recurrent symptoms.clinical manifestations are multifaceted and include gastrointestinal (ranging from severe malabsorption to subclinical damage of the gastrointestinal tract) as well as extraintestinal (e.g., skin) expressions of disease. additional manifestations may vary from subclinical damage of the gastrointestinal tract to refractory celiac disease that is non-responsive to a gluten-free diet. although rare, celiac disease is associated with increased risk of gastrointestinal tract cancers and lymphomas.the pathogenesis of celiac disease involves a combination of predisposing genes, gluten, and environmental factors. hla-dq2 and/or hla-dq8 haplotypes are the predominant predisposing genes, and dietary gluten is the major inciting factor in individuals with celiac disease. numerous other environmental factors influence the development of celiac disease but are less well defined than gluten. the reaction to gluten fragments occurs at the small intestinal epithelium, with both an innate and adaptive immune response. this results in characteristic autoantibodies, histologic changes (intraepithelial lymphocytosis and villous atrophy), and clinical symptoms (e.g., diarrhea or iron deficiency anemia).while much is understood about the mechanism of disease, unmet needs in understanding celiac disease pathogenesis remain, including limited understanding of pathways of disease and tissue destruction, and what causes the loss of tolerance to a component of food. on march 18-19, 2021, niaid and niddk co-sponsored a virtual workshop that brought together a diverse group of experts in celiac disease and related scientific areas to discuss research focused on celiac disease. the goal of the workshop was to identify research gaps, promote this research area to investigators outside of the field, seek avenues for training new/young investigators on approaches and methods common to the field, and understand the future needs for the most promising research.research objectivesthis nosi encourages, but is not limited to, research applications in the following areas:specific areas of research interest to niaidspecific areas of research interest to nccihthe national center for complementary and integrative health (nccih) will support research to investigate the mechanisms by which complementary and integrative health approaches prevent gastrointestinal tissue destruction, dysfunctions, autoimmunity, and celiac disease-associated non-gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., chronic fatigue, migraine, depression and attention-deficit disorder). complementary and integrative approaches may include natural products (i.e., botanicals, dietary supplements, prebiotics, probiotics, microbial therapeutics) or mind/brain-focused practices (i.e., meditation, hypnosis), body-based approaches (i.e., acupuncture, massage, spinal manipulation), meditative exercise (i.e., yoga, tai chi, qi gong), in isolation or in combination with gluten-free therapies. note: nccih only accepts mechanistic clinical trials (not-at-20-001) and will not accept a clinical trial that measures the efficacy or effectiveness of any intervention through these foas.specific areas of research interest to ncifor cancer or tumor-associated celiac disease, study questions may include, but are not limited to:specific areas of research interest to niamsthe national institute of arthritis and musculoskeletal and skin diseases (niams) mission is to support research into the causes, treatment, and prevention of arthritic, rheumatic, musculoskeletal, and skin diseases. in the context of this nosi, niams is interested in research related to the symptoms, co-morbidities, and complications of celiac disease focused in niams mission areas (including but not limited to skin conditions, osteoporosis/osteopenia, arthritis, joint inflammation) and the impact of pathways disrupted by celiac disease (e.g., tissue cross-talk, gut microbiome imbalance, etc.) in the development and progression of diseases within the niams mission.ic-specific application and submission information:applicants must select the ic and associated foa to use for submission of an application in response to the nosi. the selection must align with the ic requirements listed in order to be considered responsive to that foa. non-responsive applications will be withdrawn from consideration for this initiative. in addition, applicants using nih parent announcements (listed below) will be assigned to those ics on this nosi that have indicated those foas are acceptable and based on usual application-ic assignment practices.this notice applies to due dates on or after january 12, 2022 and subsequent receipt dates through january 7, 2025.submit applications for this initiative using one
