health (orwh)office of data science strategy (odss)sexual and gender minority research office (sgmro)tribal health research office (thro)the nih office of science policy (osp) within the office of the director (od) announces the availability of administrative supplements to support 1) research on bioethical issues to develop or support the development of an evidence base that may inform future policy directions, and/or 2) certain efforts to develop or augment bioethics research capacity. applicants may propose to supplement parent awards focused on bioethics or to address a component related to bioethics in a biomedical and/or health-related behavioral research study. note that applications must be within the general scope of the parent award.backgroundethical considerations are intrinsic to the conduct of biomedical and health-related behavioral research and the translation of scientific and technological advances into practice. research into bioethical issues can provide an evidentiary basis to guide conduct, content, and/or application of the biomedical and health-related behavioral sciences and their associated policies, which becomes of increasing importance as science and societal views continue to evolve. ethical questions and challenges are interlinked with many of nih’s general areas of scientific priority, such as responding to public health needs (e.g., covid-19, the opioid crisis, desire for precision medicine interventions) and emerging scientific opportunities (e.g., new data sharing infrastructure, innovative technologies). the investment in and the integration of bioethics-related research and policy demonstrate nih’s commitment to advancing the most ethical research possible, which, in turn, can facilitate public participation and trust in the research enterprise.specific areas of interestod is particularly interested in applications that identify, analyze, and/or address bioethical issues related to digital health and/or real-world data; participant engagement; return of research results for individuals, families, communities, and/or society; and data sharing. examples of such projects include, but are not limited
