research education program (r25) supports research educational activities that complement other formal training programs in the mission areas of the nih institutes and centers.the overarching goal of this r25 program is to support educational activities that complement and/or enhance the training of a workforce to meet the nation’s biomedical, behavioral and clinical research needs.to accomplish the stated over-arching goal, this foa will support creative educational activities with a primary focus on:purposethe nih investigation of co-occurring conditions across the lifespan to understand

universally recognized genetic syndromes. each year there are approximately 5300 babies born in the united states with down syndrome (ds). within the past 25 years, the average lifespan for a person with down syndrome has doubled, from 30 to 60 years. despite this increase in lifespan, individuals with down syndrome and their families face significant and changing health challenges with age, and they have often been excluded from participation in research that could improve their health outcomes and quality of life. while all people with down syndrome are connected by the common feature of a complete or partial copy of chromosome 21 (trisomy 21), there are significant physical and cognitive differences among them, indicating that inter-individual variability exists.down syndrome is associated with an increased prevalence of autism and epilepsy. about 75% of individuals experience cognitive decline in a syndrome that resembles alzheimer’s disease but has its onset a decade or two earlier than typical alzheimer’s disease. individuals with down syndrome also have high rates of hearing loss, eye abnormalities, congenital heart defects, sleep apnea, pulmonary hypertension, gastrointestinal malformations, thyroid disease, leukemia, and other autoimmune or immune dysregulation disorders including celiac disease. however, people with down syndrome infrequently develop solid tumors such as breast or prostate cancer, and despite multiple risk factors for coronary artery disease and high rates of obesity, sleep apnea, and type 1 diabetes, they rarely develop atherosclerosis or have myocardial infarctions. understanding this unique combination of risk and resiliencies will inform medical advances for individuals with down syndrome, and for individuals who do not have down syndrome but share these co-occurring conditions.this foa is one of several trans-nih research initiatives created in response to fiscal year 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, and 2022 omnibus appropriations reports, which encourage nih to expand its current efforts on down syndrome and common co-occurring conditions also seen in the general population, while increasing the pipeline of down syndrome investigators. together, the initiatives are called the include project (investigation of co-occurring conditions across the lifespan to understand down syndrome). information about projects that were funded in prior years, as well as the nih include down syndrome research plan, are available on the include project website at https://www.nih.gov/include-project/. the include project has three components:scopethis par addresses all components of the include project, with an emphasis on components 2 and 3 above. r25 projects are encouraged that address the field of ds research to improve the understanding of the biology of ds and support development of new treatments for health conditions experienced by those with ds.this funding opportunity announcement does not accept applications proposing clinical trial(s).in addition to expertise in down syndrome and its co-occurring conditions, ds clinical researchers require a broad array of knowledge and skills, including understanding of evolving research designs and methodology, biostatistics, computer science, etc. this type of training is necessary to thrive in a team science environment and is rarely provided through the traditional course of medical and graduate education. competitive applications in response to this foa will specifically address these gaps in clinical research training while aiming to strengthen and diversify the pipeline of promising new ds clinical researchers.depending on the stated goals of the proposed short course, course duration can vary from one week or less to a maximum of 12 weeks. course participants are limited to graduate/medical students, medical residents, postdoctoral scholars, and/or early-career faculty. nih expects all programs to engage in outreach activities designed to encourage participation of individuals from underrepresented groups in the biomedical sciences, such as racial and ethnic groups underrepresented in biomedical and behavioral research, individuals with disabilities, individuals from disadvantaged backgrounds, and women as described in the notice of nih's interest in diversity (not-od-20-031).applicants are strongly encouraged to contact include project program staff for current information about program priorities and policies before preparing an application. the include website has a list of contacts for each participating nih institute and center.applications are assigned to participating institutes and centers (ics) based on receipt and referral guidelines, and applications may be assigned to multiple participating ics with related research interests. applicants are encouraged to identify a participating ic that supports their area of research and contact scientific/research staff from relevant ics to inquire about their interest in supporting the proposed research project via the include website.projects that propose to recruit subjects with down syndrome are encouraged to promote enrollment of research subjects in the down syndrome patient registry supported by nih, ds-connect®. for other data and biospecimens collected from human genetic or non-genetic studies, awardees are encouraged to use biorepositories designated by include staff that meet requirements for broad sharing. an nih resource describing common data elements may be helpful during the planning phases of a project when considering ways to optimize data collection in order to facilitate broad data sharing. for those applications that generate clinical data, it is expected that the data sharing plan will include the include data coordinating center (dcc).research education programs may complement ongoing research training and education occurring at the applicant institution, but the proposed educational experiences must be distinct from those training and education programs currently receiving federal support. r25 programs may augment institutional research training programs (e.g., t32, t90) but cannot be used to replace or circumvent ruth l. kirschstein national research service award (nrsa) programs.see section viii. other information for award authorities and regulations.grant: a support mechanism providing money, property, or both to an eligible entity to carry out an approved project or activity.not allowed: only accepting applications that do not propose clinical trial(s).need help determining whether you are doing a clinical trial?the number of awards is contingent upon nih appropriations and the submission of a sufficient number of meritorious applications.application budgets may not exceed $400,000 in direct costs annually and are expected to reflect the actual needs of the proposed project.the scope of the proposed project should determine the project period. the maximum project period is 5 years.individuals designing, directing, and implementing the research education program may request salary and fringe benefits appropriate for the person months devoted to the program. salaries requested may not exceed the levels commensurate with the institution's policy for similar positions and may not exceed the congressionally mandated cap. (if mentoring interactions and other activities with participants are considered a regular part of an individual's academic duties, then any costs associated with the mentoring and other interactions with participants are not allowable costs from grant funds).participants may be compensated for participation in activities specifically required by the proposed research education program, if sufficiently justified. participant costs must be itemized in the proposed budget.allowable participant costs depend on the educational level/career status of the individuals to be selected to participate in the program.while generally not an allowable cost, with strong justification, participants in the research education program may receive per diem unless such costs are furnished as part of the registration fee. participants may also receive funds to defray partial tuition and other education-related expenses.expenses for foreign travel must be exceptionally well justified.individuals supported by nih training and career development mechanisms (k, t, or f awards) may receive, and indeed are encouraged to receive, educational experiences supported by an r25 program, as participants, but may not receive salary or stipend supplementation from a research education program.because the r25 program is not intended as a substitute for an nrsa institutional training program (e.g.,t32), costs to support full-time participants (supported for 40 hours/week for a continuous, 12-month period) are not allowable.consultant costs, equipment, supplies, travel for key persons, and other program-related expenses may be included in the proposed budget. these expenses must be justified as specifically required by the proposed program and must not duplicate items generally available at the applicant institution.indirect costs (also known as facilities & administrative [f&a] costs) are reimbursed at 8% of modified total direct costs (exclusive of tuition and fees, expenditures for equipment and consortium costs in excess of $25,000), rather than on the basis of a negotiated rate agreement.nih grants policies as described in the nih grants policy statement will apply to the applications submitted and awards made from this foa.1. eligible applicantshigher education institutionsthe following types of higher education institutions are always encouraged to apply for nih
