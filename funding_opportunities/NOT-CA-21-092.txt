nih research project grant (parent r01 clinical trial not allowed)national cancer institute (nci)this notice of special interest (nosi) seeks to highlight the interest of nci’s division of cancer control and population sciences to support investigation of the role of individual residential histories - a record of an individual’s places of residence over the life course - relative to cancer risk, etiology, prevention, treatment, and outcomes.backgroundthere is a growing recognition of the importance of residential histories in cancer research, as part of evolving cancer data ecosystem. residential history encapsulates a person’s multiple interactions with the social and physical environment that can result in lasting health impact. incorporating residential history records into cancer research can enhance our understanding of the variety of potential and actual exposures throughout person’s life that may lead to cancer and affect cancer outcomes, such as: neighborhood sociodemographic and physical conditions, poverty and social deprivation, accessibility to healthcare resources, quality and availability of cancer care, tobacco and alcohol consumption, food environments, contaminants in water, soil, and air. linkage of multiple cancer related data with individual residential history information offers an opportunity to add precision to the analysis of cancer risk and outcomes.one critical limitation in traditional exposure studies is the assumption that residential location of causative exposure is the location at diagnosis, while in reality, the causative exposure may have occurred at some previous address in the residential history. when past residences are ignored (mostly because they have been largely unavailable), exposures may be missed entirely or misclassified, and results biased against finding the association between exposure and disease.one of the principal reasons residential history has been largely ignored in epidemiological studies is that these data have been difficult and expensive to obtain. in the past, residential histories were obtained by interview with the subjects or close relatives. the recent increase in awareness of commercially available and other potential automated electronic sources of residential history data presents an opportunity to capitalize on the role of residential history in the context of cancer research and encourage the research community to generate new knowledge about the interactions between place and cancer over time.research objectivesthis nosi encourages studies focusing on two major themes: 1) methodology for assessment and improvement of residential history data quality, and 2) residential history data use in research in combination with other linked data sources to address environmental exposures and cancer risk, and additional cancer related information to address different areas across the cancer control continuum.studies may include, but are not limited to the following topics:additional information related to residential history research at nci, including the software for residential history address consolidation are available at https://gis.cancer.gov/research/residential-histories.htmlapplication and submission informationthis notice applies to due dates on or after october 5, 2021, and subsequent receipt dates through march 08, 2024.submit applications for this initiative using one of the following funding opportunity announcements (foas) or any reissues of these announcement through the expiration date of this notice.activity codefoa titlefirst available due datepar-21-190modular r01s in cancer control and population sciences (r01 clinical trial optional)october 08, 2021par-19-309stimulating innovations in behavioral intervention research for cancer prevention and control (r21 clinical trial optional)october 16, 2021pa-20-185nih research project grant (parent r01 clinical trial not allowed)october 5, 2021all instructions in the sf424 (r&r) application guide and the funding opportunity announcement used for submission must be followed, with the following additions:applications nonresponsive to terms of this nosi will not be considered for the nosi initiative.scientific/research contact(s)zaria tatalovich, ph.d. national cancer institute (nci) telephone: 240-276-6976 email: tatalovichzp@mail.nih.govpeer review contact(s)examine your era commons account for review assignment and contact information (information appears two weeks after the submission due date).financial/grants management contact(s)crystal wolfrey national cancer institute (nci) telephone: 240-276-6277 email: wolfreyc@mail.nih.govweekly toc for this announcement nih funding opportunities and noticesnote: for help accessing pdf, rtf, ms word, excel, powerpoint, audio or video files, see help downloading files.
