funding opportunity announcement (foa) is to encourage submissions of exploratory/developmental bioengineering research grant (ebrg) applications to demonstrate feasibility and potential utility of new capabilities or improvements in quality, speed, efficacy, operability, costs, and/or accessibility of solutions to problems in basic biomedical, pre-clinical, or clinical research, clinical care delivery, or accessibilitynot applicableall applications are due by 5:00 pm local time of applicant organization.applicants are encouraged to apply early to allow adequate time to make any corrections to errors found in the application during the submission process by the due date.not applicableit is critical that applicants follow the instructions in the research (r) instructions in the sf424 (r&r) application guide, except where instructed to do otherwise (in this foa or in a notice from nih guide for grants and contracts).conformance to all requirements (both in the application guide and the foa) is required and strictly enforced. applicants must read and follow all application instructions in the application guide as well as any program-specific instructions noted in section iv. when the program-specific instructions deviate from those in the application guide, follow the program-specific instructions.applications that do not comply with these instructions may be delayed or not accepted for review.there are several options available to submit your application through grants.gov to nih and department of health and human services partners. you must use one of these submission options to access the application forms for this opportunity.purposethe purpose of this engineering-oriented funding opportunity announcement (foa) is to encourage submissions of exploratory/developmental bioengineering research grant (ebrg) applications to demonstrate feasibility and potential utility of new capabilities or improvements in quality, speed, efficacy, operability, costs, and/or accessibility of solutions to problems in basic biomedical, pre-clinical, or clinical research, clinical care delivery, or accessibility. the rationale is to support first steps toward delivery of new capabilities to meet evolving requirements for technologies and methods relevant to the advance of research and/or medical care in pre-clinical, clinical and non-clinical settings, domestic or foreign, for conditions and diseases within the missions of participating nih institutes and centers.this foa utilizes the exploratory/developmental grant (r21) mechanism, which supports investigation of novel scientific ideas or new model systems, tools, or technologies that have the potential for significant impact on biomedical or biobehavioral research. an r21 grant application need not have extensive background material or preliminary information.this foa runs in parallel with another foa of identical scientific scope, par-22-091, which accepts applications that do or do not propose clinical trial(s).research objectivesproposed research to solve a wide range of relevant problems is sought, and may explore, but is not limited to a 1) new multidisciplinary approach to a biomedical challenge; 2) high- or low-risk development of significance; or 3) data collection to support future research with potential significance. an ebrg application may propose, but is not limited to hypothesis-driven, discovery-driven, developmental, or design-directed research. it may draw upon engineering, physical sciences, biological/medical sciences, mathematics, informatics, machine learning or any other relevant source of science or knowhow. to facilitate these objectives, modifications of standard review criteria are made to accommodate features specific to engineering-oriented applications.backgroundthe evolution and vitality of the biomedical sciences require a constant infusion of new ideas, techniques, and points of view. these may improve established technologies or may differ substantially from current thinking or practice. they may or may not yet be supported by substantial preliminary data. therefore, an ebrg may propose evaluation of an unproven approach for which there are minimal or no preliminary data.this foa encourages improvements to current art and/or new ideas that arise from applications of engineering's problem-solving approaches to model systems, tools, agents, targets, and technologies that would advance basic or applied biomedical research, clinical research, clinical care delivery, or accessibility.many major biomedical research problems are suitably addressed with a multidisciplinary approach that bridges the life and physical sciences. principles and techniques in allied quantitative sciences such as engineering, physics, mathematics, chemistry, computer sciences, and informatics, among others, have been applied to good effect in serving the multitude of nih missions. bioengineering approaches to problem-solving draw from diverse technical and scientific fields. multidisciplinary research results have provided improvements to existing capabilities, and contributed new basic and practical understanding, products, technologies, and methods that add knowledge and improve human health and quality of life.specific research objectivesthis foa seeks to encourage quantitative and physical scientists to work with biomedical researchers to catalyze the use of bioengineering approaches for their potential to open new areas of biomedical investigation.although engineering applications submitted to the ebrg and other related announcements are often perceived as risky, experience shows that engineering training to anticipate errors, analyze what can go wrong, and to use both established and new principles to fix these issues do serve to manage most risks. the ebrg, more so than related bioengineering announcements for mid-level and final developmental and translational stages, does have the risks of feasibility tests, early development, and gathering of preliminary data. program controls these acceptable risks by limiting total direct cost funds to $275,000 divided across two years. therefore, ebrg applicants are encouraged to explain the significance of the proposed work, why potential impact outweighs risks, anticipate difficulties and discuss possible workarounds. projects may include but are not limited to assessing the feasibility of a novel tool for clinical intervention, exploring new approaches to characterizing and modeling complex biological systems, improving and integrating existing technologies to provide a breakthrough in unsolved biomedical problems, or establishing preliminary evidence for a new, perhaps transformative bioengineering approach that challenges accepted paradigms.innovationinnovation in an engineering context is delivery of a new capability to end users. in the ebrg context of feasibility and early development steps, innovation is defined as a credible research strategy for successful early steps toward delivery of a new capability to end users.other/related engineering-oriented funding initiativesthis ebrg foa and its companion r21 foa (par-22-091), and the related engineering-oriented funding initiatives below cover the range of developments from early exploratory phases of new or improved ideas, through middle and advanced phase developments, to the translational stage aimed at delivery of new capabilities to end users:applications not responsive to this foaapplications that

organizational structure appropriate for the project?innovationdoes the application challenge and seek to shift current research or clinical practice paradigms by utilizing novel theoretical concepts, approaches or methodologies, instrumentation, or interventions? are the concepts, approaches or methodologies, instrumentation, or interventions novel to one field of research or novel in a broad sense? is a refinement, improvement, or new application of theoretical concepts, approaches or methodologies, instrumentation, or interventions proposed?specific to this foa: is it likely to complete an early step toward delivery of a capability that will be new to a high, intermediate, or low resource setting or in a well- moderately- or underserved population?approachare the overall strategy, methodology, and analyses well-reasoned and appropriate to accomplish the specific aims of the project? have the investigators included plans to address weaknesses in the rigor of prior research that serves as the key support for the proposed project? have the investigators presented strategies to ensure a robust and unbiased approach, as appropriate for the work proposed? are potential problems, alternative strategies, and benchmarks for success presented? if the project is in the early stages of development, will the strategy establish feasibility and will particularly risky aspects be managed? have the investigators presented adequate plans to address relevant biological variables, such as sex, for studies in vertebrate animals or human subjects?if the project involves human subjects and/or nih-defined clinical research, are the plans to address 1) the protection of human subjects from research risks, and 2) inclusion (or exclusion) of individuals on the basis of sex/gender, race, and ethnicity, as well as the inclusion or exclusion of individuals of all ages (including children and older adults), justified in terms of the scientific goals and research strategy proposed?specific to this foa: does the application propose a credible research strategy likely to demonstrate feasibility, accomplish early stage development, or procure preliminary data of promise for further, mid-level development? does the application present a coherent plan to test the feasibility and/or accomplish exploratory development suitable for establishing promise of a mitigation or solution to a problem in basic, applied, preclinical or clinical research, or clinical care delivery, or accessibility to care? are appropriate performance specifications described? for each stage of validation proposed, will the data acquisition support progression to the next stage of development?environmentwill the scientific environment in which the work will be done contribute to the probability of success? are the institutional support, equipment and other physical resources available to the investigators adequate for the project proposed? will the project benefit from unique features of the scientific environment, subject populations, or collaborative arrangements?specific to this foa: will the resources and environment suffice to achieve early stage progress toward long term project goals of solving or mitigating the targeted problem? are the governance and organizational structures likely to support a good outcome?additional review criteriaas applicable for the project proposed, reviewers will evaluate the following additional items while determining scientific and technical merit, and in providing an overall impact score, but will not give separate scores for these items.protections for human subjectsfor research that involves human subjects but does not involve one of the categories of research that are exempt under 45 cfr part 46, the committee will evaluate the justification for involvement of human subjects and the proposed protections from research risk relating to their participation according to the following five review criteria: 1) risk to subjects, 2) adequacy of protection against risks, 3) potential benefits to the subjects and others, 4) importance of the knowledge to be gained, and 5) data and safety monitoring
