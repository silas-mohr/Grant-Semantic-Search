iv. application and submission information section v. application review information section vi. award administration information section vii. agency contacts section viii. other informationpurposethis funding opportunity announcement (foa) solicits applications for grant funding to conduct large health services research demonstration and dissemination projects (r18) focused on combating antibiotic-resistant bacteria (carb) in the following ways: by promoting appropriate antibiotic use, reducing the transmission of resistant bacteria, and preventing healthcare-associated infections (hais) in the first place.backgroundantibiotic resistance (ar), which has been noted since soon after the discovery of penicillin, has become a national and international threat. the centers for disease control and prevention (cdc) estimates that more than 2.8 million antibiotic-resistant infections occur in the united states each year, and more than 35,000 people die as a result. in 2014, the white house called for a national effort for combating antibiotic-resistant bacteria (carb). the national action plan for combating antibiotic-resistant bacteria (carb nap) was released in march 2015, and in 2020, the carb nap was updated for 2020-2025 (available at: https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/carb-national-action-plan-2020-2025.pdf). the first and third goals of the carb nap are particularly relevant to ahrq's mission. the first goal of the carb nap focuses on slowing the emergence of resistant bacteria and preventing the spread of resistant infections, and the third goal of the plan includes improving the use of diagnostic tests in clinical care directed to potential resistant infections. the department has also published the national action plan to prevent healthcare-associated infections (hai nap), which is available at: http://www.hhs.gov/ash/initiatives/hai/actionplan/index.html. ahrq’s carb-related activities contribute significantly to achieving the goals of both the carb nap and the hai nap.a complementary foa (pa-22-047) highlights the research areas of interest for r01 applications related to carb.research objectivesahrq is interested in supporting ar research in all settings targeted in the carb nap and the hai nap, including acute care hospitals, long-term care, and ambulatory care settings, as well as transitions between care settings. ahrq notes that methods of combating ar and conducting antibiotic stewardship are less-well-developed in long-term care and ambulatory settings than in the inpatient hospital setting. additional research in these areas is especially needed. ahrq aims to support research in all three settings.it should be noted that ar blurs the distinction between community-acquired infections and hais since ar bacteria that emerge in the community tend to be transmitted in due time to healthcare settings. ar is not confined to specific healthcare settings. factors that contribute to ar in one setting affect others as well, whether through inappropriate use of antibiotics across settings or transmission of resistant infections from one setting to another.consistent with ahrq’s mission to improve the delivery of healthcare, ahrq will fund grants that address ar, in the following areas of research interest:promoting appropriate antibiotic use.areas of interest include but are not limited to:reducing the transmission of resistant organisms.areas of interest include but are not limited to:preventing hais in the first place.fundingthis foa announces the availability of funds to support large health services research demonstration and dissemination projects, using the r18 mechanism, that address the following aspects of the carb research areas noted above:a companion foa (pa-22-047) announces the availability of funds to support large research projects, using the r01 mechanism, in the following broad areas of carb research:in ahrq’s research funding framework, r01 projects on carb are intended to produce evidence to determine the effectiveness of interventions that are carb-related or to identify epidemiological factors, whereas r18 projects on carb are intended to take interventions that have been shown to be effective on a small scale or in a particular setting and to demonstrate and disseminate their application more widely or to explore issues of implementation and adoption.it should be noted that, in addition to the carb foas for r01 and r18 applications, ahrq has published a set of foas that solicit r01 and r18 applications focused on preventing hais. applications for proposed projects that are primarily focused on carb issues should be submitted in response to the carb foas. applications that are primarily focused on hai prevention should be submitted in response to the hai foas. it will be helpful for applicants to follow this guidance. however, because prevention of hais is intimately connected to achieving the aims of the carb nap, ahrq will consider applications on hai prevention and/or carb issues responsive if submitted to either set of foas.promoting equity is an important societal goal. ahrq intends that research funded by the agency contribute to this goal by addressing equity. ahrq encourages applicants responding to this foa to consider whether there are equity issues in their proposed projects and, where relevant, to address these issues in the proposed research plan.pursuant to its authorizing legislation, see 42 u.s.c. 299(c), ahrq conducts and supports research for ahrq priority populations (see section iv.7 for a list of priority populations). ahrq is interested in carb research that includes a focus on priority populations such that meaningful subgroup analysis can be conducted and results stratified by priority population can be produced.recipients of awards under this foa must provide annual and final reports of performance in achieving the foa objective to support large health services research demonstration and dissemination grants for combating antibiotic-resistant bacteria (see section vi.3. reporting).see section viii. other information for award authorities and regulations.section ii. award informationsection ii. award informationgrant: a support mechanism providing money, property, or both to an eligible entity to carry out an approved project or activity.application types allowednew renewal resubmissionthe oer glossary and the sf424 (r&r) application guide provide details on these application types. only those application types listed here are allowed for this foa.optional.need help determining whether you are doing a clinical trial?the number of awards is contingent upon the availability of funds and the submission of a sufficient number of meritorious applications.future year funding is contingent upon the availability of funds for each year of support.the total costs (direct and indirect) for each project awarded under this foa will not exceed $500,000 in any given year and $2.5 million for the entire project period. funds may be used only for those expenses that are directly related to and necessary to the project and must be expended in compliance with the applicable uniform administrative requirements, cost principles, and audit requirements for hhs awards (45 cfr part 75) and the hhs grants policy statement.the project period may not exceed 5 years.these projects are being funded pursuant to 42 u.s.c. 299a, which provides that ahrq shall conduct and support research, support demonstration projects, and disseminate information on health care and on systems for the delivery of such care, including activities with respect to the quality, effectiveness, efficiency, appropriateness, and value of health care services.all applications submitted and ahrq grants made in response to this foa are subject to 45 cfr part 75 (uniform administrative requirements, cost principles and audit requirements for hhs awards; https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?node=pt45.1.75), the hhs grants policy statement (see https://www.ahrq.gov/funding/policies/hhspolicy/index.html), and the terms and conditions set forth in the notice of award.higher education institutionsthe following types of higher education institutions are always encouraged to apply for ahrq support as public or private institutions of higher education:nonprofits other than institutions of higher educationgovernmentsotherahrq's authorizing legislation does not allow for-profit organizations to be eligible to lead applications under this research mechanism. for-profit organizations may participate in projects as members of consortia or as subcontractors only. because the purpose of this program is to improve healthcare in the united states, foreign institutions may participate in projects as members of consortia or as subcontractors only. applications submitted by for-profit organizations or foreign institutions will not be reviewed. organizations described in section 501(c) 4 of the internal revenue code that engage in lobbying are not eligible.hhs grants policy requires that the grant recipient perform a substantive role in the conduct of the planned project or program activity and not merely serve as a conduit of funds to another party or parties. if consortium/contractual activities represent a significant portion of the overall project, the applicant must justify why the applicant organization, rather than the party(s) performing this portion of the overall project, should be the grantee and what substantive role the applicant organization will play. justification can be provided in the specific aims or research strategy section of the phs398 research plan component sections of the sf424 (r&r) application. there is no budget allocation guideline for determining substantial involvement; determination of substantial involvement is based on a review of the primary project activities for which grant support is provided and the organization(s) that will be performing those activities.non-domestic (non-u.s.) entities (foreign institutions) are not eligible to apply. non-domestic (non-u.s.) components of u.s. organizations are not eligible to apply.applicant organizationsapplicant organizations must complete and maintain the following registrations as described in the sf 424 (r&r) application guide to be eligible to apply for or receive an award. all registrations must be completed prior to the application being submitted. registration can take 6 weeks or more, so applicants should begin the registration process as soon as possible.program directors/principal investigators (pd(s)/pi(s))all pd(s)/pi(s) must have an era commons account. pd(s)/pi(s) should work with their organizational officials to either create a new account or to affiliate their existing account with the applicant organization in era commons. if the pd/pi is also the organizational signing official, they must have two distinct era commons accounts, one for each role. obtaining an era commons account can take up to 2 weeks.note: targeting due dates on or after january 25, 2022, all individuals listed on the r&r senior/key person profile (expanded) form are required to have an era commons username (commons id). see https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/not-od-21-109.html.any individual(s) with the skills, knowledge, and resources necessary to carry out the proposed research as the program director(s)/principal investigator(s) (pd(s)/pi(s)) is invited to work with his/her organization to develop an application for support. individuals from underrepresented racial and ethnic groups as well as individuals with disabilities are always encouraged to apply for ahrq support.for institutions/organizations proposing multiple pds/pis, visit the multiple program director/principal investigator policy and submission details in the senior/key person profile (expanded) component of the sf424 (r&r) application guide. the ahrq multiple pds/pis policy can be found at https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/not-hs-16-018.html.a single pd/pi, or the multiple pd(s)/pi(s) combined, must devote at least 20% minimum full-time effort (i.e. at least 8 hours per week) in each given year of the project.this foa does not require cost sharing.while there is no cost sharing requirement included in this foa, ahrq welcomes applicant institutions, including any collaborating institutions, to devote resources to this effort. an indication of institutional support from the applicant and its collaborators indicates a greater potential of success and sustainability of the project. examples of institutional support would include: donated equipment and space, institutional funded staff time and effort, or other resource investments. applicant institutions should indicate institutional support by outlining the specific contributions to the project and providing assurances that their organization and any collaborators are committed to providing these funds and resources to the project. this information can be included at the end of the budget justification section of the application, but institutional support dollars are not to be shown/included in the detailed budget request.applicant organizations may submit more than one application, provided that each application is scientifically distinct.ahrq will not accept duplicate or highly overlapping applications under review at the same time. this means that the ahrq will not accept:the application forms package specific to this opportunity must be accessed through assist, grants.gov workspace or an institutional system-to-system solution. links to apply using assist or grants.gov workspace are available in part 1 of this foa. see your administrative office for

requirement for obtaining a unique entity identifier and for completing and maintaining active registrations in system for award management (sam), nato commercial and government entity (ncage) code (if applicable), era commons, and grants.govpart i. overview information contains information about key dates and times. applicants are encouraged to submit applications before the due date to ensure they have time to make any application corrections that might be necessary for successful submission. when a submission date falls on a weekend or federal holiday, the application deadline is automatically extended to the next business day.organizations must submit applications to grants.gov (the online portal to find and apply for grants across all federal agencies). applicants must then complete the submission process by tracking the status of the application in the era commons, nih’s electronic system for grants administration. ahrq and grants.gov systems check the application against many of the application instructions upon submission. errors must be corrected and a changed/corrected application must be submitted to grants.gov on or before the application due date and time. if a changed/corrected application is submitted after the deadline, the application will be considered late. applications that miss the due date and time are subjected to the nih policy on late application submission.applicants are responsible for viewing their application before the due date in the era commons to ensure accurate and successful submission.information on the submission process and a definition of on-time submission are provided in the sf424 (r&r) application guide.this initiative is not subject to intergovernmental review.for efficient grant administration, ahrq grant administration procedures will be used and conducted in accordance with the terms and conditions, cost principles, and other considerations described in the hhs grants policy statement. the hhs grants policy statement can be found at http://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/grants/grants/policies-regulations/hhsgps107.pdf.pre-award costs are allowable. a grantee may, at its own risk and without ahrq prior approval, incur obligations and expenditures to cover costs up to 90 days before the beginning date of the initial budget period of a new award if such costs are necessary to conduct the project and would be allowable under the grant, if awarded, without ahrq prior approval. if specific expenditures would otherwise require prior approval, the grantee must obtain ahrq approval before incurring the cost. ahrq prior approval is required for any costs to be incurred more than 90 days before the beginning date of the initial budget period of a new award.the incurrence of pre-award costs in anticipation of a competing or non-competing award imposes no obligation on ahrq either to make the award or to increase the amount of the approved budget if an award is made for less than the amount anticipated and is inadequate to cover the pre-award costs incurred. ahrq expects the grantee to be fully aware that pre-award costs result in borrowing against future support and that such borrowing must not impair the grantee's ability to accomplish the project objectives in the approved time frame or in any way adversely affect the conduct of the project.applications must be submitted electronically following the instructions described in the sf424 (r&r) application guide. paper applications will not be accepted.applicants must complete all required registrations before the application due date. section iii. eligibility information contains information about registration.for assistance with your electronic application or for more information on the electronic

the dealing with system issues guidance. for assistance with application submission, contact the application submission contacts in section vii.important reminders:all pd(s)/pi(s) must include their era commons id in the credential field of the senior/key person profile component of the sf424(r&r) application package. failure to register in the commons and to include a valid pd/pi commons id in the credential field will prevent the successful submission of an electronic application to nih. see section iii of this foa for information on registration requirements. note: targeting due dates on or after january 25, 2022, all individuals listed on the r&r senior/key person profile (expanded) form are required to have an era commons username (commons id). see https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/not-od-21-109.html.the applicant organization must ensure that the duns number it provides on the application is the same number used in the organization’s profile in the era commons and for the system for award management. additional information may be found in the sf424 (r&r) application guide.see more tips for avoiding common errors.the applicant should pay particular attention to the sf424 (r&r) application guide instructions https://grants.nih.gov/grants/how-to-apply-application-guide/forms-f/general-forms-f.pdf) concerning letters of support. letters of support, recommendation, or affirmation from any entity or individual not directly participating in the project should not be included.upon receipt, applications will be evaluated for completeness and compliance with application instructions by the center for scientific review, nih and responsiveness by ahrq applications that are incomplete or non-compliant will not be reviewed.institutional review board (irb) approval of human subjects is not required prior to peer review of an application (see https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/not-hs-00-003.html). however, initiation of irb review, if necessary or applicable, is strongly encouraged to assure timely commencement of research.although there is no immediate acknowledgement of the receipt of an application, applicants are generally notified of the review and funding assignment within eight (8) weeks.applicants are required to follow the instructions for post-submission materials, as described in not-od-19-083 - update to the nih/ahrq/niosh policy on post-submission materials and related notices.priority populationsahrq’s authorizing legislation provides that ahrq shall, in carrying out its mission, conduct and support research and evaluations, and support demonstration projects, with respect to the delivery of health care in inner-city and rural areas (including frontier areas); and health care for priority populations, which include low-income groups; minority groups; women; children; the elderly; and individuals with special health care needs, including individuals with disabilities and individuals who need chronic care or end-of-life health care. 42 u.s.c. 299(c)(1). ahrq also must ensure that these requirements are reflected in the overall portfolio of research conducted and supported by the agency. 42 u.s.c. 299(c)(2).ahrq is committed to the inclusion of priority populations in health services research. the overall portfolio of health services research that ahrq conducts and supports shall include the populations specifically named in ahrq’s authorizing legislation: inner city; rural; low income; minority; women; children; elderly; and those with special health care needs, including those who have disabilities, need chronic care, or need end-of-life health care. ahrq also includes in its definition of priority populations those groups identified in section 2(a) of executive order 13985 as members of underserved communities: black, latino, and indigenous and native american persons, asian americans and pacific islanders and other persons of color; members of religious minorities; lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (lgbtq+) persons; persons with disabilities; persons who live in rural areas; and persons otherwise adversely affected by persistent poverty or inequality.ahrq will broadly implement this inclusion policy across the research that ahrq supports and conducts so that the portfolio of research is inclusive of all populations. ahrq intends that these populations be included in studies such that the research design explicitly allows conduct of valid analyses. the policy applies to all grant applications. investigators should review the document entitled, “ahrq policy on the inclusion of priority populations,” which is available at https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/not-hs-21-015.html. applicants under this foa must consider and discuss including priority populations in research design as specified in this notice.public access to ahrq-funded scientific publicationsinvestigators should review the document titled ‘ahrq announces new policy for public access to ahrq-funded scientific publications’, which is available at (http://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/not-hs-16-008.html). for all research arising from ahrq support, this policy requires that ahrq-funded authors submit an electronic version of the author’s final peer-reviewed accepted manuscript to the national library of medicine's pubmed central (pmc) to be made publicly available within 12 months of the publisher’s date of publication.plan for sharing research datathe precise content of the data-sharing plan will vary, depending on the data being collected and how the investigator is planning to share the data. applicants who are planning to share data should describe briefly the expected schedule for data sharing; the format of the final dataset; the documentation to be provided; whether or not any analytic tools also will be provided; whether or not a data-sharing agreement will be required and, if so, a brief description of such an agreement (including the criteria for deciding who can receive the data and whether or not any conditions will be placed on their use); and the mode of data sharing (e.g., under its own auspices by mailing a disk or posting data on its institutional or personal website or through a data archive or enclave). investigators choosing to share under their own auspices may wish to enter into a data-sharing agreement. references to data sharing may also be appropriate in other sections of the application.the reasonableness of the data sharing plan or the rationale for not sharing research data will be assessed by the reviewers. however, reviewers will not factor the proposed data sharing plan into the determination of scientific merit or the priority score. please see: the agency for healthcare research and quality data management plan policy, notice number not-hs-20-011.ahrq data management plan policyinvestigators should review the document titled ahrq data management plan (dmp) policy, which is available at (https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/not-hs-20-011.html). this policy requires applicants for ahrq new/competing grants and research contracts to include a dmp for managing, storing and disseminating the primary data, samples, physical collections and other supporting materials created or gathered in the course of research funded by ahrq, or state why data management is not possible, as a component of their grant application or research contract proposal.data confidentialitythe ahrq confidentiality statute, 42 usc 299c-3(c), requires that information that is obtained in the course of ahrq supported activities and that identifies individuals or establishments be used only for the purpose for which it was supplied. information that is obtained in the course of ahrq-supported activities and that identifies an individual may be published or released only with the consent of the individual who supplied the information or is described in it. there are civil monetary penalties for violation of the confidentiality provision of the ahrq statute. 42 usc 299c-3(d). in the human subjects section of the application, applicants must describe procedures for ensuring the confidentiality of the identifying information to be collected (see not-hs-18-012: confidentiality in ahrq-supported research). the description of the procedures should include a discussion of who will be permitted access to this information, both raw data and machine readable files, and how personal identifiers and other identifying or identifiable data will be restricted and safeguarded. identifiable patient health information collected by grantees under this rfa will also be obtained and managed in accordance with the hipaa privacy rule, 45 cfr parts 160 and 164.the grantee should ensure that computer systems containing confidential data have a level and scope of security that equals or exceeds that established by the hipaa security rules if applicable (see hipaa website in prior paragraph) and that established by the office of management and budget (omb) in omb circular no. a-130, appendix iii - security of federal automated information systems. the applicability and intended means of applying these confidentiality and security standards to subcontractors and vendors, if any, should be addressed in the application.sharing research resources: rights in dataunless otherwise provided in grant awards, ahrq grantees may copyright, or seek patents for, as appropriate, final and interim products and materials developed in whole or in part with ahrq support, including, but not limited to, methodological tools, measures, software with documentation, literature searches, and analyses. such copyrights and patents are subject to a royalty-free, non-exclusive, and irrevocable ahrq license to reproduce, publish, use or disseminate for any purpose consistent with ahrq’s statutory responsibilities and to authorize others to do so for any purpose consistent with ahrq’s statutory responsibilities. in accordance with its legislative dissemination mandate, ahrq purposes may include, subject to statutory confidentiality protections, making project materials, databases, results, and algorithms available for verification or replication by other researchers. in addition, subject to ahrq budget constraints, final products may be made available to the health care community and the public by ahrq or its agents if such distribution would significantly increase access to a product and thereby produce substantial or valuable public health benefits. ordinarily, to accomplish distribution, ahrq publicizes research findings but relies on grantees to publish research results in peer-reviewed journals and to market grant-supported products. ahrq requests that grantees notify the office of communications (oc) when an ahrq-funded research article has been accepted for publication in a peer-reviewed journal. researchers should submit manuscripts that have been accepted for publication in a peer-reviewed journal to journalpublishing@ahrq.hhs.gov at least four to six weeks in advance of the journal’s expected publication date.regulations applicable to ahrq grantees concerning intangible rights and copyright can be found at 45 cfr 75.322.the mission of ahrq is to produce evidence to make health care safer, higher quality, more accessible, equitable, and affordable, and to work with the u.s. department of health and human services (hhs) and other partners to make sure that the evidence is understood and used.ahrq's priority areas of focus are detailed here: https://www.ahrq.gov/funding/policies/foaguidance/index.html. as part of this mission, applications are submitted to ahrq to support health services research which are evaluated for scientific and technical merit through the ahrq peer review system.applications that are complete and responsive to the foa will be evaluated for scientific and technical merit by an appropriate objective group convened in accordance with standard ahrq peer-review procedures that are described in 42 cfr part 67, subpart a. incomplete and/or non-responsive applications or applications not following instructions given in this foa will not be reviewed. only the review criteria described below will be considered in the review process.administrative criteria: upon receipt, applications will be evaluated for completeness by the center for scientific review, national institutes of health, and for responsiveness by ahrq.merit review criteria: merit review criteria, as described below, will be considered in the review process.reviewers will provide an overall impact score to reflect their assessment of the likelihood for the project to exert a sustained, powerful influence on the research field(s) involved, in consideration of the following review criteria and additional review criteria (as applicable for the project proposed).reviewers will consider each of the review criteria below in the determination of scientific merit and give a separate score for each. an application does not need to be strong in all categories to be judged likely to have major scientific impact. for example, a project that by its nature is not innovative may be essential to advance a field.does the project address an important problem or a critical barrier to progress in the field? is the prior research that serves as the key support for the proposed project rigorous? if the aims of the project are achieved, how will scientific knowledge, technical capability, and/or clinical practice be improved? how will successful completion of the aims change the concepts, methods, technologies, treatments, services, or preventative interventions that drive this field?are the pd(s)/pi(s), collaborators, and other researchers well suited to the project? if early stage investigators or those in the early stages of independent careers, do they have appropriate experience and training? if established, have they demonstrated an ongoing record of accomplishments that have advanced their field(s)? if the project is collaborative or multi-pd/pi, do the investigators have complementary and integrated expertise; are their leadership approach, governance and organizational structure appropriate for the project? is the single pd/pi, or are the multiple pd(s)/pi(s) combined, devoting at least 20% annual full-time effort (i.e. at least 8 hours per week) in each given year of the project?does the application challenge and seek to shift current research or clinical practice paradigms by utilizing novel theoretical concepts, approaches or methodologies, instrumentation, or interventions? are the concepts, approaches or methodologies, instrumentation, or interventions novel to one field of research or novel in a broad sense? is a refinement, improvement, or new application of theoretical concepts, approaches or methodologies, instrumentation, or interventions proposed?are the overall strategy, methodology, and analyses well-reasoned and appropriate to accomplish the specific aims of the project? have the investigators included plans to address weaknesses in the rigor of prior research that serves as the key support for the proposed project? have the investigators presented strategies to ensure a robust and unbiased approach, as appropriate for the work proposed? are potential problems, alternative strategies, and benchmarks for success presented? if the project is in the early stages of development, will the strategy establish feasibility and will particularly risky aspects be managed? has the applicant considered equity issues relevant to their project and, where equity issues have been identified, proposed a plan to address these issues?will the scientific environment in which the work will be done contribute to the probability of success? are the institutional support, equipment and other physical resources available to the investigators adequate for the project proposed? will the project benefit from unique features of the scientific environment, subject populations, or collaborative arrangements?as applicable for the project proposed, reviewers will evaluate the following additional items while determining scientific and technical merit, and in providing an overall impact score, but will not give separate scores for these items.how well does the proposed research plan align with ahrq’s mission and research priorities?inclusion of priority populationspeer reviewers will assess
