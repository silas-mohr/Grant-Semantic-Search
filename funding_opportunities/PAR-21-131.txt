Pilot Effectiveness Trials for Treatment, Preventive and Services Interventions (R34 Clinical Trial Required)
national institutes of health (nih)national institute of mental health (nimh)r34 planning grant see notices of special interest associated with this funding opportunitysee section iii. 3. additional information on eligibility.nimh solicits clinical trial applications through a series of funding opportunity announcements (foas) that cover the intervention development pipeline, from first-inhuman, early testing of new interventions, confirmatory efficacy trials, through to effectiveness trials. the purpose of this foa is to encourage pilot research consistent with nimh's priorities for: 1) effectiveness research on preventive and therapeutic interventions with previously demonstrated efficacy, for use with broader target populations or for use in community practice settings, and 2) research on the development and preliminary testing of innovative services interventions.consistent with the nimh experimental therapeutics approach, this foa is intended to support pilot studies of intervention effectiveness or service delivery approaches that explicitly address whether the intervention engages the target(s)/mechanism(s) presumed to underlie the intervention effects (i.e., the mechanism(s) that accounts for changes in clinical/functional outcomes, changes in provider behavior, improved access or continuity of services, etc.). in this pilot effectiveness phase of research, nimh places highest priority on intervention and service delivery approaches that can be justified in terms of their potential to substantially impact practice and public health.this foa supports pilot studies and provides resources for evaluating the feasibility, tolerability, acceptability and safety and preliminary effectiveness of approaches to improve mental health/functional outcomes, to modify risk factors, or to improve service delivery, and for obtaining the preliminary data needed as a pre-requisite to a larger-scale effectiveness trial (e.g., comparative effectiveness study, pragmatic trial). support for fully-powered effectiveness studies is provided through separate foas that utilize the r01 mechanism for single-site effectiveness trials (par-21-130; "clinical trials to test the effectiveness of treatment, preventive, and services interventions (r01).") and collaborative r01 mechanism for multi-site effectiveness trials (par-21-129;"clinical trials to test the effectiveness of treatment, prevention, and services interventions (collaborative r01 clinical trial required)"). applicants pursuing other stages of the clinical trial pipeline should consider one of the companion foas listed above.30 days prior to the application due dateall applications are due by 5:00 pm local time of applicant organization. all types of non-aids applications allowed for this funding opportunity announcement are due on the listed date(s).applicants are encouraged to apply early to allow adequate time to make any corrections to errors found in the application during the submission process by the due date.not applicableit is critical that applicants follow the instructions in the research (r) instructions in the sf424 (r&r) application guide, except where instructed to do otherwise (in this foa or in a notice from nih guide for grants and contracts).conformance to all requirements (both in the application guide and the foa) is required and strictly enforced. applicants must read and follow all application instructions in the application guide as well as any program-specific instructions noted in section iv. when the program-specific instructions deviate from those in the application guide, follow the program-specific instructions.applications that do not comply with these instructions may be delayed or not accepted for review.there are several options available to submit your application through grants.gov to nih and department of health and human services partners. you must use one of these submission options to access the application forms for this opportunity.purposethe purpose of this funding opportunity announcement (foa) is to encourage pilot research consistent with nimh's priorities for: 1) effectiveness research on preventive and therapeutic interventions with previously demonstrated efficacy, for use with broader target populations or for use in community practice settings, and 2) research on the development and preliminary testing of innovative services interventions. applications should provide resources for evaluating the feasibility, tolerability, acceptability, safety and preliminary effectiveness of approaches to improving mental health or functional outcomes, or modifying risk factors, and for obtaining the preliminary data needed as a pre-requisite to a larger-scale effectiveness trial (e.g., comparative effectiveness trial, pragmatic trial). in this pilot phase of effectiveness research, nimh places the highest priority on approaches that can be justified in terms of their potential to substantially impact practice and public health (i.e., in terms of the magnitude of likely improvements in clinical benefit, safety/tolerability profile, value and efficiency, or scalability potential, as compared to existing approaches) and are empirically grounded.adaptations or augmentations of efficacious preventive, therapeutic, or services interventions should only be undertaken if there is (a) an empirical rationale for the adaptation/augmentation target (i.e., a clear association of the adaptation/augmentation with non-response, partial response, patient non-engagement, or relapse), (b) a clear hypothesis and plan to address the mechanism by which the adapted intervention or augmentation will enhance outcomes, and (c) evidence to suggest that the adapted intervention will result in a substantial improvement in response rate, speed of response, an aspect of care, or uptake in community/practice settings.consistent with the nimh experimental therapeutics approach, this foa is intended to support pilot tests of intervention effectiveness or service delivery approaches that explicitly address whether the intervention engages the target(s)/mechanism(s) presumed to underlie the intervention effects (i.e., the mechanism that accounts for changes in clinical/functional outcomes, changes in provider behavior, improved access or continuity of services, etc.). the goal is to re-confirm whether the intervention targets and the associated change mechanisms previously identified under more controlled efficacy conditions are operative in the effectiveness context. in this manner, the results of the pilot effectiveness trial will advance knowledge regarding therapeutic change mechanisms and inform decisions about whether further effectiveness testing is warranted (see support for clinical trials at nimh).intervention "targets" and change mechanisms will vary depending on the nature of the intervention, but in all cases should be empirically justified. for preventive and therapeutic interventions, targets include factors that have been empirically associated with risk for or the etiology, maintenance, severity/course of the disorder or condition of interest. these targets might involve specific psychological, behavioral processes, or interpersonal processes (e.g., cognitive-affective processes such as emotion regulation, attention bias, cognitive control, stress regulation) or neurobiological entities (e.g., brain circuits).this foa is also intended to support research on the development and preliminary testing of innovative services interventions. targets/mechanisms for such services interventions might involve mutable consumer- or provider- behaviors, or organizational-/system- level factors that are intervened upon in order to improve access, continuity, quality, equity, and/or value of services.valid and reliable measures of change in the hypothesized target(s)/mechanism(s) will provide useful information about key change mechanisms that account for intervention effects. in the assessment of target engagement, nimh encourages the use of measures that are as direct and objective as is feasible in the effectiveness setting. specifically encouraged are empirically validated measures of the construct that extend beyond self-reports and other subjective measures, where possible, and inclusion of measures that span more than one level of assessment if possible and appropriate.this r34 foa supports pilot effectiveness studies focused on refining and optimizing preventive and therapeutic interventions with previously demonstrated efficacy for use with broader target populations or for use in community practice settings in anticipation of fully-powered trials (e.g., practical trials). with appropriate justification, effectiveness testing of preventive and therapeutic interventions might be warranted in the absence of extensive efficacy data (e.g., when the intervention is primarily comprised of research informed strategies, but the specific strategies that haven't been extensively tested in combination or with a specific target population; when there is strong pilot data and the goal is to conduct further testing in a deployment-focused manner to expedite the translation into practice). to reduce the alarming fall-off in effect sizes from efficacy to effectiveness studies, and to expedite translation from intervention development to practice-ready interventions, this foa can be used to conduct pilot trials in community settings as early as possible following a demonstration of efficacy. researchers interested in novel intervention development that is explicitly focused on the initial translation of neurobiological, basic cognitive and behavioral science findings into novel interventions are referred to the webpage on support for clinical trials at nimh.to facilitate the translations into practice:effective prevention and treatment of mental illness have the potential to reduce morbidity and mortality associated with intentional injury (i.e., suicide attempts and deaths, see: www.suicide-research-agenda.org). lack of attention to the assessment of these outcomes has limited our understanding regarding the degree to which effective mental health interventions might offer prophylaxis. accordingly, where feasible and appropriate, nimh encourages effectiveness research that includes assessment of suicidal behavior in clinical trials in response to this foa using strategies that can facilitate integration and sharing of data (e.g., see not-mh-15-009 and https://www.phenxtoolkit.org/ for example constructs and corresponding assessment strategies).potential applicants are strongly encouraged to contact scientific/research contacts as far in advance as possible to discuss the potential clinical practice/public health impact of the proposed pilot investigation, as well as concordance with current nimh priorities.information about the mission, strategic plan, and research interests of the nimh can be found on the nimh website. applicants are also strongly encouraged to review the information on support for clinical trials at nimh and the nimh webpage on clinical research.scope of pilot researchpilot effectiveness studies in response to this announcement should propose the developmental work that would justify and inform the design of a subsequent randomized controlled trial (rct) or a highly rigorous trial in community treatment settings where randomization is not possible. pilot trials should be explicitly designed to enhance the probability of obtaining meaningful results in subsequent well-powered trials by including measures of action (i.e., assessment of presumed mechanisms, such as specific neurobiological entities (e.g., brain circuits) or psychological or behavioral processes (e.g., attention bias, cognitive control, stress regulation)) that are presumed to underlie the intervention effects and account for changes in clinical/functional outcomes, changes in provider behavior, systems level improvements, etc., as appropriate and feasible in the effectiveness context. for studies that involve preventive or therapeutic interventions, as appropriate, the study should take into account research domain criteria (rdoc) or rdoc-like constructs when defining the subject eligibility (inclusion), intervention targets or mechanisms, and outcomes (see the rdoc webpage for more details). in this manner, pilot study results – whether positive or negative – will provide information of high utility to the field by informing decisions about whether further testing is warranted and by advancing knowledge regarding therapeutic change mechanisms.this pilot foa also affords an opportunity to refine and pilot test the experimental protocols, including the assessment protocol, the experimental intervention protocol (e.g., the manual for a psychosocial intervention, the dosing schedule for a psychosocial or pharmacological approach), and the comparison intervention protocol and randomization procedures (if appropriate); to examine the feasibility of recruiting and retaining participants into the study conditions (including the experimental condition and the comparison condition, if relevant); and to explore the feasibility of delivering the intervention with the target population (e.g., a case series in a community practice setting).accordingly, the collection of preliminary data regarding feasibility, acceptability, safety, tolerability, and target outcomes is appropriate. given the intended pilot nature of the r34 mechanism, conducting formal tests of clinical outcomes or attempting to obtain an estimate of an effect size is often not justified. given the limited sample sizes typically supportable under this pilot study mechanism, the variability in the effect sizes obtained is often so large as to be unreliable. thus, using these potentially unstable effect size estimates in power calculations for larger studies, without regard to clinical meaningfulness, is not advisable.pilot effectiveness studiesnimh supports intervention research to examine effectiveness (i.e., the utility of research-based approaches in community practice settings) and research to optimize, sequence, and personalize intervention approaches for improved response rates, more complete and rapid remission, improved functional outcomes, more efficient clinical practice or improved organizational or system functioning. such studies might focus on empirically justified new, adapted, or augmented interventions designed to significantly improve outcomes or facilitate their uptake; strategies that employ predictors or moderators of treatment response (e.g., clinical/socio-demographic information, measures of neuropsychological functioning, biomarkers, surrogate markers of early response) to construct and test algorithms for more personalized treatment selection, sequencing, or step-wise approaches to care; and more efficient, scalable strategies for implementing interventions (e.g., technology-assisted approaches) that can improve the value and facilitate the dissemination and implementation of evidence-based care.the primary goal of effectiveness research and other public health-oriented practical trials is to determine whether interventions with demonstrated efficacy under tightly controlled conditions can have a measurable beneficial effect when implemented in less precisely controlled circumstances with more heterogeneous populations, providers and settings. typically, these studies have broader inclusion (i.e., relatively few exclusion criteria) and outcomes, including functioning (school, work, interpersonal, etc.), quality of life, mortality, institutionalization, and health care resource use, in addition to measures of psychiatric morbidity, and are principally aimed at informing practice and programmatic decision making.pilot effectiveness research can be considered to involve a series of steps including: (step 1) an initial step where characteristics of typical patients, providers, and the community/practice settings to which the intervention will be transported are systematically studied; (step 2) a step in which empirically suggested adaptations to improve the fit of the intervention are operationalized and incorporated in intervention manuals and materials; and (step 3) a step in which the intervention is pilot tested.step 1. a systematic assessment of the degree of fit between the un-adapted intervention and the target population/provider/setting typically precedes the refinement of interventions with demonstrated efficacy for use with new target populations or for use in community practice settings. at this step, relevant characteristics of the target population/provider/setting are specified and needed refinements to the intervention (e.g., adaptation to intervention content or format) are identified. in some cases, the information regarding the characteristics of the target population or setting that have implications for informing the adaptation may already be known from previous research, and additional step 1 activities may not be needed prior to steps 2 and 3, below. regardless of whether the information to inform the intervention adaptation is based on extant studies or based on step 1 activities, as described above, the justification for a refined or adapted intervention should be based on data describing characteristics of client subgroups, settings, care providers, or other relevant variables that are associated with non-response, partial response, relapse, or poor uptake.adaptation or augmentations of efficacious interventions should only be undertaken if there is a compelling rationale, supported by empirical evidence, that justifies the adaptation in terms of: (a) theoretical and empirical support for the adaptation target (e.g., a prognostic variable such as a neurocognitive functioning variable, that has been associated with non-response, partial response, patient non-engagement, or relapse); (b) a theoretical/empirical explanation of how the prognostic variable interferes with the response to the un-adapted intervention (i.e., a clear hypothesis regarding the mechanism by which a the prognostic variable moderates response to the un-adapted intervention or functions to disadvantage a subgroup); and (c) evidence to suggest that the adapted intervention will result in a substantial improvement in response rate, speed of response, efficiency or other aspects of care, or uptake in community/practice settings when compared to the un-adapted interventions or existing intervention approaches (see the namhc workgroup report, "from discovery to cure: accelerating the development of new and personalized interventions for mental illnesses", see recommendation 2.4.1, page 19, for additional guidance regarding the empirical justification for intervention adaptations and augmentations).applications that propose adaptations or augmentations of currently available treatments for new subpopulations or settings without strong empirical justification will be considered low priority.step 2. standardization of an intervention primarily involves further development or adaptation of the intervention protocol (e.g., psychotherapy manual, medication dosing schedule), including iterative refinements based on extant research and feedback from patients, care providers, managers, payers, and other important stakeholders, and other investigators. for preventive, therapeutic, and services interventions, a critical step involves iterative refinement (e.g., through pilot cases or a case series) to optimize the intervention dose (i.e., amount, timing, duration) and to establish the dosing that is sufficient to engage intervention targets and produce clinical benefit in the community practice context. nimh encourages a deployment-focused approach in which end-user feedback is systematically incorporated to refine the intervention and research protocols. accordingly, this step might also involve refinements to assessment strategies (e.g., measures to determine inclusion/exclusion; measures and assessment schedules to assess change mechanisms as well as psychiatric and other outcomes, including functioning, and value and efficiency; and measures to assess acceptability and usability of the intervention protocol, fidelity of implementation, and client/patient engagement and adherence).step 3. the pilot effectiveness stage involves feasibility testing of the intervention protocol and assessment strategies developed in earlier stages of intervention development/refinement. typically, data are gathered to examine the feasibility of: identifying, enrolling, and retaining participants; implementing the experimental intervention (and comparison condition, as relevant); and implementing the assessment protocols, including examining the feasibility of measures for assessing inclusion/exclusion, the fidelity of intervention delivery, mediators/moderators of response, and outcomes.while establishing feasibility and acceptability is a major goal of pilot effectiveness studies, under nimh's experimental medicine based approach to intervention development and testing (see support for clinical trials at nimh), a focus on feasibility/acceptability is necessary but not sufficient: all trials should be designed to explicitly address whether the intervention engages the target(s)/mechanism(s) presumed to underlie the intervention effects (the target(s)/mechanism(s) that accounts for changes in clinical/functional outcomes, changes in provider behavior, etc.). accordingly, the application/scope of work should address the following: 1) the empirical basis for the selection of the proximal targets (e.g., prior evidence linking the targets to the outcomes of interest; 2) plans for assessing whether the intervention leads to the hypothesized changes in proximal targets/mechanisms; and plans for a preliminary examination of whether intervention-induced changes in the targets/mechanisms are associated with changes in the outcomes of interest.depending on the characteristics of the disorder or target population, the nature of the intervention, the nature of intended providers or settings, and the stage of the research program, pilot testing may take various forms. pilot testing might involve a systematic study of an uncontrolled case series, a small randomized pilot trial to explore the feasibility of both the experimental intervention and the control condition that will be used in the subsequent definitive trial, or alternative designs (e.g., quasi-experimental designs, multiple-baseline, single-case designs).the boundaries between these three steps are not discrete. it is expected that most applications will propose research activities or methods that span all of the above-noted steps and all projects will include step 3 activities that will provide the prerequisite information needed for conducting a larger (e.g., r01) study.intervention research that addresses the objectives outlined in the nimh strategic plan is strongly encouraged. additional priorities for intervention research are detailed in the namhc workgroup report "from discovery to cure: accelerating the development of new and personalized interventions for mental illnesses." updated priorities for nimh clinical trials research are also detailed on the nimh website focused on support for clinical trials at nimh.nimh emphasizes the potential for impact on practice and public health (e.g., in terms of the magnitude of likely improvements in clinical benefit, safety/tolerability profile, value and efficiency or dissemination potential, as compared to existing approaches) in new/adapted interventions and in effectiveness studies and practical trials.consistent with recommendations of the namhc workgroup on interventions research (noted above), nimh encourages clinical trials research that will foster personalized mental health care, including studies aimed at identifying predictor/moderator variables (e.g., clinical/socio-demographic information, biomarkers, surrogate markers of early response) that can be used to characterize patients more likely to benefit from a specific treatment and, when appropriate, encourages the use of more advanced research designs that can be used to examine prescriptive approaches for matching individuals to optimal care (e.g., adaptive designs, stepped-care approaches). studies that involve randomization of large samples in pursuit of incremental gains in effect sizes, especially without attention to modifiers of response that have implications for personalizing care, will be considered lower priority. accordingly, pilot studies in anticipation of trials to examine more personalized approaches are encouraged.nimh encourages pilot effectiveness studies that maximize efficiencies and examine the feasibility of utilizing existing infrastructure (e.g., practice-based research networks, electronic medical records, administrative databases, patient registries) to increase the efficiency of participant recruitment (e.g., more rapid identification and enrollment) and to facilitate the collection of moderator data (e.g., clinical characteristics, biomarkers), longer-term follow-up data, and broader, stakeholder-relevant outcomes (e.g., mental health and general health care utilization).examples of possible nimh-relevant effectiveness research questions include, but are not limited to:applications not responsive to

of detailed research data, tools, and supporting documentation. nda links data across research projects through its global unique identifier (guid) and data dictionary technology. investigators funded under this foa are expected to use these technologies to submit data to nda.to accomplish this objective, it will be important to formulate a) an enrollment strategy that will obtain the information necessary to generate a guid for each participant, and b) a budget strategy that will cover the costs of data submission. the nda web site provides two tools to help investigators develop appropriate strategies: 1) the nda data submission cost model which offers a customizable excel worksheet that includes tasks and hours for the program director/principal investigator and data manager to budget for data sharing; and 2) plain language text to be considered in your informed consent available from the nda's data contribution page. investigators are expected to certify the quality of all data generated by grants funded under this foa prior to submission to nda and review their data for accuracy after submission. submission of descriptive/raw data is expected semi-annually (every january 15 and july 15); submission of all other data is expected at the time of publication, or prior to the end of the grant, whichever occurs first (see nda sharing regimen for more information); investigators are expected to share results, positive and negative, specific to the cohorts and outcome measures studied. the nda data sharing plan is available for review on the nda website. nda

compliance with application instructions by the center for scientific review and responsiveness by nimh. applications that are incomplete, non-compliant and/or nonresponsive will not be reviewed.nimh encourages the use of common data elements (cdes) in basic, clinical, and applied research, patient registries, and other human subject research to facilitate broader and more effective use of data and advance research across studies (see not-mh-20-067: "notice announcing the national institute of mental health (nimh) expectations for collection of common data elements").use of common data elements in nih-funded researchmany nih ics encourage the use of common data elements (cdes) in basic, clinical, and applied research, patient registries, and other human subject research to facilitate broader and more effective use of data and advance research across studies. cdes are data elements that have been identified and defined for use in multiple data sets across different studies. use of cdes can facilitate data sharing and standardization to improve data quality and enable data integration from multiple studies and sources, including electronic health records. nih ics have identified cdes for many clinical domains (e.g., neurological disease), types of studies (e.g. genome-wide association studies (gwas)), types of outcomes (e.g., patient-reported outcomes), and patient registries (e.g., the global rare diseases patient registry and data repository). nih has established a “common data element (cde) resource portal" (http://cde.nih.gov/) to assist investigators in identifying nih-supported cdes when developing protocols, case report forms, and other instruments for data collection. the portal provides guidance about and access to nih-supported cde initiatives and other tools and resources for the appropriate use of cdes and data standards in nih-funded research. investigators are encouraged to consult the portal and describe in their applications any use they will make of nih-supported cdes in their projects.applicants are required to follow the instructions for post-submission materials, as described in the policy. any instructions provided here are in addition to the instructions in the policy.note: effective for due dates on or after january 25, 2023, the data sharing plan and genomic data sharing plan (gds) as part of the resource sharing plan will not be evaluated at time of review.only the review criteria described below will be considered in the review process. applications submitted to the nih in support of the nih mission are evaluated for scientific and technical merit through the nih peer review system.a proposed clinical trial application may include study design, methods, and intervention that are not by themselves innovative but address important questions or unmet needs. additionally, the results of the clinical trial may indicate that further clinical development of the intervention is unwarranted or lead to new avenues of scientific investigation.reviewers will provide an overall impact score to reflect their assessment of the likelihood for the project to exert a sustained, powerful influence on the research field(s) involved, in consideration of the following review criteria and additional review criteria (as applicable for the project proposed).reviewers will consider each of the review criteria below in the determination of scientific merit, and give a separate score for each. an application does not need to be strong in all categories to be judged likely to have major scientific impact. for example, a project that by its nature is not innovative may be essential to advance a field.does the project address an important problem or a critical barrier to progress in the field? is the prior research that serves as the key support for the proposed project rigorous? if the aims of the project are achieved, how will scientific knowledge, technical capability, and/or clinical practice be improved? how will successful completion of the aims change the concepts, methods, technologies, treatments, services, or preventative interventions that drive this field?does the application adequately justify the significance of the research in terms of the potential effect of the proposed intervention/service delivery approach being studied and the anticipated improvement in effect size, safety/tolerability profile, value/efficiency, and scalability or dissemination potential, as compared to existing approaches? does the application adequately address both (1) the empirical basis for the anticipated effect size (e.g., citing data regarding the magnitude of the association between the target and the clinical endpoint of interest and/or effect sizes obtained in prior efficacy studies), and (2) the clinical meaningfulness of the anticipated increment in effects compared to existing approaches?if the approach is successful, is it scalable and could it be disseminated into practice given typically available resources (e.g., trained, skilled providers), typical service structures (including mh financing), and typical service use patterns?how likely is it that the proposed research will generate data that will lead to a firm conclusion about the feasibility of a regular research project grant or full scale clinical trial? does the application describe how the proposed pilot effectiveness study and data collection will inform future work?are the scientific rationale and need for a clinical trial to test the proposed hypothesis or intervention well supported by preliminary data, clinical and/or preclinical studies, or information in the literature or knowledge of biological mechanisms? for trials focusing on clinical or public health endpoints, is this clinical trial necessary for testing the safety, efficacy or effectiveness of an intervention that could lead to a change in clinical practice, community behaviors or health care policy? for trials focusing on mechanistic, behavioral, physiological, biochemical, or other biomedical endpoints, is this trial needed to advance scientific understanding?are the pd(s)/pi(s), collaborators, and other researchers well suited to the project? if early stage investigators or those in the early stages of independent careers, do they have appropriate experience and training? if established, have they demonstrated an ongoing record of accomplishments that have advanced their field(s)? if the project is collaborative or multi-pd/pi, do the investigators have

expertise in study coordination, data management and statistics? for a multicenter trial, is the organizational structure appropriate and does the application identify a core of potential center investigators and staffing for a coordinating center?does the application challenge and seek to shift current research or clinical practice paradigms by utilizing novel theoretical concepts, approaches or methodologies, instrumentation, or interventions? are the concepts, approaches or methodologies, instrumentation, or interventions novel to one field of research or novel in a broad sense? is a refinement, improvement, or new application of theoretical concepts, approaches or methodologies, instrumentation, or interventions proposed?as relevant, evaluate the extent to which applications of technology (e.g., digital health or mhealth approaches) or other innovative approaches are leveraged to facilitate the conduct of the research project (e.g., use of electronic health records or other administrative data to facilitate participant identification, data collection) and/or to increase the reach, efficiency, or effectiveness of the intervention or service delivery strategy that is being evaluated.examples of innovative elements could include adaptive sequential randomization, equipoise stratification, or technology assisted assessment and others.does the design/research plan include innovative elements, as appropriate, that enhance its sensitivity, potential for information or potential to advance scientific knowledge or clinical practice?are the overall strategy, methodology, and analyses well-reasoned and appropriate to accomplish the specific aims of the project? have the investigators included plans to address weaknesses in the rigor of prior research that serves as the key support for the proposed project? have the investigators presented strategies to ensure a robust and unbiased approach, as appropriate for the work proposed? are potential problems, alternative strategies, and benchmarks for success presented? if the project is in the early stages of development, will the strategy establish feasibility and will particularly risky aspects be managed? have the investigators presented adequate plans to address relevant biological variables, such as sex, for studies in vertebrate animals or human subjects?if the project involves human subjects and/or nih-defined clinical research, are the plans to address 1) the protection of human subjects from research risks, and 2) inclusion (or exclusion) of individuals on the basis of sex/gender, race, and ethnicity, as well as the inclusion or exclusion of individuals of all ages (including children and older adults), justified in terms of the scientific goals and research strategy proposed?how well does the study design explicitly address whether the intervention engages the mechanism that is presumed to underlie the intervention effects (the mechanism that account for changes in clinical/ functional outcomes, changes in provider behavior, etc.), so that the results will inform understanding of change mechanisms and inform decisions about whether further effectiveness testing is warranted? to what extent does the application include (1) a well-supported conceptual framework that clearly identifies the target(s)/mechanism(s) and the empirical evidence linking the target(s)/mechanism(s) to the clinical symptoms, functional deficits, or patient-, provider- or system-level behaviors/processes that the intervention seeks to improve; (2) well justified plans for assessing engagement of the target(s)/mechanism(s), including the specific measures, the assessment schedule, and the justification for the assessment strategy (e.g., evidence regarding the validity and feasibility of the proposed measures in the effectiveness context); and (3) appropriate analytic strategies that will be used to examine whether the intervention engages the target(s) and to conduct a preliminary examination of whether intervention-induced changes in the target(s) are associated with clinical benefit, as appropriate in the pilot trial? in the case of multi-component interventions, how well does the application specify the conceptual basis, assessment plan, and analytic strategy, as detailed above, for the target(s)/mechanism(s) corresponding to each intervention component, as appropriate in the effectiveness context?is there an adequate description of the steps for intervention development/refinement and a clear rationale for the choice of methods proposed? for example, does the application articulate a clear process for determining the intervention's initial degree of "fit" and the iterative process that will be used to adapt/refine the intervention for successful implementation with the target population or within the target setting?is there an appropriate rationale for the decision regarding whether or not to include a control group at this stage of pilot research? is there appropriate caution regarding plans to interpret observed outcomes given sample size limitations? does the application adequately outline the appropriateness of the sample size to accomplish the feasibility goals?when appropriate, for studies that involve preventive or therapeutic interventions, does the study take into account rdoc or rdoc-like constructs when defining the subject eligibility (inclusion), intervention targets or mechanisms, and outcomes, as feasible in the effectiveness setting?does the application include provisions for the assessment and monitoring of the fidelity of intervention delivery via procedures that are feasible and valid for use in community practice settings, as appropriate?as appropriate, to what extent does the approach incorporate design features that will help ensure that the intervention can be feasibly implemented in practice, that it is scalable, and that it is robust against implementation drift (e.g., using technology as scaffolding or expert consultation via existing resources/ other sustainable means to support delivery)?does the application include plans to involve collaborations and/or input from community practice partners/providers, consumers, and relevant policy makers in a manner that informs the research (e.g., to help ensure the interventions/service delivery approaches are acceptable, feasible, and scalable) and helps to ensure the results will have utility?to what extent does the application include plans to assess and examine consumer-, provider- and setting- level factors that might be associated with uptake, implementation fidelity, and sustained use of the approach that is being developed and tested? how well does the application describe the provider- and setting- level characteristics that will be assessed and the measures that will be used (e.g., standardized measures of provider attitudes/experience, clinic-/organizational characteristics)?are proposed outcome measures validated and generally accepted by the field; are stakeholder-relevant outcomes included, as appropriate (e.g., functioning, health services use)?does the study explore the feasibility of collecting data on potential moderators such as clinical and biological variables (e.g., blood for genetic analysis, other potential biomarkers), as appropriate, that might be used to inform or test algorithms for more prescriptive approaches?are the data and biospecimens collected in a manner that could ultimately facilitate appropriate data sharing and integration into larger databases (e.g., use of common data elements), consistent with the goal of advancing effectiveness research?for studies proposing adaptations of existing interventions for broader use, is the justification for the proposed adaptation based on data describing characteristics of client subgroups, settings, care providers or other relevant variables that are associated with non-response, partial response, relapse, or poor uptake?does the application adequately address the following, if applicablestudy designis the study design justified and appropriate to address primary and secondary outcome variable(s)/endpoints that will be clear, informative and relevant to the hypothesis being tested? is the scientific rationale/premise of the study based on previously well-designed preclinical and/or clinical research? given the methods used to assign participants and deliver interventions, is the study design adequately powered to answer the research question(s), test the proposed hypothesis/hypotheses, and provide interpretable results? is the trial appropriately designed to conduct the research efficiently? are the study populations (size, gender, age, demographic group),
