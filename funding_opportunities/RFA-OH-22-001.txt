health (niosh), centers for disease control and prevention (cdc), invites grant applications for education and research centers (ercs) that are focused on occupational safety and health training. niosh is mandated to provide an adequate supply of qualified personnel to carry out the purposes of the occupational safety and health act, and the ercs are one of the principal means for meeting this mandate.ercs are academic institutions that provide high-quality interdisciplinary graduate and post-graduate training, research training, continuing education, and outreach in the core occupational safety and health disciplines of industrial hygiene, occupational health nursing, occupational medicine, and occupational safety, as well as allied disciplines.research and research training are integral components of ercs, with erc faculty and niosh trainees conducting research on issues related to the niosh national occupational research agenda (nora) and emerging issues to advance the field of occupational safety and health.niosh ercs have regional presence to further diversify the occupational safety and health profession through their core values, mission statements and outputs.ercs serve as resources for our nation's workforce through continuing education, outreach and strong collaboration with professional associations, worker advocacy groups, businesses, industries, and public health agencies. ercs work with other institutions and organizations, including minority serving institutions and other niosh supported training programs to have a positive impact on worker health, safety, and well-being.november 17, 2021december 6, 2021december 13, 2021. 30 days prior to the application due date thereafter.january 18, 2022; october 24, 2022; october 24,

of the announcementsection i. funding opportunity description section ii. award information section iii. eligibility information section iv. application and submission information section v. application review information section vi. award administration information section vii. agency contacts section viii. other informationthe united states public health service (phs) is committed to achieving a society in which all people live long, healthy lives. the vision, mission, and goals are found in healthy people 2030, a phs-led national activity to achieve better health in the united states by the year 2030. this funding opportunity announcement (foa) is linked to the goals of healthy people 2030, that are intended to prevent work-related diseases, injuries, and deaths while improving worker health, safety, and well-being.according to healthy people 2030, more than 160 million people participate in the u.s. labor force, and their work has an intrinsic connection to their safety and health. decades of public health surveillance and research have demonstrated that work-related injuries adversely affect employers, workers, and communities. workplace settings vary widely in size, sector, design, location, processes, culture, and resources. in addition, workers themselves have different ages, genders, education levels, cultural backgrounds, health practices, vulnerabilities, and levels of access to preventive health care. this translates into great diversity and disparity in the safety and health risks for each industry sector and the need for tailored interventions.the occupational safety and health act of 1970 mandates that niosh provide an adequate supply of qualified personnel to carry out the purposes of the occupational safety and health act. niosh ercs have a key role in meeting this mandate and contribute to the institute’s core mission of preventing workplace injuries and illnesses. in 1977, niosh supported 9 ercs in 9 states and 5 health and human services (hhs) federal regions. presently, niosh supports 18 ercs across all 10 hhs regions. over 20,000 individuals graduated from ercs in the core and allied disciplines in occupational health and safety from 1977 - 2020. as capacity in occupational safety and health practice and research has increased, the number and rates of work-related injuries, illnesses, and fatalities have decreased (bls, 2021).the far-reaching impact of the covid-19 pandemic highlights the vital role occupational health and safety has in the united states and beyond. from occupational exposures that led to illness and death to the mental and economic stressors the pandemic placed across workplaces and communities, ercs responded rapidly to the needs of their students, staff and faculty and regional stakeholders by providing broad-based approaches to protection from the virus. this included guidance on proper use and decontamination of personal protective equipment, respirator fit testing, social distancing for worksites, and the use of physical protective barriers. many ercs developed communication products, resource guides, online courses, and webinars on safe work practices during the pandemic.as our nation and the world recovers from the pandemic, ercs will continue to train safety and health practitioners and researchers with the knowledge and skills to respond to natural, man-made, environmental, and public health disasters. historically, ercs have provided expertise in worker health and safety following events such as hurricanes (katrina, maria, and harvey), the deepwater horizon oil spill, illicit drug exposures to law enforcement and emergency medical services, ebola and influenza outbreaks. erc's responses have included outreach activities and research training opportunities that highlighted the expertise of erc's faculty, staff and trainees.work-related illnesses continue to have a significant public health impact, and part of niosh’s mission is to train the next generation of occupational safety and health (osh) practitioners and researchers. the national assessment of the occupational safety and health workforce documents a significant shortfall in the supply of trained osh professionals to meet demand in the united states. the report provided evidence of the continued need to support osh training and education in the core and allied disciplines.recent work by felknor, et al (2020) speaks to the 'rapid and profound changes in the future of work that will have significant implication for the education and training of osh professionals and the workforce'. niosh's network of ercs is critical in developing osh professionals prepared to respond to the changing nature of work. these changes are the result of technological advances, globalization, new and emerging risks, occupational health disparities associated with the changing demographics of the us workforce, climate change and other factors. the ercs provide well-trained graduates and professionals for federal, state, and local government agencies; not-for-profit agencies; industry; academia; business; healthcare; and labor organizations. ercs strive to enhance diversity, equity and inclusion in the safety and health workforce through training, research training, continuing education, and outreach.erc key personnel and trainees collaborate with stakeholders to develop innovative approaches to improving workplace safety and health, by the translation of research to practice (r2p) and prevention through design (ptd). niosh ercs translate scientific discoveries into practice through effective training, research, continuing education, and outreach. to learn more about the breadth and depth of niosh ercs, visit niosh’s website.ercs are located in accredited academic institutions across the country and provide graduate, post-graduate degree and academic certificate training in core and allied disciplines of osh. ercs provide interdisciplinary research training to identify, assess, address, and improve osh. ercs conduct outreach to increase awareness of work-related safety and health issues. ercs provide continuing education on osh topics to a broad range of participants to build capacity in osh. through comprehensive, integrated programs, ercs improve the safety, health, and well-being of our nation’s workforce.diversity, equity, and inclusion. in june 2019, niosh began an initiative designed to help niosh take substantive action to create greater diversity, equity, and inclusion in its workforce, the workplace and in its service to the public. this initiative led to the establishment of the diversity and inclusion (d&i) office at niosh under the office of the director. this strategic plan, that created this office, is intended to guide actions that specifically address diversity, equity, and inclusion (dei) in all aspects of niosh, including niosh's extramural programs.ercs should demonstrate a commitment to dei in all aspects of their center. this commitment should be reflected in the erc's core values, mission and outputs, including diversity, equity and inclusion in student recruitment and retention, faculty hiring and retention, academic and research training content and focus areas, outreach, and continuing education. relationships with minority serving institutions (msi) should be developed. this includes strong partnerships with historically black colleges and universities, hispanic-serving institutions, tribal colleges and universities, and asian american and pacific islander-serving institutions to serve as potential pipelines for graduate and post-graduate students, as well as opportunities for collaboration in research training, continuing education, and outreach.needs assessment. ercs must document that their proposed academic, research training, outreach, and continuing education programs meet specific regional or national workforce needs and demands. surveys of employers, alumni, participants (from ce and/or outreach activities), and other stakeholders may be used to document these needs.regional presence. ercs should demonstrate collaborative efforts by working with a diverse and broad range of organizations, institutions, businesses, federal, state, and / or local public health and regulatory agencies, labor, worker advocacy groups and professional associations. for example, collaborations and partnerships with msis to enhance diversity, equity and inclusion in worker safety, health and well-being in their region is expected. ercs are strongly encouraged to engage diverse partners in their region and to facilitate synergistic approaches to osh.applicants must identify other ercs, niosh supported training project grants (tpgs) and other niosh-supported centers in their hhs federal region, and describe how they will collaborate and build capacity in occupational safety and health, while avoiding overlap of services.objectives/outcomes. centers may have different strengths, experiences, research training opportunities, capacities and focus areas in training, education and outreach, but all should have objectives and outcomes that positively impact the us workforce. the objectives and outcomes should help niosh provide an adequate supply of highly qualified personnel to carry out the purposes of the osh act. niosh ercs have a key role in helping meet this mandate and contribute to the niosh’s core mission of providing leadership to prevent workplace injuries and illnesses with a commitment of inclusion and diversity.target population. through the niosh ercs a broad range of worker populations may be positively impacted. the applicant should clearly describe the potential public health impact of their erc through their academic training, outreach, continuing education, and research training (if applicable).collaboration/partnerships. ercs should have a regional presence through collaborations and partnerships with key stakeholders in occupational safety and health, such as professional associations, worker advocacy groups, businesses, industries, and public health agencies. ercs should work with other institutions and organizations, including msis and other niosh supported training programs to have a positive impact on worker health, safety, and well-being.evaluation/performance measurement. each erc must have an evaluation and planning core to carry out the specific aims and objectives of the erc and plan for new, dynamic situations to promote worker health, safety, and well-being. evaluation activities should be center-wide and for each erc component. the erc should define the metrics that will be used to measure and track outputs and outcomes. specific information regarding evaluation can be found at: https://www.cdc.gov/eval/.translation plan. when relevant to the goals of the erc, applicants should describe how the findings and or training may be used to promote, enhance of advance the translation of the research into practice or may be used to inform public health policy to move the field of occupational health and safety forward. niosh has established a research to practice (r2p) approach to reduce or eliminate occupational illnesses and injury by increasing the transfer and translation of knowledge, interventions, and technologies into highly effective prevention practices and products in the workplace.institutional commitment. while the stability of an erc may be enhanced by an institutional commitment of full-time faculty and administrative staff (erc center director, deputy director and program directors), niosh recognizes the changing nature of work in academia. justification should be provided if key personnel (erc center director, deputy director and program directors) are not full-time employees of the institution, with an emphasis on the sustainability of the erc.recognizing many americans are working longer and enjoying productive work, niosh has not made succession planning for erc leadership a requirement in this funding opportunity. niosh funds may be used to defray the costs of salary support for faculty and staff directly related to the erc activities. faculty salary support may not exceed 50% (.50 fte) for any one faculty member. the ce program director may be faculty or administrative staff and may receive up to 75% salary support (.75 fte). salary support for administrative personnel is not limited but should be clearly justified and within the 70/30 distribution where applicable.travel for erc leadership. erc leadership should plan to participate in annual meetings to foster collaboration and strong communication with niosh and other niosh-supported programs. center directors should budget travel support for one meeting each year in the evaluation and planning core budget. program directors for other components should include travel support for one meeting each year in their program's budget.applicants may request up to $1.8 million each year in total costs (direct and indirect costs). indirect costs are limited to 8% of

health forward. developing highly skilled and knowledgeable safety and health practitioners and researchers to advance worker health, safety and well-being is crucial to address emerging issues that are multi-regional, national, and global in scope.academic training programs (required)our nation’s workforce and workplaces are dynamic, with challenges that require solutions to eliminating and preventing work-related injuries and illnesses. state-of-the-art approaches to training and education are encouraged to ensure that erc graduates are well-equipped to respond to the ever-changing needs for protecting our nation’s workforce. niosh ercs should provide high-quality graduate training in a minimum of three academic programs. at least two academic training programs must be in the core disciplines of ih, ohn, om, or os. the other academic training programs may be for core disciplines or for allied disciplines relevant to the field of osh.niosh is committed to increasing the participation of individuals from underserved and underrepresented racial and ethnic groups, and persons with disabilities, in osh research and practice. applications must include a comprehensive plan to recruit, matriculate, train, and successfully graduate students from underserved and underrepresented groups. niosh encourages applicants to develop innovative approaches toward collaborating with msi, such as tribal colleges and universities, historically black colleges and universities, and hispanic-serving institutions. applicants should include an evaluation plan for the effectiveness and impact of reaching underserved and underrepresented populations for each component and program.for each academic training program, the applicant should thoroughly describe:core disciplines: the core disciplines in osh are ih, ohn, om, and os. niosh funding may be used to support om training in the following pathways, as described by the american board of preventive medicine under certification requirements: residency pathway, complementary pathway, and special pathway.physicians in the complementary and special pathways are eligible for niosh support to encourage more qualified physicians to enter the field of occupational medicine. the complementary and special pathways must be administered by an occupational medicine program accredited by the accreditation council for graduate medical education.allied disciplines: allied disciplines are important and relevant to the osh field and in preventing work-related injury and illnesses. as with core disciplines, training programs in allied disciplines should be approved plans of study by the institution. these may include, but are not limited to, ergonomics, industrial toxicology and biomarkers, construction safety and health, occupational injury prevention, occupational epidemiology, occupational health psychology, occupational health services research, occupational health physics, mining, and agricultural safety and health. applicants may request support for allied disciplines which they determine are, and justify as being, closely related and relevant to their regional or national osh training needs.essential components: academic training programs should have a history of attracting highly qualified and motivated applicants and of maintaining a critical mass of students for a viable, sustainable program. academic programs should have highly qualified faculty with a strong teaching record and history of independent research support or occupational health practice.the academic training program curriculum should be comprehensive and fully prepare trainees to advance the osh field. occupational medicine residency programs must be fully accredited by the acgme. accreditation of other training programs is not required but is encouraged if appropriate to the field (for example, abet accreditation for engineering and industrial hygiene programs).an erc may provide training in as many core or allied osh programs for which needs are documented and available resources allow. each academic program should provide trainees with core competencies to be successful in their field of study. clinical rotations and field experiences across settings are encouraged to provide trainees with a broad understanding of the working environment. applicants are also encouraged to consider non-discipline specific competencies (leadership, management, and communication skills), see felknor, et al (2020).niosh funding may be used to support graduate training in core and allied disciplines for advanced degrees at the masters and doctoral levels in relevant academic programs, including, but not limited to: msn, moh, msph, mph, ms, drph, scd, phd, and dnp. niosh funding may also be used to support students in academic certificate programs in core and allied disciplines of osh. undergraduate degrees and non-academic certificate programs are not authorized under this program.required academic content: trainees must be instructed in the responsible conduct of research. niosh follows the nih policies for this requirement. topics should include scientific integrity, conflict of interest, responsible authorship, policies for handling misconduct, data management, data sharing, and policies regarding the use of human and animal subjects. for scientific integrity, it is beneficial to discuss the relationship and the specific responsibilities of the institution and the student.academic certificate programs: academic certificate programs in core and allied disciplines at the graduate level may use niosh funds to provide trainee support for tuition and fees only. niosh certificate trainees must meet the admission requirements for the academic certificate program of the institution. niosh funds may not be used for stipends, travel, or other non-tuition expenses. the certificate program must be described and recognized as a formal academic program by the applicant institution, with courses and experiences to enhance professionals’ skills, knowledge, and practice in osh. the need for academic certificate training must be fully documented.evaluation and planning core (required)the evaluation and planning core is necessary to carry out the specific aims and objectives of an erc and plan for new directions and response to dynamic situations to promote worker health, safety, and well-being. the core should include administration, evaluation and planning, interdisciplinary activities, executive committee, and advisory board. an emerging issues program is optional.elements of an effective evaluation and planning core include (1) the coordination and integration of erc components and activities; (2) a program logic model and an evaluation plan that uses the input of key stakeholders and needs assessment data in forming the overall erc strategic plan, defines metrics that will be used to measure and track outputs and outcomes, and describes the intended long-term goals and potential impact of the erc and each erc component; (3) the organization and input of an external advisory board; and (4) a plan for interactions with other niosh-supported centers, tpgs and other appropriate groups or organizations. the erc should have a strategic plan complete with a vision, mission and goals that specifically includes diversity, equity, and inclusion.center administration: an erc must have a strong leader and leadership team committed to the success of the erc and its components. the leadership provides the administration and integration of all erc programs including strategic foresight, short-term and long-term planning, as well as daily management of the erc's operations. an organizational chart may be included to illustrate the structure, interactions, and key personnel of the erc.applicants should describe inputs, outputs, intermediate outcomes, and expected long-term outcomes in their logic models. the cdc document "applying the knowledge to action framework" is a useful resource.interdisciplinary activities: ercs must plan interdisciplinary activities to enhance niosh trainees’ skills and knowledge across disciplines. this plan should include a comprehensive listing of courses and activities, including field experiences, webinars, clinical rotations, and other opportunities which promote strong, meaningful interactions with erc trainees and faculty. niosh trainees and erc faculty should be fully engaged in these activities to support an understanding and awareness of the interdisciplinary nature of osh practice and research.executive committee: this committee should include the erc director, deputy director, academic training program directors, research training program directors (if applicable), continuing education and outreach program directors and others needed for the successful operation of the erc.advisory board: the erc should establish an external advisory board of stakeholders in osh and should include recognized leaders across sectors representing labor, industry, business, government agencies, academic institutions, and professional associations. the advisory board may include alumni of the erc. the board should meet at least annually and provide counsel to the erc’s executive committee on setting and reaching goals and ensuring that the erc is progressive, dynamic, and meeting local, regional, and national osh workforce needs. the erc should strive to have a diverse advisory board that reflects the region they serve.emerging issues program: is optional and under the direction and discretion of the erc director to support new initiatives, emerging issues, and provide just-in-time support for ongoing activities.the applicant must clearly describe the core activities and the integration of all the erc components for a strong, dynamic, and sustainable erc.continuing education program (required)ercs should develop innovative and collaborative continuing education (ce) programs of high quality and relevance to the occupational safety and health professionals' disciplines. ce is regarded as a critical link between academic and research training and osh practitioners.ce programs may use a variety of modalities, including workshops, classroom instruction, and online and other virtual teaching methods, to reach their targeted audience. needs assessments should support the choice of topics, subject matter, course content, length of training and teaching methods. ercs are encouraged to build partnerships with public and private institutions and agencies, non-profits, and professional associations to support ce programs and provide new ways of delivering leading-edge programs. ce programs should take advantage of the available expertise of erc faculty and other collaborators. erc faculty should contribute to the ce program through course development, content, presentations and/or evaluation. collaboration with osh stakeholders and innovative and efficient approaches to ce are strongly encouraged, including options to support regional or national consortia or webinars for ce for osh professions.while an erc may provide ce content in any number of areas, ercs are not required to provide ce to all osh disciplines. for example, an erc that does not have an approved om academic training program is not required to provide ce or cme in occupational medicine.a ce activity may target professions outside the realm of osh to provide new skills and enhanced knowledge in worker protection and well-being. for example, a ce offering targeting family physicians, internists, nurse practitioners or physician assistants with content on work-related injuries and illness prevention and treatment, and workers' compensation is appropriate and may address an identified need.ce efforts should be based on the documented needs of osh practitioners, employers, and other stakeholders in the erc’s region and build on the strengths and areas of expertise of the erc.ce programs should use effective training techniques, tools, and delivery modalities to engage the adult learner and to prepare skilled and knowledgeable practitioners in osh. ce programs should be a mechanism for the transfer of knowledge into workplace practices and policies to improve worker safety, health, and well-being.a successful ce program should strive to have a broad reach through collaboration with other ercs, tpgs, professional associations, federal/state/local agencies and municipalities, institutions, nonprofits, and other stakeholders. where appropriate, continuing education units from approved providers should be awarded.outreach program (required)outreach is broad in scope and includes activities that will have a positive impact on a diverse workforce. there should be efforts to reach vulnerable worker populations, underserved and underrepresented groups, to meet local, regional, or national needs.examples of impactful erc outreach may include:an awareness seminar given to local government employees on worker well-being and total worker health®this list is not comprehensive, nor is it limited to these examples of outreach activities. ercs have taken many innovative approaches in outreach and pivoting through the years to meet demand and need.pilot project research training program (optional)this program is optional and supports projects relevant to the nora. pilot project programs are intended to explore and develop new and creative prevention, intervention, and translation projects, and they are considered an important and integral part of the support provided to an erc. applicants receiving support from this program should be junior faculty, new faculty investigators, or mentored students. the research projects should be of short duration (12 - 18 months) and not more than $20,000 direct costs. the research plan should include a mentoring plan and identify the mentor(s) who will be supporting and advising the research trainee. the program director should have the qualifications to effectively manage and support the goals.this program will enable investigators to collect sufficient data to pursue subsequent support through other funding mechanisms. examples of pilot projects include:the applicant should have goals that are relevant to the nora and should provide a description that includes these elements:targeted research training program (optional)through this optional component, ercs are encouraged to provide research training that is responsive to the nora and generate new knowledge in the field of osh. the research training is expected to clearly enhance an individual’s potential to develop into productive, independent researchers to address challenges in protecting workers’ health and safety and to advance research findings into the workplace.this training program should allow trainees from various disciplines to acquire a strong set of skills in research study and design, epidemiological methods, biostatistics, measures of outcomes, determining impact, and ethical and regulatory principles of research. in addition to the core competencies in research, trainees should be knowledgeable in non-discipline-specific competencies such as leadership, management, and communication. strong communication skills in research to practice are needed to move the field of osh forward.trainees must be instructed in the responsible conduct of research. niosh follows the nih policies for this requirement. topics should include scientific integrity,

review boards (irb), the assistance irbs provide to researchers, and research ethics.this program should be under the direction of an experienced, highly qualified osh investigator. trainees supported in the program may be degree-seeking students from osh core or allied disciplines, or students from other disciplines interested in applying their knowledge and skills to a specific osh research question. for graduate students, support may include stipends, tuition and fees, and travel. the program may also support post-doctoral trainees in a core osh or allied field. post-doctoral students may receive stipends, and travel. the prospective trainee must have completed a doctoral degree in a discipline relevant to osh or a field that qualifies them to conduct mentored research in osh. the proposed post-doctoral training will consist of 1 - 3 years of mentored research training in relevant topic area(s).post-doctoral research training: prospective post-doctoral trainees will apply and compete for these positions, and the successful candidate will be matched with a suitable mentor and have an advisory committee that consists of the primary mentor and one or more faculty advisors to guide progress.the program should include plans to reach, recruit and retain underserved and underrepresented trainees to increase diversity in the field of osh.to demonstrate adequate faculty resources for mentoring, the erc faculty should have sufficient expertise and experience to mentor post-doctoral candidates. evidence for the latter should include a detailed description of the proposed faculty mentor track record in training doctoral and post-doctoral trainees, and a record of where graduates now work. mentors should have an established track record of research and research training in areas related to osh and be members of the erc academic training core. faculty active grant support, resources and environment for advanced research training should be described in the narrative. resource faculty, who are not proposed primary mentors, but who bring added expertise (for example, biostatistics, toxicology, and behavioral science) may be included as members of trainees' advisory committees. supported trainees should participate in erc interdisciplinary activities to fully understand the broad scope of occupational safety and health.for policies related to

https://www.hhs.gov/civil-rights/for-providers/provider-obligations/index.html and http://www.hhs.gov/ocr/civilrights/understanding/section1557/index.html.hhs recognizes that research projects are often limited in scope for many reasons that are nondiscriminatory, such as the principal investigator’s scientific interest, funding limitations, recruitment requirements, and other considerations. thus, criteria in research protocols that target or exclude certain populations are warranted where nondiscriminatory justifications establish that such criteria are appropriate with respect to the health or safety of the subjects, the scientific study design, or the purpose of the research. for additional guidance regarding how the provisions apply to nih grant programs, please contact the scientific/research contact that is identified in section vii under agency contacts of this foa.please contact the hhs office for civil rights for more information about obligations and prohibitions
