invites r61/r33 applications proposing to establish and conduct a networking and infrastructure project to enhance the development of comparative research on determinants of differences among human and nonhuman primate life spans, life histories, and other aging-related outcomes, and prospects for translating findings from this research into development of human interventions.while letters of intent are typically due 30 days before the application due date, for this foa they are due august 13, 2023.all applications are due by 5:00 pm local time of applicant organization.applicants are encouraged to apply early to allow adequate time to make any corrections to errors found in the application during the submission process by the due date.no late applications will be accepted for this funding opportunity announcement.not applicableit is critical that applicants follow the instructions in the research (r) instructions in the sf424 (r&r) application guide, except where instructed to do otherwise (in this foa or in a notice from nih guide for grants and contracts).conformance to all requirements (both in the application guide and the foa) is required and strictly enforced. applicants must read and follow all application instructions in the application guide as well as any program-specific instructions noted in section iv. when the program-specific instructions deviate from those in the application guide, follow the program-specific instructions.applications that do not comply with these instructions may be delayed or not accepted for review.there are several options available to submit your application through grants.gov to nih and department of health and human services partners. you must use one of these submission options to access the application forms for this opportunity.the purpose of this funding opportunity announcement (foa) is to invite r61/r33 applications proposing to establish and conduct a networking and infrastructure project to enhance the development of comparative research on determinants of differences among human and nonhuman primate life spans, life histories, and other aging-related outcomes, and prospects for translating findings from this research into development of human interventions. nia intends to fund a single award in response to this foa.this foa is a companion to rfa-ag-24-019, comparative research on determinants of differences among human and nonhuman primate species in life spans, life histories, and other aging-related outcomes, and prospects for translation, which invites r01 research projects in this topic area and describes specific topics of interest. applicants for the r01 awards may also be included as personnel in applications for this networking/infrastructure project award.the networking and infrastructure project selected for funding will address key needs for activities and infrastructure to promote development of this new research field. it will foster interactions and collaborations among researchers on topics including human longevity, aging biology, comparative biology, evolutionary genetics and biology, biological anthropology, neuroscience, and primatology. interactions among several of these fields have been limited. to amplify synergy among projects funded through the companion r01 rfa, the project will support infrastructure to enhance the sharing of ideas and data, opportunities for pooling data, and interdisciplinary analyses. it will also provide a venue and support for researchers from relevant fields (including, but not limited to, researchers supported by the r01 projects) to develop concepts for additional research on determinants of species differences in human and nonhuman primate life spans and age-related outcomes through research planning, including data analyses and pilot studies needed for designing new projects. in addition, the networking/infrastructure project will enhance the quality and availability of data sources needed to design and implement research in this field through activities such as harmonizing data, creating new databases, increasing interoperability of existing data sources, and establishing public websites and other information architecture.this foa solicits applications that include expertise from multiple research disciplines such as human longevity, aging biology, comparative biology, evolutionary genetics and biology, biological anthropology, neuroscience, and primatology, in conjunction with expertise in coordinating diverse research projects, database management, statistics, and informatics. applicants are encouraged to consider a multi-principal investigator project to ensure that investigators with expertise spanning the above topics have significant project involvement.the proposed networking/infrastructure project must have three main objectives:1) to enhance the quality and synergy of projects supported through r01 research projects funded in response to rfa-ag-24-019, and to enhance the public accessibility of their results.2) to identify promising directions for future research on determinants of species differences in human and nonhuman primate life spans and age-related outcomes through planning activities that engage researchers from pertinent fields (including, but not limited to, researchers supported by the r01 projects).3) to enhance the quality, public availability, and interoperability of data sources needed to design and implement research on determinants of species differences in human and nonhuman primate life spans and age-related outcomes.each of the three above objectives must be addressed in the study aims and through activities proposed in the application.examples of activities related to these objectives include, but are not limited to:in addition, applications must include plans to design and maintain a user-friendly website and/or other information architecture with:1) internal features to facilitate sharing of data and other collaborative activities among investigators supported by the r61/r33 and companion r01 awards, including sharing of schedules and documentation on meetings, and shared access to data where appropriate.2) public features to share information about ongoing studies, data and specimen resources, and best practices.the project application must define the structure and operational procedures it will use to integrate the project team’s expertise in human longevity research and nonhuman primate research with its expertise in project coordination, data management, statistics, and informatics, to address its objectives.it is expected that r61/r33 activities will be developed in collaboration with r01 awardees funded under the companion foa. applications must describe proposed steps for establishing and implementing collaborative activities.this foa uses the phased r61/r33 mechanism, in which initial activities toward the three main objectives described above are conducted during the r61 phase, followed by an extension of these activities in the r33 phase. the project selected for funding will receive up to two years of support for the r61 phase, followed by up to three years of support for the r33 phase, contingent on reaching project milestones for the r61 phase.the application must provide separate specific aims for each of the r61 and the r33 phases. for each specific aim, the application must define milestones for the r61 phase and milestones for the r33 phase, and timelines for reaching them. milestones should be defined as “deliverables” (e.g., plans, resources, research activities).applicants’ proposed milestones for both the r61 and r33 phases will be evaluated in peer review and by nia program staff prior to award. in response to peer and program review, milestones may be modified or added and will be included in the terms of the award. milestones may also be modified at the time of transition to the r33 award. nia will appoint an independent monitoring board including experts from pertinent fields to assist in assessing study progress in reaching milestones during the r61 and r33 phases and assessing proposed new activities in the r33 phase.prior to the end of the r61 phase, grantees will be expected to submit a package requesting transition to the r33 phase. this transition package will be reviewed by nia program staff and must include: a progress report describing the achievements of the r61 phase, including success in reaching r61 milestones, and plans for the r33 phase, including updated milestones if appropriate. if the transition package is approved, the r33 will be awarded for the remainder of the project period without the need to submit a new grant application.r61 and r33 fociwhile selection of specific activities and milestones for each of the r61 and r33 phases will depend on the project team’s resources, priorities, and specific aims, appropriate general foci for the r61 phase include, but are not limited to:in the r33 phase, operational and administrative coordination should be well established for the research network. r33 phase foci should be on extending activities developed during the r61 phase. appropriate general foci for the r33 phase include, but are not limited to:appropriate selection of specific activities in the r33 phase (e.g., of pilot studies, database construction) will depend in part on results in the r61 phase and on findings from the r01 projects and other studies during the time period of the r61 phase. in such cases, applicants for the r61/r33 award are not required to identify specific topic areas for projects in their competing applications. however, the r61/r33 application must describe proposed processes in the r33 for identifying potential activities, assessing their quality and priority by internal and/or external review, selecting them, and assessing and reporting their progress. greater detail on proposed r33 activities will be required in the package submitted for nia approval to transition from the r61 phase. nia’s independent monitoring board will assist nia in evaluating proposed new specific activities in the r33 phase.the following types of applications will be considered non-responsive and will be withdrawn prior to review:additional information related to research on determinants of primate species life span differences (including animal, specimen, imaging, and data resources) is available in a report based on a recent nia workshop on this topic. in addition, frequently asked questions and answers about the r61/r33 foa will be posted here.prospective applicants for this award are encouraged to join a planned nia webinar with representation from nia’s division of geriatrics and clinical gerontology, division of aging biology, division of behavioral and social research, and division of neuroscience. this webinar will include an overview of the initiative and address potential applicants’ questions related to the scope, r61/r33 phased activity, and other aspects of the project. the date of the webinar and access information will be posted here.it is recommended that potential applicants consult with nia program staff early in their process of considering or planning an application. inquiries will be directed to appropriate nia staff
