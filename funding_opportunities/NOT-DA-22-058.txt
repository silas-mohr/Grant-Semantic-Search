identifying the causes and consequences of substance use and substance use disorders (sud) across the lifespan and to guide treatment strategies. the integrative neuroscience (in) branch within dnb supports research on the cellular mechanisms and circuitry that underlie substance use and sud. research supported by the branch covers: 1) the regulation and plasticity of neurotransmitter and neuromoduatory systems induced by chronic or intermittent exposure to, and/or withdrawal from, addictive substances, 2) the study of substance-induced neurotoxicity, 3) neuron-glia interactions and their modification by substance use and sud 4) neuroendocrine modulation of neural systems in relation to substance use and sud , and 5) neuroimmune modulation of the brain including the influences of neuroaids and substance-induced neuroinflammation.the in branch encourages applications in the following priority research areas:please contact the listed program contact to answer questions and advise on the application process.large scale mapping and functional characterization of cell ensembles and cell types mediating the effects of addictive substancesin seeks applications that employ innovative scalable technologies in animal models to map, profile and functionally characterize cellular ensembles that are engaged by addictive substances and during different stages of substance use (acute, chronic, withdrawal, abstinence, relapse). emphasis is on approaches that enable the large scale integration of neurophysiological readouts of cell ensemble activity with anatomical characterization and/or molecular profiling at single cell resolution, to support the development of theoretical and computational models for the role of distributed cell assemblies in behaviors relevant to substance use.program contact: olivier berton, ph.d., olivier.berton@nih.gov, 301-827-7771leveraging transformative connectome resources in model organisms to elucidate the neurobiology of sudin seeks applications that leverage whole-brain or large connectome resources in genetically tractable small model organisms to investigate the role of distributed neuronal circuits in behaviors relevant to sud. examples include:computational studies of large-scale neuronal dynamics underlying substance-induced state transition or substance-induced behavioral plasticity of relevance to sud.scalable assays leveraging circuit activity and/or structure to investigate target engagement or abuse liability prediction.large scale connectome mapping at synaptic scale providing quantitative insight into the developmental effects of abused substances or structural correlates of inter-individual variation in response to abused substances.program contact :olivier berton, ph.d., olivier.berton@nih.gov, 301-827-7771neurobiology of the inter-relationship between sleep and sudin seeks applications focused on the neurobiological mechanisms at the intersection of sleep and sud. several brain regions and neurotransmitter systems regulate both arousal and sleep homeostasis, as well as motivation and reward. understanding the fundamental processes that link sud to sleep regulation and vice-versa could lead to novel strategies to manage the risk for development of suds, and/or identify new targets for prevention and therapeutics.program contact: sunila nair, ph. d., sunila.nair@nih.gov, 301-827-5842mechanistic studies of sex and gender differences in sud and hiv-associated neurocognitive disorders (hand)recognizing that there are significant sex differences in the characteristics of substance use, sud and their interactions with the occurrence of hand, in seeks applications that propose research on the following topics:impact of biological sex on the function and activity of discrete brain regions and neural circuits associated with differences in the initiation, expression and trajectory of substance use, sud and the occurrence of hand.program contact: sunila nair, ph. d., sunila.nair@nih.gov, 301-827-5842metabolomic approaches to understanding and treating sudin seeks applications leveraging metabolomics technologies to understand how substances alter metabolite profiles and signaling to affect neurobiological function associated with substance use and sud. metabolites are important signaling molecules in the human body playing significant roles in many biological processes. deciphering the metabolome can reveal comprehensive metabolite profiles and identify endogenous metabolites that may reveal new basic biology of sud, and possibly serve as biomarkers and potential targets of therapeutic intervention strategies for sud diagnosis and treatment. in encourages the use of advanced analytical chemistry techniques to characterize metabolic profiles using samples derived from cells, organs, tissues, or biological fluids. metabolomics have also been used in clinical medicine to study individual differences in response to both substance exposure and sud treatments. metabolites contribute to neurobiological function and processes, however, the feasibility of linking a vast number of neurochemicals and metabolites to sud phenotypes has been challenging. in seeksapplications leveraging metabolomics profiling of various samples, including but not limited to brain tissue, cns cells, cns fluid and synaptic vesicles to identify and map cns metabolites and metabolic networks altered by specific substances and their impact on brain circuitry.program contact: shang-yi tsai, ph.d, stsai@nih.gov,
