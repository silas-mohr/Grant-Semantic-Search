strategic initiatives, office of disease prevention (odp)office of research on women's health (orwh)purposethe purpose of this notice is to highlight interest in addressing the role of violence in health outcomes and integrating violence-related screening and interventions into health care settings. this notice is to encourage intervention research focused on addressing exposure to violence - including but not limited to child maltreatment, intimate partner violence/teen dating violence, elder mistreatment, peer violence/bullying, and community violence – to improve individual-level health processes and outcomes.backgroundviolence is defined by the world health organization as: “the intentional use of physical force or power, threatened or actual, against oneself, another person, or against a group or community, that either results in or has a high likelihood of resulting in injury, death, psychological harm, maldevelopment, or deprivation.” violence affects people of all ages, and its impact is far-reaching. violent victimization events are associated with not only physical injury or mortality, but also a range of acute and chronic physical and behavioral health conditions, such as obesity, cardiovascular disease, asthma, substance use disorders, depression and anxiety, sleep disturbance, impairments in cognitive development and executive functioning, and adverse birth outcomes. findings from prior research suggest that indirect (witnessing) exposures to violence have adverse effects on behavioral and physical health that are similar to the effects of direct exposures.despite recognition that violence is a serious public health issue, most behavioral and medical health care settings do not adequately screen and assess for experiences of violence as a part of routine care. there are some notable exceptions. for example, the veterans administration (va) and the department of defense (dod) health care systems have a history of integrating screening for intimate partner violence and treatment for post-traumatic stress disorder (ptsd) into their health care system, routine screenings for intimate partner violence and child maltreatment are conducted in some primary care settings, and some emergency departments have integrated violence intervention programs to reduce the recurrence of violence-related injury. however, the integration of screening for exposure to violence and for subsequent trauma symptomatology, along with the integration of treatment when appropriate, into a broader range of health care settings, has the potential to improve a wide range of health conditions for people of all ages. likewise, strategies to reduce and prevent violence perpetration and victimization that can be linked to, facilitated by, or delivered in the health care context, may have beneficial effects on physical and behavioral health conditions.furthermore, recent events including the covid-19 pandemic and racial and social justice issues have brought an increased recognition that social determinants of health and the often-intersecting burden of poverty and structural racism are drivers of population-level health disparities. reducing the disproportionate impact of violence and victimization on women, children, older adults, racial/ethnic minorities, sexual and gender minorities, and other populations that are disproportionally impacted by violence , requires attention to the sociocultural environment.this notice highlights nih’s interest in addressing the role of violence in health outcomes and encouraging intervention research in health care settings focused on addressing exposure to violence to improve individual-level health processes and outcomes. for the purposes of this notice, health care settings are broadly defined to include any organization where patients get physical or behavioral health care, including but not limited to federally qualified health centers (fqhcs), community or school-based health clinics, primary care or urgent care facilities, mobile clinics, hiv clinics, va facilities, correctional health care providers, assisted living, skilled nursing, or substance use treatment providers.research objectivesthis notice encourages novel intervention research aimed at developing, refining, adapting, and testing interventions focused on preventing violence or addressing acute and chronic effects of violence on physical and behavioral health. interventions for the treatment and prevention of violence victimization and perpetration across different populations in settings where other health conditions are treated are encouraged. in addition, interventions that seek to translate basic behavioral and social science research findings into innovative treatment approaches are encouraged. implementation research can elucidate effective strategies for moving evidence-based prevention and treatment approaches into practice. as such, effectiveness, implementation, and hybrid effectiveness-implementation designs are encouraged, as appropriate to the research questions proposed.the targets for the intervention/s being developed and tested in response to this notice should be based on research identifying a link between the health outcome and experiences of violence. interventions may be delivered at the individual, dyadic, family, group, or organizational level, in-person, virtually, or via e-health platforms, as appropriate. interventions to screen for violence exposure, prevent violence, or treat symptoms associated with exposure to violence should occur in coordination with prevention or treatment for other physical or behavioral health conditions.the primary outcomes should be the physical or behavioral health indicators relevant to the health care setting that have been linked to violence exposure. outcomes may include clinical indicators or health-related measures assessed at the individual level or shifts in behavior or health indicators that are measured at an aggregate level (e.g., clinic, community, or population). it is expected that violence perpetration, exposure, and trauma symptomatology would be measured as appropriate to the intervention targets.applicants are encouraged to employ innovative study designs for building, adapting, and optimizing behavioral interventions. intervention creation and refinement require iterative and systematic testing of intervention features and components. study timelines should include clear research steps, goals and milestones (go/no-go decision points). interdisciplinary project teams are encouraged, as are cost-effectiveness components or studies. finally, nih is committed to supporting research to enhance diversity, equity, inclusion and accessibility (deia) in biomedical and behavioral sciences research. applicants are encouraged to discuss how they will foster these principles in their proposed research activities.the office of behavioral and social sciences research (obssr) does not have grant-making authority and can only support grants deemed grants deemed meritorious after review by one of the ics participating in this announcement and after a co-funding request is initiated through the ic. please contact the relevant ic scientific/research contact(s) listed for questions regarding ic research priorities and funding. for additional information about obssr’s research priorities and interests, please refer to the obssr strategic plan.national institute of mental health (nimh) nimh will only accept aids applications for this notice.the nimh division of aids research (dar) is interested in the impact of violence on hiv testing, prevention, and treatment outcomes, with a focus on intervention and implementation research.for non-aids applications to nimh on aggression and violence research, see not-mh 22-095.research studies may include but are not limited to:national institute on drug abuse (nida)nida is interested in research on violence-focused treatment and prevention interventions (both new and adapted) for individuals exposed to violence and perpetrators of violence in harm reduction, substance use prevention, treatment, and recovery settings. key individual-level outcomes of interest include any of the following: substance use initiation, escalation, substance use disorder (sud) diagnosis, connection to treatment, and engagement or retention in treatment or address issues relevant to maintaining sustained recovery from substance use disorders over the long term. ultimately, the goal is to develop user-centered interventions addressing violence in the context of substance use that are effective, practical, cost-effective, scalable, and sustainable. therefore, applicants are strongly encouraged to consider issues of feasibility, scalability, sustainability, and translation to practice in their study designs and dissemination plans. as such, applicants should consider input from clients, patients, and stakeholders, as appropriate, to assess the feasibility of the proposed intervention in the targeted setting as appropriate to the design.research areas of interest include, but are not limited to, the following:eunice kennedy shriver institute of child health and human development (nichd)nichd is interested in basic, translational, and clinical research in pediatric trauma including exposure to and direct experiences of all forms of violence as well as violence-related injuries.research studies may include but not be limited to the following areas:national institute on alcohol abuse and alcoholism (niaaa)niaa supports research projects focused on violence prevention that are conducted in health care settings. the use and misuse of alcohol often is a factor in various forms of other- and self-directed violence, including intimate partner violence, dating violence, elder abuse, child maltreatment, bullying, sexual assault, homicide, and suicide. proposed interventions may focus on the perpetrators of the violence, the victims, or potential bystanders.national institute of dental and craniofacial research (nidcr)nidcr is interested in research on violence related to dental, oral, or craniofacial health. relevant research may identify or evaluate opportunities for dental healthcare providers to optimally contribute to violence-related screening or intervention efforts.national institute of deafness and other communication disorders (nidcd)nidcd encourages translational and interventional studies in health care settings that address the role of violence in health outcomes affecting individuals with communication disorders, specifically those disorders that cover the mission areas of hearing, balance, taste, smell, voice, speech, and language. we encourage responsive studies from across the lifespan, as children and adults with communication disorders may be vulnerable to various forms of maltreatment.meritorious studies emphasizing engagement of underrepresented minorities, including sexual and gender minorities, will be prioritized. areas of scientific interest include but are not limited to:national institute on minority health and health disparities (nimhd)the mission of nimhd is to lead scientific research to improve minority health and reduce health disparities. populations that experience health disparities include african americans/blacks, hispanic/latinos, american indians/alaska natives, asians, native hawaiians, and other pacific islanders, socioeconomically disadvantaged populations, underserved rural populations, and sexual and gender minority (sgm) populations. in the context of this nosi, nimhd is especially interested in how best to prevent or mitigate the impact of violence in these populations. nimhd is especially focused on the innovative application of community-engaged approaches and utilization of the nimhd research framework to implement violence-related screening and interventions integrated in health care settings among populations that experience health disparities and individuals with intersecting health disparity population membership, across multiple levels of influence (i.e., individual, community, societal).examples of potential topic areas include but are not limited to:national institute of nursing research (ninr)ninr supports research to solve pressing health challenges and inform practice and policy - optimizing health and advancing health equity into the future. ninr discovers solutions to health challenges through the lenses of health equity, social determinants of health, population and community health, prevention and health promotion, and systems and models of care. drawing on the strengths of nursing’s holistic, contextualized perspective, core values, and broad reach, ninr funds multilevel and cross-sectoral research that examines the factors that impact health across the many settings in which nurses work, including homes, schools, workplaces, clinics, justice settings, and the community.areas of programmatic interest to ninr include but are not limited tonational institute on aging (nia)nia welcomes research applications for the development of aging-relevant violence interventions for mid-life and older adults. nia is especially interested in interventions that can address multiple and interconnected forms of violence.research of priority to nia includes, but is not limited to the following topic areas:intervention development:office of research on women's health (orwh)the office of research on women’s
