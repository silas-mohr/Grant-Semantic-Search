discoveries have improved the health of the u.s. population overall, some populations continue to experience a disproportionate burden of disease and risk factors, unmet health care needs and other adverse health conditions. work activity is known to be important to health as a source of “exposures and risk factors,” a source of beneficial social and economic resources, and attainment of social position and status. in addition to formal work, under-employment and unpaid and informal work arrangements are also important work activities to understand. while the contribution of work to health outcomes and substantial occupational segregation for populations that experience health disparities are known, few studies have explored to what extent and by what mechanisms work explains health disparities, especially in the contexts of racial and ethnic populations and socioeconomic status. because work can be modified and is amenable to intervention, the examination of the role of work as a social determinant of health (sdoh) presents an opportunity for research that may illuminate causal pathways and potential solutions for health disparities.vast literature demonstrates the importance of work for health outcomes, mostly through direct effects due to exposures and risk factors arising from someone’s occupation or workplace experiences. for example, 8.4% of all cancer deaths are attributable to workplace exposures. workplace physical conditions such as excessive heat or cold, noise, physical exertion, and chemical hazards have been linked to multiple diseases. workplace psychosocial hazards such as job strain (low control, high psychological demands) are consistently associated with cardiovascular disease. job strain is also associated with depression, postpartum depression, and obesity. precarious employment is linked to poor mental health. underemployment is linked to lower levels of health and wellbeing than adequate employment. workplace discrimination is linked to poor mental health and substance use.work, as a source of beneficial social and economic resources, is also linked to health care outcomes and health outcomes. in the u.s., employment linked benefits constitute the primary source of health insurance coverage for about half of the population, which influences access to and use of care, and the type of insurance contributes to quality of care. work policies, such as paid sick leave, are linked to use of preventive health services, such as cancer screenings and immunizations. also, increases in paid parental leave are linked with decreases in perinatal, neonatal, post-neonatal, infant, and child mortality.profound occupational segregation in the u.s. labor force is strongly patterned by social identities that characterize populations who experience health disparities. for example, african american/black and latino/hispanic persons are the least likely to be in managerial and professional jobs and the most likely to be in service and blue-collar jobs. a national study found consistent associations between working in race-segregated occupations and poor worker health. however, the degree to which occupational segregation can be explained by education versus structural racism needs to be evaluated. another study found that occupational segregation accounted for disproportionate mortality rates for latino/hispanic and african american/black workers during the covid-19 pandemic. there is also segregation within a workplace by social identities (e.g., gender, age, social class, sexual orientation, immigrant status, formerly incarcerated, marital status, head of household) that can result in large differences in exposure to workplace hazards and receipt of benefits from workplace policies, but the extent to which this explains disparities in health and health care outcomes is unknown. structural racism and discrimination within macro-level conditions that limit opportunities, resources, and power, shown by census tract areas with high social vulnerability, are linked to substantial health disparities. however, what is not known is the extent that these place-based health disparities are due to regional or location specific income inequality, unfavorable labor market conditions, unequal occupational opportunities, and/or high unemployment rates. moreover, there are large differences in life trajectories based on someone’s work, including differences in achieving social status and position, and in access to work-related resources and social networks, but how these influence health and health care disparities is yet to be examined. given the unequal distribution of “work” among populations affected by health disparities, work is implicated in both health and health care disparities and research is needed to examine the mechanisms and pathways through which this unequal distribution influences health and health care disparities.a few studies have demonstrated proof-of-concept that occupational segregation by race and ethnicity and the resulting unequal exposure to occupational risk factors explain a proportion of the population-level disparities seen in health outcomes. for example, disproportional employment of african american/black persons in jobs with lower substantive complexity may explain up to 30% of the disparity seen in all-cause mortality rates. occupational health disparities research has mainly focused on work as a source of hazardous exposures linked with a specific health outcome. this initiative is a call for research to examine work beyond only being a source of “exposures and risk factors,” examining it also as a source of beneficial social and economic resources and attainment of social position and status.research objectivesthe main objective of this initiative is to determine the extent and mechanisms by which work as a sdoh both contributes to, and helps ameliorate, health and health care disparities. a recent workshop on september 28-29, 2020 organized by nimhd (https://www.nimhd.nih.gov/news-events/conferences-events/hd-workshop.html) highlighted key ideas for furthering research on work as a sdoh that include conceptualizing work as a social class marker, as a source of “exposures and risk factors,” and as a source of beneficial social and economic resources such as income and wealth, neighborhood conditions, health care access, education, and social networks. some key questions include: what are the specific and modifiable mechanisms by which work explains health disparities? to what extent does work as a social class marker, source of “exposures and risk factors” and/or source of beneficial social and economic resources explain health disparities? which health disparities does work as a sdoh explain?of particular interest are projects designed to examine pathways and mechanisms using conceptual model(s) grounded in minority health and health disparities theories that recognize that health disparities arise by multiple and overlapping contributing factors acting at multiple levels of influence (see the nimhd research framework, https://www.nimhd.nih.gov/about/overview/research-framework.html).studies must examine nih-designated u.s. health disparity populations, e.g. racial and ethnic minority populations, sexual and gender minority groups, underserved rural populations, and socioeconomically disadvantaged populations of any race or ethnicity (https://www.nimhd.nih.gov/about/overview/).studies involving primary data collection with human participants are strongly encouraged to incorporate sdoh measures from the core and specialty collections that are available in the social determinants of health collection of the phenx toolkit (www.phenxtoolkit.org).of interest are intersectional approaches that consider different social identities and the embeddedness of individuals within families, households, and communities. life course approaches that consider the role of work in shaping cumulative processes and critical transitions including periods of unemployment, under-employment, and unpaid and informal work arrangements, are also encouraged. also, of interest is considering the role of work at the household level with influences on the health of partners and extended families, and the intergenerational transmission to children and their health. in addition, exploring the role of inequity-generating mechanisms that constrain choices around work and health such as racism and discrimination by sex, age, marital status, immigration status, social class, and other power structures is also encouraged.additionally, of interest are projects that explore whether work can explain the health or health care disparities seen within diseases or conditions (e.g., covid-19, opioid use disorder, mental/behavioral health, diabetes, cancer, heart disease, asthma, and maternal and infant health ) as well as disparities in co-morbidities and general indicators of health such as greater global burden of disease, quality of life, and daily functioning. projects that utilize a syndemics lens (i.e., multiple disease states that are interlinked because of social, environmental, and structural conditions), to examine the role of work in disparities in co-occurring health conditions, are encouraged.also, of interest are projects that explore how work contributes to health care disparities including but not limited to disparities in access to preventive, specialty, and emergency care, in health insurance coverage, and in quality of health care. moreover, given the reciprocal relationship between work and health, of interest are projects that examine how health impacts access to different work opportunities, working conditions, and work benefits, and how that varies by different social identities.projects may involve primary data collection and/or secondary analysis of existing datasets. projects may utilize observational studies, natural experiments, quasi-experiments, simulation modeling, as well as use of large-scale longitudinal data sets, data mining techniques, registries, surveillance data, and linking to administrative data sets such as the occupational information network (o*net). quantitative and mixed methods approaches are encouraged.investigators are encouraged as appropriate for the research questions posed, to forge research collaborations with community partners and stakeholders in the conceptualization, planning and implementation of the research to generate better-informed hypotheses and enhance the translation of the research results into practice.applications not responsive to the foanon-responsive applications will not be reviewed. applicants are strongly encouraged to reach out to the relevant scientific contacts to discuss whether their applications are responsive.areas of research interesteunice kennedy shriver national institute of child health and human development (nichd):nichd's mission is to lead research and training to understand human development, improve reproductive health, enhance the lives of children and adolescents, and optimize abilities for all. the nichd's broad and diverse research portfolio includes research related to conception and pregnancy; typical and atypical development in childhood; childhood trauma and critical illness; the transition from adolescence to adulthood; reproductive health; rehabilitation; intellectual, developmental, and physical disabilities; and population dynamics across the lifespan. for this par, nichd encourages research that integrates cross-cutting topics: health disparities, disease prevention, infectious disease, and nutrition. in response to par-21-275, topics of interest to nichd include, but are not limited to research on:national institute on minority health and health disparities (nimhd):nimhd is interested in studies that evaluate:national institute on aging (nia):the nia mission is to support and conduct genetic, biological, clinical, behavioral, social, and economic research on aging; foster the development of research and scientists in aging; provide research resources to facilitate innovative aging research; and disseminate information about aging and advances in research to the public, health care professionals, and the scientific community, among a variety of audiences. nia’s interest in this foa includes research to understand the influences employment, occupational factors, and voluntary/involuntary job loss on life course health and aging, including alzheimer’s disease and alzheimer’s disease related dementias (ad/adrd).specific areas of interest include, but are not limited to, research elucidating life course pathways via occupational circumstances leading to disparities in mid and later-life cognitive and health outcomes; the relationships between labor market change (e.g., growth/dissolution of occupations/industries, changes in certification/education requirements, etc.) and associated occupational exposures with health and disability at older age; the consequences of occupational and workplace policies (e.g. shift work, high-risk jobs, etc.) on health outcomes at older ages; experimental or quasi-experimental approaches using changes in workplace/labor policies from the national to the firm level (e.g., fair labor standards act, minimum wages, shift work regulations, unions, paid childcare/eldercare, etc.) to conduct causal analyses of work-related factors on health and cognition in mid- and later life; how hazardous job-related exposures across the work life (e.g., front-line or essential workers during the covid19 pandemic, high risk/stress occupations, etc.) are related to later life health and cognition; how timing and duration of job loss and retirement (e.g., disruption or completion of work history) influence health and cognition in later life; how occupation and occupation change over the life course influence health, well-being, and cognition (e.g., job qualities and benefits); how differences in social isolation or integration caused by occupational experiences serve as risk or protective for cognitive and health outcomes; how workplace accommodation influences disability and/or decline among persons with cognitive, sensory, or motor disabilities as they continue to age.applicants are encouraged to consult summaries of two recent nia-sponsored activities, including a series of teleconferences on work, the workplace, and aging and a recent national academies planning meeting on how workplace policies and qualities promote health and support work into older ages, for recent discussions of scientific challenges and opportunities related to these topics.note where appropriate in foa: nia requires all applicants planning to collect data provide plans to document and share all research data (see https://www.nia.nih.gov/research/data-sharing-resources-researchers). all projects should strive to employ common data elements/constructs and those developing new/innovative measures should employ approaches supporting crosswalks to common data elements/constructs.national institute on drug abuse (nida):nida is interested in research that explicates the mechanisms by which employment and drug use are related, in order to inform the future development and testing of interventions to directly address those mechanisms. nida encourages stakeholders and end users to be active partners in all stages of research so that findings have greater potential to directly influence practice. examples of nida interest areas include, but are not limited to:national institute of environmental health sciences (niehs):the mission of the niehs is to discover how the environment affects people to promote healthier lives. niehs has long recognized the harmful impacts of the physical work environment and other occupational exposures on human health. these workplace exposures disproportionately affect health disparity populations and are often an issue of environmental justice.niehs is interested in applications that focus on the intersection of work as a social determinant of health, the physical environment (that includes exposures to toxicants) and other social determinants of health in creating or intensifying environmental health disparities at the population level. community engaged research approaches are strongly encouraged as well as applications that move the science of environmental health disparities towards achieving environmental justice for affected populations. niehs encourages prospective applicants to review our 2018-2023 strategic plan; the niehs research to action program also provides examples of community engaged research grants focused on occupational exposures.national institute on mental health (nimh):nimh is interested in studies that examine:for research on the effectiveness of interventions or services, nimh requires a study design using an experimental therapeutics approach, in which clinical trials test intervention effects on mental health outcomes as well as elucidate the intervention’s mechanism(s) of action. clinical trials applications that do not adhere to the experimental therapeutics framework will be considered non-responsive to this foa. therefore, applications must specify intervention target/mechanism and assess whether intervention-induced changes in the target account for the hypothesized outcome. in the case of services interventions, targets/mechanisms might involve change in service-user, family and/or provider behavior, or in organizational/system-level factors to improve access, engagement, continuity, quality, equity, and/or value of services. studies adapting interventions for racial and ethnic minority populations (e.g., american indians/alaska natives, asian americans, blacks/african americans, hispanics/latinos, and native hawaiians and other pacific islanders), sexual and gender minorities, socioeconomically disadvantaged populations, and underserved rural populations should provide an empirical rationale for the adaptation/augmentation target and a clear hypothesis and plan to address the target mechanism by which the adapted intervention will enhance outcomes. see the support for clinical trials at nimh web page for additional information. nimh also encourages researchers to provide a data analytic plan that specifies how multi-level factors, effects and interactions, or outcomes will be conducted.see section viii. other information for award authorities and regulations.grant: a support mechanism providing money,
