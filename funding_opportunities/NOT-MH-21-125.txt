technologies from academic and other non-small business research sectors to the marketplace. small business concerns (sbcs) are encouraged to submit small business innovation research (sbir) and small business technology transfer (sttr) grant applications that propose to further develop, optimize, validate and scale such technologies for commercial dissemination. additionally, sbir and sttr applications supporting the development and commercialization of novel technologies that fit within the mission of the brain initiative are encouraged.backgroundthe brain initiative is aimed at revolutionizing our understanding of the human brain. by accelerating the development and application of innovative technologies, researchers will be able to produce a new dynamic picture of the brain that, for the first time, shows how individual cells and complex neural circuits interact in both time and space. it is expected that the application of these new tools and technologies will ultimately lead to new ways to identify, treat, cure, and even prevent brain disorders.nih is one of several federal agencies involved in the brain initiative. planning for the nih component of the brain initiative is guided by the long-term scientific plan, "brain 2025: a scientific vision," which details seven high-priority research areas and calls for a sustained federal commitment of $4.5 billion over 12 years. this nosi is based on the nih's careful consideration of the recommendations of the brain 2025 report and input from the nih brain multi-council working group and the advisory committee to the nih director brain initiative working group 2.0.nih encourages brain initiative applications from investigators who are underrepresented in the biomedical, behavioral, or clinical research workforce (see nsf data) and the most recent report on women, minorities, and persons with disabilities in science and engineering. such individuals include those from underrepresented racial and ethnic groups as well as individuals with disabilities.nih also encourages businesses to participate in the brain initiative. it is possible for companies to submit applications directly to brain initiative program announcements or to collaborate with academic researchers in joint submissions. small businesses should consider applying to one of the brain initiative small business funding opportunity announcements (foas).in addition to the national brain initiative, the nih continues to have a substantial annual investment in neuroscience research and in technology development, including through thesbir and sttr programs. potential applicants are strongly encouraged to contact scientific/program staff if they have any questions about the best foa for their research.objectivesthe brain initiative and other research sponsors have invested a significant amount of funds in the development of new technologies to study and understand the brain, from basic and clinical perspectives, through a variety of mechanisms. this investment has produced a large number of innovative neuroscience technologies. while these innovations are put to good use by their developers, non-commercial developers often lack the resources and product development training to make their technologies robust and easy to use by the broad neuroscience community. moreover, ongoing support to maintain and update technologies in non-commercial settings is difficult to obtain. consequently, the promise of these advanced technologies is often realized only by industry. the brain initiative 2.0: from cells to circuits, towards cures report highlights the need to further support the dissemination of innovative neuroscience technologies.this nosi is intended to alert sbcs and partnering institutions that there is a need to help move useful brain initiative-developed technologies and brain initiative-relevant technologies from non-commercial laboratories into the commercial marketplace. these translational projects can be submitted through the sbir and sttr programs.supported research and development will include further development, optimization, validation and scaling of technologies for commercial dissemination and will likely require close collaboration between the original developers of these technologies and sbcs. these partnerships may be accomplished in a number of ways, including the use of multiple program directors/principal investigators.brain priority areas were identified in the brain 2025 report; applications from sbcs that aim to commercialize technologies relating to these priority areas are encouraged:responsive areas of researchexamples of technologies responsive to this nosi are listed below. this list is non-exhaustive and meant to provide a representation of appropriate applications from sbcs that support or enable the goals of the brain initiative.applicants are strongly encouraged to consult program staff regarding the appropriateness of the planned application to the brain initiative’s mission, scientific areas of interests and programmatic priorities.awardees will be expected to participate in the nih i-corps program or the concept to clinic: commercializing innovation (c3i) program to help advance the commercial opportunity of the technology.application and submission informationthis notice applies to due dates on or after april 5, 2021 and subsequent receipt dates through january 6, 2024.submit applications for this initiative using one of the following funding opportunity announcements (foas) or any reissues of these announcement through the expiration date of this notice.all instructions in the sf424 (r&r) application guide and the funding opportunity announcement used for submission must be followed, with the following additions:applications nonresponsive to terms of this nosi will not be considered for the nosi initiative.scientific/research contact(s)margaret c. grabb, ph.d. national
