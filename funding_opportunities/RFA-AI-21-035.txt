opportunitysee section iii. 3. additional information on eligibility.the purpose of this funding opportunity announcement (foa) is to support exploratory research focused on developing innovative methods and algorithms in biomedical computing, informatics, and data science addressing priority needs across the infectious or immune-mediated disease research continuum aligned with the research mission of niaid. this includes infectious diseases, emerging infections, or immune-mediated diseases that include allergy, autoimmunity, or immune reactions associated with transplantation.as a part of the trans-niaid data science program, this r21 foa encourages applications focused on the development of novel computational, mathematical, and statistical algorithms and methods, including artificial intelligence and machine learning approaches, that can considerably improve acquisition, management, analysis, visualization, and dissemination of relevant data and/or knowledge. this contrasts with early-stage development (u01) and enhancement/sustainment (u24) efforts to generate these tools and resources that are supported by the companion foas.30 days prior to the application due dateall applications are due by 5:00 pm local time of applicant organization. all types of non-aids applications allowed for this funding opportunity announcement are due on the listed date(s).applicants are encouraged to apply early to allow adequate time to make any corrections to errors found in the application during the submission process by the due date.not applicableit is critical that applicants follow the instructions in the research (r) instructions in the sf424 (r&r) application guide, except where instructed to do otherwise (in this foa or in a notice from nih guide for grants and contracts).conformance to all requirements (both in the application guide and the foa) is required and strictly enforced. applicants must read and follow all application instructions in the application guide as well as any program-specific instructions noted in section iv. when the program-specific instructions deviate from those in the application guide, follow the program-specific instructions.applications that do not comply with these instructions may be delayed or not accepted for review.there are several options available to submit your application through grants.gov to nih and department of health and human services partners. you must use one of these submission options to access the application forms for this opportunity.purposethe purpose of this funding opportunity announcement (foa) is to support exploratory research focused on developing innovative methods and algorithms in biomedical computing, informatics, and data science addressing priority needs across the infectious or immune-mediated disease research continuum aligned with the research mission of niaid. this includes infectious diseases, emerging infections, or immune-mediated diseases that include allergy, autoimmunity, or immune reactions associated with transplantation.backgroundniaid's basic and clinical research projects are generating large, diverse and complex data sets, including genomics/omics data, clinical data, immune phenotyping assay data, and imaging data. similarly, the infectious and immune-mediated diseases research communities have become a data-intense enterprise. niaid recognizes that there is a critical need to transform these data into knowledge to better understand pathogen transmission and evolution, pathogen-host interactions, host immune response, infectious and immune-mediated disease pathogenesis, as well as to develop new and improved diagnostics, therapeutics, and vaccines. hence the need for findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (fair) software solutions that are innovative and sustainable.in response to these complex data requirements niaid is launching three trans-niaid initiatives (rfa-ai-21-035, rfa-ai-21-020, and rfa-ai-21-021) to support investigator-initiated informatics and data science researchers, driven by critical research needs in infectious or immune-mediated disease research. the objective is to expand niaid's commitment to promote informatics solutions and harness the power of data science to maximize the institute’s potential to accelerate discoveries in niaid’s research. the three companion foas will also provide new funding opportunities and demonstrate niaid’s commitment to informatics and data science research.the companion foas of the program include:these niaid data-science program foas aim to promote research-driven data science technology across the development lifecycle to address priority needs in immune-mediated and infectious disease research with a clear rationale for the needs of the technology proposed and their benefit to immune-mediated and infectious disease research through user feedback.specific research objectivesthis r21 foa will support applications focused on the development of novel computational, mathematical, and statistical algorithms and methods, including artificial intelligence and machine learning approaches, that can considerably improve acquisition, management, analysis, visualization, and dissemination of relevant data and/or knowledge in infectious or immune-mediated diseases. the proposed data science method or algorithm must be novel and benefit niaid's overall research mission.some examples of potential projects relevant to this foa include but are not limited to the following:applications proposing the following topic areas would be considered non-responsive to this foa and will be returned without review:note: this foa differs from the companion foas, u01 rfa-ai-21-020 and u24 rfa-ai-21-021, because it uses the r21 exploratory/developmental grant mechanism. projects with limited preliminary data (e.g., proof-of-concept only) and that are high risk and/or paradigm shifting are not suitable for an u01 or u24 mechanism but may be suitable for this r21 foa. the u01 and u24 foas will support more advanced projects including early-stage tool development from prototyping to hardening and adaptation (u01) to advanced projects and/or sustaining operations to improve the user experience and availability of existing, widely-adopted data science tools or software (u24).investigators planning to submit an application in response to this foa are encouraged to contact and discuss their proposed research/aims with the scientific/research contact listed in section vii in advance of the application receipt date.see section viii. other information for award authorities and regulations.grant: a support mechanism providing money, property,

or interventions? are the concepts, approaches or methodologies, instrumentation, or interventions novel to one field of research or novel in a broad sense? is a refinement, improvement, or new application of theoretical concepts, approaches or methodologies, instrumentation, or interventions proposed?specific for this foa:is there innovation either in the method/algorithm developed or in how the method/algorithm is taken from one field and applied in another? does the proposed research constitute a novel/innovative analytical method within the chosen topic area, a new direction for methods research within the chosen topic area, or a significant adaptation of prior methods? will the proposed method/algorithm offer new possibilities for immune-mediated or infectious disease research relative to those currently available?are the overall strategy, methodology, and analyses well-reasoned and appropriate to accomplish the specific aims of the project? have the investigators included plans to address weaknesses in the rigor of prior research that serves as the key support for the proposed project? have the investigators presented strategies to ensure a robust and unbiased approach, as appropriate for the work proposed? are potential problems, alternative strategies, and benchmarks for success presented? if the project is in the early stages of development, will the strategy establish feasibility and will particularly risky aspects be managed? have the investigators presented adequate plans to address relevant biological variables, such as sex, for studies in vertebrate animals or human subjects?if the project involves human subjects and/or nih-defined clinical research, are the plans to address 1) the protection of human subjects from research risks, and 2) inclusion (or exclusion) of individuals on the basis of sex/gender, race, and ethnicity, as well as the inclusion or exclusion of individuals of all ages (including children and older adults), justified in terms of the scientific goals and research strategy proposed?will the scientific environment in which the work will be done contribute to the probability of success? are the institutional support, equipment and other physical resources available to the investigators adequate for the project proposed? will the project benefit from unique features of the scientific environment, subject populations, or collaborative arrangements?as applicable for the project proposed, reviewers will evaluate the following additional items while determining scientific and technical merit, and in providing an overall impact score, but will not give separate scores for these items.data sharing planis the data sharing plan appropriate and adequate for the proposed project?specific for this foa:
