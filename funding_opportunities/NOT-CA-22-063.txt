institute of dental and craniofacial research (nidcr)the overall goal of this notice of special interest (nosi) is to promote mechanistic research aimed at better understanding the pathophysiology of immune-related adverse events (iraes). it is anticipated that the mechanistic research supported through this nosi will build the foundational knowledge which will ultimately lead to better strategies to predict, prevent and/or ameliorate toxicities that can arise as a consequence of current immunotherapeutic regimens, and improve treatment outcomes. the proposed research can be basic or translational but should be focused on revealing the mechanisms underlying iraes. single investigators and/or multidisciplinary teams with relevant expertise in the research area proposed and/or patient characterization and selection are encouraged to apply.backgroundcancer immunotherapies including checkpoint inhibitors, adoptive cell transfer, and other immune modulators have led to durable long-term survival in subgroups of adult and pediatric cancer patients. however, these therapies can also lead to a breach of balance between immunity and immunopathology, resulting in mild to severe inflammatory reactions or autoimmunity, some of which can be life-threatening. the specific manifestation of iraes varies due to the different immunotherapy modalities used; for example, immune checkpoint blockade therapies can lead to inflammation and damage to various organ sites; while car-t cell therapies can result in cytokine release syndrome (crs), immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (icans) and on-target, off-tumor toxicity. iraes occur in only a subgroup of patients, at different organ sites, either early or late in the course of the therapy. there is currently no clear understanding of the complexity and heterogeneity of iraes, nor ways to predict those patients who will go on to develop an irae in response to a given immunotherapy. furthermore, whether health disparities affect the trajectory or severity of any given irae is also an important issue, which has been scarcely investigated. given that there is clear evidence of health disparities in autoimmune diseases and cancer and that the biological and socioeconomic determinants are yet to be fully delineated, health disparities in iraes would be expected. the incidence and severity of iraes have been shown in some cases to correlate with overall patient response and survival following immune checkpoint blockade, suggesting that the anti-tumor and autoimmune responses share common underlying mechanisms. immune suppression can sometimes reverse these adverse events but can also compromise the anti-tumor activity of immunotherapy. as immunotherapy approaches are expanded and used in ever-more-effective combinations, controlling non-specific inflammation and tissue damage will be a critical goal for which a clear understanding of the immune mechanism of iraes is essential.research objectivesthis nosi calls for research proposals to investigate iraes. specifically, research is encouraged in understanding the mechanisms of immune and/or autoimmune pathways that could be applied to improving immunotherapeutic approaches while simultaneously eliminating or reducing the severity of inflammatory or autoimmune responses. a related area of interest is research designed to enhance the target specificity of immunotherapeutic reagents, to reduce or prevent adverse events. an additional area of interest is the identification of predictive immunophenotypes of cancer patients at risk for developing iraes. understanding the risk factors for developing iraes would better inform patient stratification at the start of therapy and lead to improved treatment outcomes. achieving the goals of this nosi should establish a deeper understanding of the origins and activation pathways leading to inflammatory or autoimmune adverse events that currently limit the use of various immunotherapy regimens in patients.studies focused on mechanisms of iraes for both adult and pediatric cancers are encouraged. research may include, but is not limited to:specific areas of research interest to ncispecific areas of research interest to nidcr: nidcr is interested in supporting basic and translational studies of immunotherapy-related adverse events that are relevant to the nidcr's mission and strategic plan:potential applicants are encouraged to speak with an nidcr program official to discuss the relevance of the proposed research topic(s).specific areas of research interest to niams: niams is interested in supporting basic and/or translational studies focused on:specific areas of research interest to niaid: niaid is interested in supporting basic and/or translational studies that focus on understanding mechanisms regulating immune tolerance and autoimmunity associated with iraes. examples of niaidâ€™s interests include the following types of research:responsivenessthis nosi calls for research projects to study the basic mechanism of iraes. clinical research directly related to treatment strategies and outcomes in patients is not responsive to this nosi.examples of projects not responsive to this nosi:application and submission informationapplicants must select the ic and associated foa to use for submission of
