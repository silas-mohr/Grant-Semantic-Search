section iii. 3. additional information on eligibility.this funding opportunity announcement (foa) establishes an accelerated review/award process to support research to understand health outcomes related to an unexpected and/or time-sensitive event (e.g., emergent environmental threat; pandemic; change in local, state, or national policy; natural disaster). applications in response to this foa must demonstrate that the research proposed is time-sensitive and must be initiated with minimum delay due to a limited window of opportunity to collect baseline data, answer key research questions, and/or prospectively evaluate a new policy or program. this foa is intended to support opportunities in which empirical study could only be available through expedited review and funding, necessitating a substantially shorter process than the typical nih grant review/award cycle. the time from submission to award is expected to occur within 4-5 months. however, administrative requirements and other unforeseen circumstances may delay issuance dates beyond that timeline.4 weeks prior to application due dateapplications will be accepted on a rolling basis, beginning november 1, 2022.all applications are due by 5:00 pm local time of applicant organization.applicants are encouraged to apply early to allow adequate time to make any corrections to errors found in the application during the submission process by the due date.not applicableapplications will be reviewed within 8 weeks.applications will be reviewed on an expedited basiswithin 4-6 months of applicationnot applicableit is critical that applicants follow the instructions in the research (r) instructions in the sf424 (r&r) application guide, except where instructed to do otherwise (in this foa or in a notice from nih guide for grants and contracts).conformance to all requirements (both in the application guide and the foa) is required and strictly enforced. applicants must read and follow all application instructions in the application guide as well as any program-specific instructions noted in section iv. when the program-specific instructions deviate from those in the application guide, follow the program-specific instructions.applications that do not comply with these instructions may be delayed or not accepted for review.there are several options available to submit your application through grants.gov to nih and department of health and human services partners. you must use one of these submission options to access the application forms for this opportunity.backgroundthis funding opportunity announcement (foa) establishes an accelerated review/award process to support novel behavioral and social science research (bssr) to understand health outcomes related to an unexpected and/or time-sensitive event. applications in response to this foa must demonstrate that the research proposed is time-sensitive and must be initiated with minimum delay due to a limited window of opportunity to collect baseline data, answer key research questions, and/or prospectively evaluate a new policy or program that will likely impact health-related behavior or health outcomes in a given population. in other words, the urgency of the public health problem being studied will not, on its own, be sufficient justification for time sensitivity.research scopethis foa is intended to support research and data collection for unanticipated real-world events (i.e., those that occur outside of a laboratory or other controlled setting for research purposes). these “events” inherently have limited windows of opportunity for planning and conducting rigorous research and data collection. it is critical that researchers maximize these learning opportunities to better inform health care and public health efforts, as well as policymakers.key definitions for this foa:this foa encourages partnerships and collaboration between researchers and the impacted community, which may include the following types of entities (as appropriate): community-based organizations, local and state governments, private or non-profit organizations, behavioral health or health care systems, individual health care providers, departments of health, community health clinics, juvenile or criminal justice settings, schools, child welfare systems, etc.the distinguishing features of a responsive study are:(1) the unpredictable and unanticipated nature of the research opportunity.(2) the clear scientific value and feasibility of the study.(3) a feasible plan for collection of baseline data and primary data collection (although use of existing data is allowed, a plan for collecting important and new data rapidly should be provided).(4) a justification for why an expedited review and funding (substantially shorter than the typical nih grant review/award cycle) are required in order for the scientific question(s) to be addressed and the research design to be implemented. expected study methodologies may include, but are not limited to, interrupted time-series, difference-in-difference designs, regression discontinuity, or propensity scoring.in situations where applications under this foa focus on a particular locality (region, community, or other defined geographic area), note that findings should have the potential to be generalizable beyond the particular locality or population. proposed studies should demonstrate the ability to inform the understanding of the impact of the event, policy, program or infrastructure change in the near-term. applicants are encouraged to include secondary implementation related outcomes that could inform interpretation of outcomes for future researchers and decision-makers, such as unintended consequences or barriers and facilitators associated with implementation.applicants are also encouraged to review the nih-led efforts that recommend research strategies for ensuring study rigor and reducing bias, such as including an appropriate comparison group where possible: nih pathways to prevention (p2p) workshop: method for evaluating natural experiments in obesity. furthermore, attention should be paid to ongoing developments in strengthening causal inference from evaluation of these “natural experiments” or observational study designs. considerable progress has been made on this topic in public health, econometrics, and diverse aspects of policy research.structurethis foa will utilize a bi-phasic, milestone-driven r61/r33 mechanism, consisting of a r61 phase with developmental activities and a r33 phase with expanded activities designed to achieve the full research aims. the r61 phase will be up to one year, and will support developmental, exploratory research, institutional review board approval for human subjects protection, further development of study partnerships, and the collection of baseline data. the r33 phase will build on this initial work for up to four years to include further development, application, follow-up data collection, or implementation as appropriate and relevant to the proposed research questions.the application should articulate clear aims and objectives for each phase of the proposed research, with specific discussion of how results from the r61 phase will inform the r33 phase. in addition, applications must delineate explicit milestones for the r61 and r33 phases. a milestone is defined as a scheduled event in the project timeline that indicates completion of a project stage or activity. it is expected that baseline data collection will be conducted within six months of award, which should be included in the applicant’s submission of a project timeline and milestones. at the completion of the r61 phase, the program director (pd)/principal investigator (pi) will submit a report that includes the progress on each of the milestones and a clear description of how research during the r33 phase will be impacted by attainment of the r61 milestones. the ic program and other relevant staff will review the report and make recommendations on funding of the r33 grant based on two independent factors: 1) the preliminary research results and achievement of the milestones and 2) availability of funds and program priorities, irrespective of milestone achievements. transition to the r33 phase is neither automatic nor guaranteed. funding for the r33 phase is subject to availability of funds and program priorities, independent of milestone achievement. in addition, given the possibility for changes in policy or program implementation that are beyond the control of the grantee, grant awards may be terminated early if these changes limit the possibility to collect meaningful outcome data.additional guidancewhile applicants may propose to investigate time-sensitive opportunities outside the u.s., they must demonstrate within the application that all the proper logistics, human subjects concerns, and approvals, both domestic and international, can be addressed within the limited time frame outlined in this announcement. in addition, the applicant must demonstrate how information obtained from this study will have direct implications for us practice or policy.applicants are strongly encouraged to contact the relevant scientific contact(s) listed below to discuss whether their application would likely be responsive based on time-sensitivity four (4) weeks in advance of planned application.applications not responsive to this foathe following types of applications are not responsive to this foa. applications not responsive to this foa will not be reviewed.all responsive applications to this foa will be subject to an accelerated review and award process. it is intended that eligible applications selected for funding will be awarded within 4-5 months of the application due date. however, administrative requirements and other unforeseen circumstances may delay issuance dates beyond that timeline.specific areas of research interestnational cancer institute (nci)nci supports time-sensitive evaluation of programs, policies, and major

to lead scientific research to improve minority health and reduce health disparities. nimhd focuses on all aspects of health and health care for racial and ethnic minority populations in the u.s. and the full continuum of health disparity causes as well as the interrelation of these causes. nimhd projects must include a focus on one or more of the following populations that nih-designates as experiencing health disparities in the united states and its territories: african americans, latinos/hispanics, american indians and alaska natives, asian americans, native hawaiians and other pacific islanders, less privileged socioeconomic groups, underserved rural populations, and sexual and gender minorities. comparison groups/populations may also be included as appropriate for the research questions posed. nimhd encourages research projects that use approaches encompassing multiple domains of influence (e.g., biological, behavioral, sociocultural, environmental, physical environment, health system) and multiple levels of influence (e.g., individual, interpersonal, family, peer group, community, societal) to understand and address health disparities (see the nimhd research framework, https://www.nimhd.nih.gov/about/overview/research-framework.html, for more information). studies based outside the u.s. or its territories will not be supported by nimhd under this foa.

assessment of the likelihood for the project to exert a sustained, powerful influence on the research field(s) involved, in consideration of the following review criteria and additional review criteria (as applicable for the project proposed).scored review criteriareviewers will consider each of the review criteria below in the determination of scientific merit and give a separate score for each. an application does not need to be strong in all categories to be judged likely to have major scientific impact. for example, a project that by its nature is not innovative may be essential to advance a field.significancedoes the project address an important problem or a critical barrier to progress in the field? is the prior research that serves as the key support for the proposed project rigorous? if the aims of the project are achieved, how will scientific knowledge, technical capability, and/or clinical practice be improved? how will successful completion of the aims change the concepts, methods, technologies, treatments, services, or preventative interventions that drive this field?investigator(s)are the pd(s)/pi(s), collaborators, and other researchers well suited to the project? if early stage investigators or those in the early stages of independent careers, do they have appropriate experience and training? if established, have they demonstrated an ongoing record of accomplishments that have advanced their field(s)? if the project is collaborative or multi-pd/pi, do the investigators have complementary and integrated expertise; are their leadership approach, governance, and organizational structure appropriate for the project?innovationdoes the application challenge and seek to shift current research or clinical practice paradigms by utilizing novel theoretical concepts, approaches or methodologies, instrumentation, or interventions? are the concepts, approaches or methodologies, instrumentation, or interventions novel to one field of research or novel in a broad sense? is a refinement, improvement, or new application of theoretical concepts, approaches or methodologies, instrumentation, or interventions proposed?approachare the overall strategy, methodology, and analyses well-reasoned and appropriate to accomplish the specific aims of the project? have the investigators included plans to address weaknesses in the rigor of prior research that serves as the key support for the proposed project? have the investigators presented strategies to ensure a robust and unbiased approach, as appropriate for the work proposed? are potential problems, alternative strategies, and benchmarks for success presented? if the project is in the early stages of development, will the strategy establish feasibility and will particularly risky aspects be managed? have the investigators presented adequate plans to address relevant biological variables, such as sex, for studies in vertebrate animals or human subjects?if the project involves human subjects and/or nih-defined clinical research, are the plans to address 1) the protection of human subjects from research risks, and 2) inclusion (or exclusion) of individuals on the basis of sex/gender, race, and ethnicity, as well as the inclusion or exclusion of individuals of all ages (including children and older adults), justified in terms of the scientific goals and research strategy proposed?milestones and timeline: is there a unifying research question that transcends both r61 and r33 phases? does the application provide well described, feasible and quantifiable milestones for the r61 phase and related scientific goals and objectives for the r33 phase? are those milestones conducive to accomplishing the study aims? are the goals of the r33 phase based, in part, on findings collected during the r61 phase? does the timeline demonstrate baseline data collection within six months of award?environmentwill the scientific environment in which the work will be done contribute to the probability of success? are the institutional support, equipment, and other physical resources available to the investigators adequate for the project proposed? will the project benefit from unique features of the scientific environment, subject populations, or collaborative arrangements?if applicable and proposing to investigate time-sensitive opportunities outside the u.s., is there appropriate justification of how the information obtained from the study will have direct implications for us practice and/or policy? is there adequate information provided demonstrating that all the proper logistics, human subjects concerns, and approvals, both domestic and international, can be addressed within the limited time frame outlined in this announcement.additional review criteriaas applicable for the project proposed, reviewers will evaluate the following additional items while determining scientific and technical merit, and in providing an overall impact score, but will not give separate scores for these items.protections for human subjectsfor research that involves human subjects but does not involve one of the categories of research that are exempt under 45 cfr part 46, the committee will evaluate the justification for involvement of human subjects and the proposed protections from research risk relating to their participation according to the following five review criteria: 1) risk to subjects, 2) adequacy of protection against risks, 3) potential benefits to the subjects and others, 4) importance of the knowledge to be gained, and 5) data and safety monitoring for clinical trials.for research that involves human subjects and meets the criteria for one or more of the categories of research that are exempt under 45 cfr part 46, the committee will evaluate: 1) the justification for the exemption, 2) human subjects involvement and characteristics, and 3) sources of materials. for additional information on review of the human subjects section, please refer to the guidelines for the review of human subjects.inclusion of women, minorities, and individuals across the lifespanwhen the proposed project involves human subjects and/or nih-defined clinical research, the committee will evaluate the proposed plans for the inclusion (or exclusion) of individuals on the basis of sex/gender, race, and ethnicity, as well as the inclusion (or exclusion) of individuals of all ages (including children and older adults) to determine if it is justified in terms of the scientific goals and research strategy proposed. for additional information on review of the inclusion section, please refer to the guidelines for the review of inclusion in clinical research.vertebrate animalsthe committee will evaluate the involvement of live vertebrate animals as part of the scientific assessment according to the following criteria: (1) description of proposed procedures involving animals, including species, strains, ages, sex, and total number to be used; (2) justifications for the use of animals versus alternative models and for the appropriateness of the species proposed; (3) interventions to minimize discomfort, distress, pain and injury; and (4) justification for euthanasia method if not consistent with the avma guidelines for the euthanasia of animals. reviewers will assess the use of chimpanzees as they would any other application proposing the use of vertebrate animals. for additional information on review of the vertebrate animals section, please refer to
