institutes/centers. the following nih offices may co-fund applications assigned to those institutes/centers.office of behavioral and social sciences research (obssr)office of research on women's health (orwh)the purpose of this nosi is to solicit projects on preventive interventions that address cardiometabolic risk factors in populations that experience health disparities.key definitionspopulations that experience health disparities: populations defined in section 464z-3(d)(1) of the public health service act, 42 u.s.c. 285t(d)(1) as “health disparity populations” based on higher overall rates of disease incidence, prevalence, morbidity, mortality, or survival rates in the population as compared to the health status of the general population. nih-designated u.s. health disparity populations currently include blacks/african americans, hispanics/latinos, american indians/alaska natives, asian americans, native hawaiians and other pacific islanders, socioeconomically disadvantaged populations, underserved rural populations, and sexual and gender minorities.preventive intervention: for the purposes of this nosi, preventive interventions include interventions for both primary and secondary prevention. as defined by the cdc (https://www.cdc.gov/pictureofamerica/pdfs/picture_of_america_prevention.pdf), primary prevention involves intervening before health conditions occur by altering risk factors through behavioral, social, environmental, or policy changes. secondary prevention involves identification of health conditions before the onset of signs and symptoms through screening and intervening to reduce the risk of disease progression.cardiometabolic risk factors: for this nosi, cardiometabolic risk factors are defined as factors associated with the circulatory, endocrine, immune and digestive systems that increase risk for cardiovascular disease and other chronic health conditions. cardiometabolic risk factors associated with the leading causes of death and disability include hypertension, hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia, albuminuria, high body mass index, low levels of physical activity, and dietary risks. preventive services to address these risk factors include screening for obesity, high blood pressure, abnormal blood glucose, and cholesterol, as well as behavioral or other preventive interventions to improve nutrition, physical activity, blood pressure, blood insulin and/or glucose, and weight or body composition.level of influence: for this nosi, levels of influence are the socio-ecological levels (e.g., individual, interpersonal, organizational, community, or societal) at which specific determinants operate to influence risk factors and subsequent health outcomes (see the nimhd research framework, https://www.nimhd.nih.gov/about/overview/research-framework.html, for examples of health determinants at different levels of influence). to constitute an intervention at the interpersonal, organizational, community, or societal level, the intervention must directly alter determinants at that level, not just be delivered in a setting at that level or help individuals manage the consequences of determinants at that level. for example, an intervention to promote better nutrition among school-aged children by adjusting available food options in the school cafeterias would be an organizational-level intervention; an intervention providing nutrition information to students within the schools would be an individual-level intervention. a multi-level intervention is an intervention that impacts determinants at two or more socio-ecological levels.backgroundthe nih office of disease prevention is coordinating the new trans-nih research effort, advance: advancing prevention research for health equity, which grew out of the odp’s portfolio analysis of nih research. in an examination of nih-funded grants and cooperative agreements between fiscal years 2012 and 2017, the odp found that only 8.5% of all projects focused on preventing the leading risk factors or causes of death and disability (e.g., poor nutrition, low physical activity, smoking), falling well below their burden on the nation’s health. an additional analysis of the nih research portfolio showed that between fiscal years 2016 and 2019, only 3.6% of nih-funded prevention projects included a randomized intervention to address a leading risk factor in populations that experience health disparities.this nosi focuses specifically on preventive interventions addressing cardiometabolic risk factors across the lifespan in populations that experience health disparities. efforts to improve these risk factors should be based on research that identifies and addresses relevant determinants of health at individual, interpersonal, organizational, community, and societal levels. as part of proposed prevention interventions, investigators should work in collaboration with appropriate community, service system, and/or healthcare partners to develop and evaluate interventions that are relevant, acceptable, and sustainable in community and service settings.proposed projects must include an intervention that addresses at least one cardiometabolic risk factor, alone or in combination with other types of risk factors (e.g., smoking, occupational risks), in one or more populations that experience health disparities.study designs are encouraged to include the following features:applications not responsive to the foanon-responsive applications will not be reviewed. applicants are strongly encouraged to reach out to the relevant scientific contacts to discuss whether their applications are responsive.specific areas of research interestnational cancer institute (nci)the national cancer institute (nci) is interested in interventions that address behavioral risk factors for cancer in populations that experience health disparities.these include many behaviors that also increase cardiometabolic risk, such as smoking, obesity, poor diets, and lack of physical activity. since these risk factors often cluster together, nci is particularly interested in interventions that address multiple behavioral risk factors (e.g., smoking and obesity; poor diets and sedentary lifestyles) and that operate at multiple levels (e.g., individual, family, community, built environment, policy) to address these risk factors in populations experiencing health disparities.additional areas of interest include, but are not limited to, interventions that propose to:nci

(e.g., targeting diet, physical activity, sedentary behavior, sleep, smoking, etc.) in nih-designated populations that experience health disparities with a focus on the mechanism of action of the intervention.nhlbi will only accept applications in response to pa-20-183 or the subsequent reissued equivalent:activity codefoafirst available application due dater01pa-20-183 - research project grant (parent r01 clinical trial required)october 5, 2022for pa-20-183, only mechanistic clinical trials will be accepted in accordance with not-hl-19-690. applicants wishing to propose non-mechanistic clinical trials (i.e., efficacy, effectiveness, feasibility, acceptability, and implementation) through separate foas with specific requirements may consider applying to one of the nhlbi clinical trial mechanisms described at https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/grants-and-training/clinical-trial-development-continuum and referencing this nosi in a cover letter.potential nhlbi applicants requesting $500,000 or more in direct costs in any year (excluding consortium f&a) must consult nhlbi program staff and submit a letter of request to the nhlbi prior to submitting any applications, and follow the procedures of the nhlbi implementation of the nih policy on the acceptance for review of unsolicited applications that request $500,000 or more in direct costs as described in the sf424 (r&r) application guide.investigators planning to submit an application in response to this nosi are strongly encouraged to contact and discuss their proposed research/aims and appropriateness for the r01 mechanism with an nhlbi program officer listed on this nosi well in advance of the receipt date.national institute on alcohol abuse and alcoholism (niaaa)alcohol misuse is not only linked to increased risk of cardiovascular disease and other chronic conditions but also associated with cardiometabolic risk factors that are the focus of this nosi. drinking too much alcohol can raise blood pressure and negatively influence glucose metabolism. drinking levels and patterns have been correlated with diet quality and body weight gain. combined heavy alcohol consumption, poor diet, and sedentary lifestyle can increase the risk of negative health outcomes. the 2020–2025 dietary guidelines for americans recommends against anyone initiating alcohol consumption for any reason. if adults of legal drinking age choose to drink, the guidelines recommends that they should drink in moderation: up to one standard drink per drinking day for women and up to two for men. binge drinking should be avoided.niaaa is interested in research that aligns with overlapping priorities of this nosi and the niaaa strategic plan and addresses the unique health needs of the understudied populations that experience health disparities. research areas of interest include but are not limited to:please see not-aa-22-011 or the subsequent revised notice for information about niaaa data-sharing guidance for

optional)october 5, 2022national institute of dental and craniofacial research (nidcr)prevention is the first line of defense against cardiometabolic and other chronic diseases and their complications. many metabolic risk factors are shared between multiple systemic and dental, oral, and craniofacial diseases. prevention and detection of these risk factors may limit the physical, mental, and socio-economic burden associated with disease onset and progression, resulting in more easily controllable and potentially reversible diseases. thus, it is essential to ensure that adequate screening opportunities are available and benefit all segments of the population, particularly the most vulnerable individuals.expanding screening opportunities to all population subgroups may involve diversifying the types of settings where screenings are offered or offering multiple screening opportunities within the same setting. cross-cutting partnerships, such as robust medical-dental and community partnerships, increase opportunities to expand cardiometabolic risk factors screening to populations subgroups with limited screening opportunities or elevated disease risk.cardiometabolic risk factors screenings are routinely performed in conjunction with dental, oral and craniofacial screenings or procedures, although these screening activities are selective, may not always follow uniform approaches or best practices, and are aimed primarily at ensuring short-term patient safety, often with incomplete or inconsistent follow-up and medical referral for diagnostic confirmation and specialized care.areas of interest include, but are not limited to, interventions that:nidcr will only accept applications submitted through these foas or their subsequent

environmental health sciences (niehs)the mission of the national institute of environmental health sciences (niehs) is to discover how the environment affects people to promote healthier lives. examples of environmental exposures relevant to the mission of the niehs include, but are not limited to, industrial chemicals or manufacturing byproducts, e-waste, metals, pesticides, herbicides, and inhaled toxicants including indoor air pollutants from cooking and other sources. for this announcement, the niehs is interested in supporting research investigating intervention strategies to reduce environmentally induced cardiometabolic disorders and diseases.areas of interest include, but are not limited to:niehs will only accept applications submitted through these foas or their subsequent

of this foa.national institute on minority health and health disparities (nimhd)nimhd is interested in supporting innovative, multidisciplinary, and collaborative interventions considering determinants from more than one domain or level of influence (see nimhd research framework).research must focus on one or more populations that experience health disparities (see definition above). interventions may occur within the context of health care and/or community settings and focus on any age group. multi-sectoral approaches (e.g., interventions involving housing, labor, education, or other sectors in addition to health care and public health) are of interest. research projects must aim at attaining optimal multi-cardiometabolic risk factor control goals (based on recommended guidelines of prevention and care), and not just on mere improvement. innovative and transformative adaptation of research strategies that are congruent with or effectively adapt to the population(s) of interest’s sociocultural and socioeconomic contexts and that promote agency, are a priority. demonstration of sustainability and affordability of these interventions is also a priority.specific

neurological disorders and stroke (ninds)the ninds is interested in applications within the ninds mission (ninds disorders index: https://www.ninds.nih.gov/health-information/disorders). research areas include, but are not limited to: projects proposing to test, adapt, or examine new strategies to implement evidence-based interventions that prevent or reduce cardiometabolic risk factors (i.e. high blood pressure, high body mass index, dietary risks, and low levels of physical activity) associated with stroke and other cerebrovascular diseases, alzheimer’s disease and related dementia, vascular cognitive impairment, epilepsy, migraine, nervous system infections, spinal cord injury, headache, parkinson's disease, and other neurodegenerative disorders, brain trauma, and neurodevelopmental disorders. the ninds supports intervention research focused on identifying, monitoring, and targeting biological, environmental, social, community, structural, and healthcare system factors that lead to, or are associated with, disparities (or inequities) in neurological diseases and care across the lifespan. this announcement encourages health equity and sdoh theory-driven proposals that test conceptual frameworks, leverage care-settings that serve populations that experience health disparities, and address the needs of multiple stakeholders. applicants are encouraged to incorporate community engagement strategies into their study designs.examples of ninds relevant cardiometabolic risks factors of interest:examples of proposed prevention projects include, but are
