institute of mental health (nimh)purposethis notice calls for research on understanding and addressing gaps in the hiv care continuum.in the united states and globally, ambitious goals have been targeted for hiv testing, adherence, and retention in care, and viral suppression to optimize hiv clinical outcomes and preventive benefit. in each step of the hiv care continuum, there have been significant advances to optimize the likelihood of viral suppression for men, women, and children living with hiv. for example, innovative approaches have been developed to increase rates of hiv testing, such as the use of social networks, technology-based approaches, hiv self-test distribution, community mobilization, and the implementation of hiv testing access in non-medical settings. for adherence to hiv medication regimens, significant investment and advances have been made to develop and implement objective measures of hiv medication use and a range of efficacious treatment adherence interventions. these interventions to increase adherence to regimens have been successfully implemented in the us and international settings. however, more work is needed, as indicated below. progress has also been made in the development and testing of interventions designed to sustain retention in hiv care and treatment over longer periods of time. this target in the hiv care continuum has gained increased attention and import in recent years, due to the advances in hiv treatment and care that have made hiv a disease that can now be considered a chronic disease that requires lifelong treatment. relative to the range of efficacious approaches to optimally target and intervene to increase rates of hiv testing and adherence to hiv treatments, the evidence base is much smaller for efficacious interventions to prevent patients dropping from hiv treatment and promoting sustained retention in hiv care. similarly, there is a dearth of proven interventions available to locate and re-engage persons who dropped from hiv care and treatment and who are not currently receiving hiv treatment, as well as those without durable viral suppression.current evidence indicates that if 95% of all persons living with hiv know their status, 95% of those diagnosed receive antiretroviral treatment (art), and 95% of those on treatment achieve sustained viral suppression, then incident hiv infections will decline, and an end to the hiv/aids pandemic is achievable. in some settings, there is evidence that with necessary resources, a comprehensive strategy, and effective approaches for hiv testing, linkage to care, adherence support, and retention in care, these “95-95-95” targets are feasible. e u.s. ending the hiv epidemic and pepfar 3.0 strategy underscores the importance of doing the “right things, in the right places” to curb the epidemic.substantial challenges remain, however. additional tools are needed to inform the gaps and strategies that are unique to specific populations, cities, regions, and countries – to enable the scale-up of services that will achieve epidemic control. studies are encouraged that examine multi-level factors that can optimize care continuum success, including individual, contextual, and structural. applications appropriate for this notice could include formative basic behavioral and social science to better understand a step in the care continuum and/or multiple steps in the hiv care continuum, initial development and pilot tests of innovative approaches for intervention, and intervention efficacy trials and implementation science.an important aspect of this will be collaborations between the scientific and service entities in communities. research teams are strongly encouraged to have academic and department of health (doh) or ministry of health (moh) partnerships for the research applications, in order to optimize the match of the research directions with local needs, and to optimize the public health impact of the research implementation and findings. this notice also encourages researchers to utilize a developmental perspective that addresses the substantial changes that occur across the lifespan (from infancy through older adulthood) that are associated with hiv treatment challenges. additionally, given the complexity of advancing hiv care research, multidisciplinary and modeling approaches are encouraged that draw appropriately from multiple disciplines to reach solutions based on novel understandings of these complex problems.areas of research interestareas of programmatic interest include, but are not limited to:it is strongly recommended that applicants review the nimh division of aids research current funding opportunity announcements (available on our website at https://www.nimh.nih.gov/about/organization/dar/aids-related-funding-opportunity-announcements-foas.shtml), and consult with a program officer before application submission.the nimh has published updated policies and guidance for investigators regarding human research protection and clinical research data and safety monitoring (not-mh-15-025). the application’s protection of human subjects section and data and safety monitoring plans should reflect the policies and guidance in this notice. plans for the protection of research subjects and data and safety monitoring will be reviewed by the nimh for consistency with nimh and nih policies and federal regulations.application and submission informationthis notice applies to due dates on or after may 7, 2020 and subsequent receipt dates through may 7, 2023.submit applications for this initiative using one of the following funding opportunity announcements (foas) or any reissues of these announcement through the
