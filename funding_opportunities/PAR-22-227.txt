september 22 and september 30, 2022see section iii. 3. additional information on eligibility.this funding opportunity announcement (foa) invites applications to the national institute on aging's (nia) research and entrepreneurial development immersion (redi): mentored entrepreneurial career development award program. the purpose of the program is to provide support and protected time (three to five years) for an intensive, supervised career development experience in the biomedical, behavioral, or clinical sciences leading to research independence. the program is designed to support participants' transition to research independence in a multitude of career options, including research and teaching faculty, as well as entrepreneurial, industry, science policy, and research administration positions. optimal candidates for this opportunity are experienced postdoctoral researchers (two years minimum) and/or recently appointed junior faculty members (usually with ph.d. degrees) in biomedical, social, or behavioral sciences who are interested in entrepreneurial training and are pursuing careers in research areas supported by nia.this k01 foa includes entrepreneurial training and career development opportunities for early-career academic scientists as part of its translational research and supervised career development activities.this foa is designed specifically for candidates proposing research that does not involve leading an independent clinical trial, a clinical trial feasibility study, or an ancillary clinical trial. under this foa, candidates are permitted to propose a research experience in a clinical trial led by a mentor or co-mentor.not applicableall applications are due by 5:00 pm local time of applicant organization.applications are encouraged to apply early to allow adequate time to make any corrections to errors found in the application during the submission process by the due date.not applicableit is critical that applicants follow the instructions in the career development (k) instructions in the sf424 (r&r) application guide, except where instructed to do otherwise (in this foa or in a notice from the nih guide for grants and contracts). conformance to all requirements (both in the application guide and the foa) is required and strictly enforced. applicants must read and follow all application instructions in the application guide as well as any program-specific instructions noted in section iv. when the program-specific instructions deviate from those in the application guide, follow the program-specific instructions. applications that do not comply with these instructions may be delayed or not accepted for review.there are several options available to submit your application through grants.gov to nih and department of health and human services partners. you must use one of these submission options to access the application forms for this opportunity.the overall goal of the nih research career development program is to help ensure that a diverse pool of highly trained scientists is available in appropriate scientific disciplines to address the nation's biomedical, behavioral, and clinical research needs. nih institutes and centers (ics) support a variety of mentored and non-mentored career development award programs designed to foster the transition of new investigators to research independence and to support established investigators in achieving specific objectives. candidates should review the different career development (k) award programs to determine the best program to support their goals. more information about career programs may be found at the nih extramural training mechanisms website.the objective of the nih mentored research scientist development award (k01) is to provide salary and research support for a sustained period of “protected time” (3-5 years) for intensive research career development, under the guidance of an experienced mentor, or sponsor in the biomedical, behavioral or clinical sciences leading to research independence. the expectation is that, through this sustained period of research career development and training, recipients will launch independent research careers and become competitive for new research project grant (e.g., r01) funding.the objective of this funding opportunity announcement (foa) is to provide entrepreneurial development support, salary, and research support for a sustained period of “protected time” for intensive research career development, under the guidance of an experienced mentor or sponsor in the biomedical, behavioral, or clinical sciences, leading to independence. unlike candidates funded through the parent k01 foa, it is expected that candidates funded through this foa may pursue careers other than academic research, including, but not limited to, research careers in industry and scientific business development, including small business development activities and the future submission of nih small business grant applications.background and needwhile the number of ph.d. graduates has rapidly increased in recent years, the number of available tenure-track faculty positions has remained stagnant. this imbalance has created a highly competitive job environment, making it increasingly difficult for ph.d. graduates to transition to academic appointments.doctoral and post-doctoral training programs have heavily revolved around developing skill sets that are directly relevant to academic research activities that mentors deem important, such as the ability to publish rapidly and secure research funding. given that most of the available nih training programs and fellowship opportunities are in place to train scientists for an academic career, these trainees may then lack the soft skills and the know-how to transition to other scientific positions. also, modern academic positions have evolved to often include roles that are focused on translational research and teamwork with multidisciplinary teams. these roles are optimally suited for individuals with a broad skillset and understanding of the cross-sector landscape.university research fosters a substantial portion of industrial research and development (r&d) in the biotech industry, and university spinoffs employ high-tech talents, generate taxes, and act as economic hotbeds for the local economy. also, spin-offs frequently catalyze the formation of technology-focused geographic clusters. the biotech community has been essential in catalyzing academic discoveries and commercializing them into needed solutions that improve public health. this is especially true for neurodegenerative diseases and aging-based research, where there are substantial unmet needs and the opportunities for product development are rapidly expanding.given their scientific acumen, postdoctoral scientists have emerged as vital stakeholders in the spinoff generation process. the crucial role that postdocs play in the formation of spinoffs is mainly due to three factors: the accelerated rise of early-stage biotech investing, the rapid expansion of biotech incubators, and the increase in the number of postdoctoral researchers with diminishing academic job prospects. since new biotech and medical tech companies require skilled researchers, providing postdoctoral researchers with entrepreneurial and related career development support will broaden their career options and provide industry stakeholders access to new workforce talent. therefore, supplementing the canonical postdoctoral experience with training in entrepreneurship, business development, scientific communications, and scientific policy can provide both the scientific acumen and business skillset to turn an idea with translational potential into a successful startup enterprise. this training experience is designed to empower and enhance the employability and value offered by early-career scientists beyond academia.purposeto boost the number of university startups in the field of aging, and to facilitate various career opportunities for early- career scientists, nia seeks applications from candidates proposing a varied set of experiential learning activities geared towards gaining a broad set of skills and knowledge required of translational scientists and entrepreneurs. this skills and knowledge base includes scientific communications, an understanding of the intellectual property process and landscape, regulatory and reimbursement pathway knowledge, the ability to identify unmet needs within markets and define value propositions, and a clear understanding of the biomedical development path, financing sources, and challenges. the selected candidates should receive structured career development experiences wherein translational aging research is combined with entrepreneurial communications, and/or policy training. the experimental research is expected to be supplemented with participation in entrepreneurial training and business development course-based and experiential learning programs (including relevant certificate programs, mentoring programs, etc.), external seminars, invited lectures, and networking with industry. the research development program of the candidate should be based on the candidate's scholastic background, previous research experience, and past achievements. interest in translational research and commercialization should be an important consideration.this foa supports key areas that represent the mission of nia, including alzheimer's disease (ad) and ad-related dementias (adrd). applications pertaining to ad/adrd are encouraged. for details on the key divisions of nia, visit nia's research divisions webpage.optimal candidates for this opportunity are experienced postdoctoral researchers (two years minimum) and/or recently appointed junior faculty members (usually with ph.d. degrees) in biomedical, social, or behavioral sciences who are interested in entrepreneurial training and are pursuing careers in research areas supported by nia. all postdoctoral researchers and junior faculty from diverse backgrounds are encouraged to apply, including individuals from groups underrepresented in the u.s. biomedical, clinical, and behavioral sciences research enterprise, which includes individuals from underrepresented racial and ethnic groups, individuals with disabilities, and individuals from disadvantaged backgrounds (see: notice of nih's interest in diversity, not-od-20-031).prospective applicants are strongly encouraged to contact the scientific/research contact, provided in section vii. agency contacts, early in the application preparation phase to discuss the application.non-responsiveness criteriathe following types of applications will be considered non-responsive to this foa, and will be withdrawn prior to review:see section viii. other information for award authorities and regulations.grant: a support mechanism providing money, property, or both to an eligible entity to carry out an approved project or activity.not allowed: only accepting applications that do not propose clinical trials.note: applicants may propose to gain experience in a clinical trial led by a mentor/co-mentor as part of their research career development.the number of awards is contingent upon nia appropriations and the number of meritorious applications submitted.the total project period may not exceed 5 years. given the emphasis on entrepreneurial training, we encourage applications that propose a shorter project period.nih will contribute up to $90,000 per year toward the salary of the career award recipient. further guidance on budgeting for career development salaries is provided in the sf424 (r&r) application guide. see also not-od-17-094.the total nih contribution to salary, however, may not exceed the legislatively mandated salary cap. see here.nih will contribute $50,000 per year toward the research and career development costs of the award recipient, which must be justified and consistent with the stage of development of the candidate and the proportion of time to be spent in research or career development activities. these funds may be used for the following expenses: (a) tuition and fees related to career development; (b) research-related expenses, such as supplies, equipment and technical personnel; (c) travel to research meetings or training; and (d) statistical services including personnel and computer time. applicants are encouraged to allocate between 20-50% of these funds to support their participation in entrepreneurial and other relevant training programs. these entrepreneurial and training programs may be broad in nature with the goal of imparting education in translation of the academic research. courses that will augment the entrepreneurial training are allowed.salary for mentors, secretarial and administrative assistants, etc. is not allowed.1. eligible applicantshigher education institutionsthe following types of higher education institutions are always encouraged to apply for nih support as public or private institutions

eligible, as do pd/pis of transition scholar (k38) awards and individuals appointed to institutional k programs (k12, kl2). candidates for the k01 award must have a research or health-professional doctoral degree.2. cost sharing3. additional information on eligibilityapplicant organizations may submit more than one application, provided that each application is scientifically distinct, and each is from a different candidate.the nih will not accept duplicate or highly overlapping applications under review at the same time per 2.3.7.4 submission of resubmission application. an individual may not have two or more competing nih career development applications pending review concurrently. in addition, nih will not accept:candidates may submit research project grant (rpg) applications concurrently with the k application. however, any concurrent rpg application may not have substantial scientific and/or budgetary overlap with the career award application. k award recipients are encouraged to obtain funding from nih or other federal sources either as a pd/pi on a competing research grant award or cooperative agreement, or as project leader on a competing multi-project award as described in not-od-08-065.at the time of award, the candidate must have a “full-time” appointment at the academic institution. candidates are required to commit a minimum of 75% of full-time professional effort (i.e., a minimum of 9 person-months) to their program of career development. candidates may engage in other duties as part of the remaining 25% of their full-time professional effort not covered by this award, as long as such duties do not interfere with or detract from the proposed career development program.candidates who have va appointments may not consider part of the va effort toward satisfying the full time requirement at the applicant institution. candidates with va appointments should contact the staff person in the relevant institute or center prior to preparing an application to discuss their eligibility.after the receipt of the award, adjustments to the required level of effort may be made in certain circumstances. see not-od-18-156 and nih grants policy statement, section 12.3.6.4 temporary adjustments to the percent effort requirement for more details.mentor(s)one primary criterion of this foa is mentorship. to be competitive, applications must identify two mentors – a research mentor (rm) and an entrepreneurial mentor (em). the two mentors will work synergistically to ensure the successful completion of the project, both from the research and entrepreneurial training points of view. in doing so, the mentors will also equip the pd/pi with key technical and business acumen. both mentors must provide a letter of support highlighting their commitment to the project as well as the mentee (pd/pi). the rm is expected to be the head of an academic laboratory, preferably from the trainee's institution. as a key opinion leader in the research field, the rm should guide the pd/pi in scientific and technical matters. the em needs to be experienced in the area of focus through the proposed non-research training, such as entrepreneurship and scientific communications or policy. applicants are encouraged to propose ems outside of the trainee's institution, or at least outside the trainee's department, and the proposed em should have experience mentoring candidates for a breadth of career options, including research, policy, communications, and budsiness development careers. other mentors or mentoring teams that may provide additional focal points of guidance may be included by the applicant.applicants are encouraged to consider mentors from local and regional accelerators and hubs.the applicant institution must have a strong, well-established record of research and career development activities and faculty qualified to serve as mentors in biomedical, behavioral, or clinical research.1. requesting an
