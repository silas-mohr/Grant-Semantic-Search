december 13, 2021pa-20-185 - nih research project grant (parent r01 clinical trial not allowed) pa-20-195 - nih exploratory/developmental research grant program (parent r21 clinical trial not allowed)national institute of allergy and infectious diseases (niaid)the purpose of this notice of special interest (nosi) is to support research that contributes to the areas of interest outlined in “a universal influenza vaccine: the strategic plan for the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases.” the proposed research should have clear relevance to the research objectives defined in the strategic plan, which encompasses three major research areas:backgroundwhile vaccines remain the greatest public health tool to protect against influenza illness and disease, the effectiveness of seasonal influenza vaccine remains suboptimal, ranging between 10% and 60%. circulating viral strains are difficult to predict and the co-circulation of antigenically drifted strains can potentially lead to vaccine mismatches, lowering overall vaccine effectiveness each season. in addition, viral strains with pandemic potential continue to be isolated from avian species, further underscoring the on-going global threat of influenza to public health. to limit the public health consequences of both seasonal and pandemic influenza, vaccines with broader, more durable protection are needed. niaid continues to identify efforts for the full implementation of the 2018 strategic plan for the development of a universal influenza vaccine.recent advances in influenza virology, immunology, and vaccinology make the development of a “universal” influenza vaccine more feasible than a decade ago, and new technological advances resulting from the ongoing covid-19 pandemic response efforts have revolutionized vaccine development. by tapping new and growing technological advances, the field is poised to make significant scientific advancements that will enable the development of more broadly protective influenza vaccines.research objectivesthe purpose of this nosi is to continue to foster new and innovative scientific endeavors in all areas defined in the strategic plan for the development of a universal influenza vaccine. specific areas of research interest include, but are not limited to:application and submission informationthis notice applies to application receipt dates on or after february 5, 2022 and subsequent receipt dates through january 7, 2025.submit applications for this initiative using one of the following funding opportunity announcements (foas) or any reissues of these announcements through the expiration date of this notice.all instructions in the sf424 (r&r) application guide and the funding opportunity announcement used for submission must be followed, with the following additions:for funding consideration, applicants must include “not-ai-22-013” (without quotation marks) in the agency routing identifier field (box 4b) of the sf424 r&r form. applications without this information in box 4b will not be considered for this initiative.applications nonresponsive to terms of this nosi will not be considered for the nosi initiative.scientific/research contact(s)jennifer l. gordon, ph.d. national institute of allergy and infectious diseases (niaid) division of microbiology and infectious diseases telephone: 301-761-6805 email: jennifer.gordon2@nih.govkentner singleton, ph.d. national institute of allergy and infectious diseases (niaid) division of allergy, immunology, and transplantation telephone: 240-669-5499 email: kentner.singleton@nih.govfinancial/grants management contact(s)vandhana khurana national institute of allergy and infectious diseases (niaid) telephone: 240-669-2966 email: khuranav@niaid.nih.govweekly toc for this announcement nih funding opportunities and noticesnote: for help accessing pdf, rtf, ms word, excel, powerpoint, audio or video files, see help downloading files.
