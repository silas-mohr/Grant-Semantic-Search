(sgmro)division of program coordination, planning and strategic initiatives, office of disease prevention (odp)office of research on women's health (orwh)the purpose of this notice is to highlight interest in research to improve understanding of the determinants of firearm injury, the identification of those at risk of firearm injury (including self- and other-directed, victims and perpetrators, accidental injury), the development, piloting, and testing of innovative interventions to prevent firearm injury and mortality, and the examination of approaches to improve the implementation of existing, evidence-based interventions to prevent firearm injury and mortality.backgroundviolence is defined by the world health organization as: “the intentional use of physical force or power, threatened or actual, against oneself, another person, or against a group or community, that either results in or has a high likelihood of resulting in injury, death, psychological harm, maldevelopment, or deprivation.” violence affects people of all ages, and its impact is far-reaching. violent victimization events are associated with not only physical injury or mortality, but also a range of acute and chronic physical and behavioral health conditions, such as obesity, cardiovascular disease, asthma, substance use disorders, depression and anxiety, sleep disturbance, impairments in cognitive development and executive functioning, and adverse birth outcomes. findings from prior research suggest that indirect (witnessing) exposures to violence have adverse effects on behavioral and physical health that are similar to the effects of direct exposures.the national institutes of health (nih) is committed to understanding effective public health interventions to prevent violence, including firearm violence, and the trauma, injuries, and mortality resulting from violence. the department of health and human services (hhs) is committed to improving the health and well-being of the nation through healthy people 2030 (hp2030). hp2030 establishes targets for national health objectives and monitors and catalyzes progress over time to measure the impact of research and prevention efforts. both injury prevention and violence prevention are identified as priority areas in hp2030.in addition to physical injury, chronic health impacts, and potential mortality, witnessing or experiencing violent victimization increases the risk of acute and chronic mental and behavioral health conditions. when firearms are involved with violent events (including suicide, intimate partner violence, child or elder maltreatment, youth and gang related violence, sexual assault, and hate crimes), the risk for injury and mortality increases. in 2020, 79% of all homicides and 53% of all suicides involved firearms. from 2019 to 2020, the firearm homicide rate increased about 35%, to its highest recorded rate in over 25 years. in addition, the firearm suicide rate remained consistently high from 2019 to 2020 with increases in some populations. as such, in 2020, firearm-related injuries became the leading cause of injury death for children and youth ages 1-19. the increase in firearm-related deaths from 2019-2020 further widened disparities by race, ethnicity and poverty. for example, firearm homicides among black individuals increased by 39% and firearm suicide rate increased by 42% among american indian and alaska native persons.research objectivesresearch encouraged by this nosi is consistent with a broad public health approach to firearm injury and mortality prevention including:in addition to interventions delivered by healthcare providers and systems, this nosi encourages research delivered in community settings, and that integrates individual, family, interpersonal, community, and structural or system (e.g., criminal or juvenile justice, child welfare, drug courts) approaches to firearm injury and mortality prevention. thus, development of cross-sector partnerships and/or integration across disparate databases may be necessary.this nosi is comprehensive in its consideration of risk for victimization and/or perpetration across the lifespan and across sexual and gender identities, people with developmental disabilities or cognitive impairments (e.g., alzheimer’s disease and its related dementias), comorbid conditions (e.g., psychiatric or substance use disorders), or other at-risk populations such as pregnant and post-partum individuals, justice/legal system involved individuals, veterans, and members of the military. in addition, consideration of nih designated health disparity populations (who are often disproportionately impacted by firearm injury and mortality), is encouraged: specifically, blacks/african americans, hispanics/latinos, american indians/alaska natives, asian americans, native hawaiians and other pacific islanders, socioeconomically disadvantaged populations, underserved rural populations, and sexual and gender minorities. please refer to specific bullets below to obtain information about priority populations for each participating institute, center, or office.nih is committed to supporting research to enhance diversity, equity, inclusion and accessibility (deia) in biomedical and behavioral sciences research. applicants are encouraged to discuss how they will foster these principles in their proposed research activities.priority research topics within the scope of this foa that could use the deia framework may include but are not limited to:eunice kennedy shriver institute of child health and human development (nichd)the nichd supports research aimed at advancing the science of trauma and injury prevention and care for pediatric populations, with the goal of reducing the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in children. the institute encourages research projects to develop new methods, interventions, and measurement tools to improve clinical outcomes in children who have been exposed to violence and other traumatic events.. for this nosi, the nichd is interested in research on the epidemiology of violence and inflicted and unintentional injuries as it relates to the use of firearms. research projects may include but not be limited to studies that address:national center for complementary and integrative health (nccih)nccih is interested in supporting research on the development and testing of theoretically-grounded programs to prevent firearm injury and mortality that incorporate complementary or integrative approaches with physical and/or psychological therapeutic inputs, (often called mind and body interventions). nccih will also support dissemination and implementation research of evidenced based interventions that include mind and body components and that have proven efficacious for prevention of firearm injury and prevention. mind and body interventions include various mind-based approaches (e.g., mindfulness, hypnosis, guided imagery), body-based approaches (e.g., spinal manipulation, massage, mobilization, acupuncture), meditative movement approaches (e.g., yoga, tai chi, qi-gong), music and art therapy approaches, or a combination of these approaches (e.g., meditation and yoga, or mindfulness-based stress reduction mbsr).for more details on nccih’s approach to funding clinical trials, including a description of our available foa’s, please see https://nccih.nih.gov/grants/funding/clinicaltrials. nccih will not accept applications to the parent r01 or r21 in response to this nosi.national institute of mental health (nimh)nimh encourages research focused on reducing suicide risk through preventive, therapeutic, and services interventions that focus on responsible storage and lethal means safety. applicants interested in learning more about nimh priorities on research on aggression and violence against others are encouraged to view this published notice of special of interest.if adequate preliminary data does not exist, investigators are encouraged to conduct pilot effectiveness trials to evaluate the feasibility, tolerability, acceptability and safety and preliminary effectiveness of approaches to improve clinical outcomes, to modify risk factors, or to improve service delivery, and for obtaining the preliminary data needed as a pre-requisite to a larger-scale effectiveness trial (e.g., comparative effectiveness study, pragmatic trial).examples of relevant research topics include but are not limited to:nimh encourages projects testing the effectiveness of preventive, therapeutic, or services interventions that are designed as hybrid effectiveness-implementation trials, as appropriate, depending on the level of pre-existing effectiveness evidence and implementation readiness. thus, in addition to testing the effectiveness of a preventive or therapeutic intervention, nimh encourages effectiveness trials that are designed to assess and examine consumer-, provider- and setting- level factors that might be associated with implementation fidelity (i.e., as hybrid type-i trials) or to simultaneously test strategies to promote successful implementation (i.e., as hybrid type ii trials). likewise, studies that are primarily aimed at testing an implementation or dissemination strategy should be designed to also assess the outcomes and effectiveness of the intervention/approach that is being implemented, as appropriate and feasible (i.e., as hybrid type iii trials).nimh support for clinical trials research follows an experimental therapeutics approach, whereby clinical trials are designed, not only to test the intervention effects on outcomes of interest, but also to inform understanding of the intervention’s mechanisms of action. as such, applications that propose to develop and/or test the efficacy/effectiveness of preventive, therapeutic or services interventions must include specification of the intervention target(s)/mechanism(s) and assessment of intervention-induced changes in the presumed target mechanism(s) that are hypothesized to account for the intervention outcome. see the support for clinical trials at nimh web page for additional information regarding dedicated foas for nimh clinical trials. please note that nimh does not accept clinical trials/interventional studies in response to the nih parent foas.national institute of nursing research (ninr)the national institute of nursing research (ninr) supports research to solve pressing health challenges and inform practice and policy - optimizing health and advancing health equity into the future. ninr discovers solutions to health challenges through the lenses of health equity, social determinants of health, population and community health, prevention and health promotion, and systems and models of care. drawing on the strengths of nursing's holistic, contextualized perspective, core values, and broad reach, ninr funds multilevel and cross-sectoral research that examines the factors that impact health across the many settings in which nurses practice, including homes, schools, workplaces, clinics, justice settings, and the community. observational, intervention, and implementation research are of interest to ninr.national institute on aging (nia)nia welcomes basic behavioral, psychological, social, and economic research focused on causes and consequences of direct (as a victim or perpetrator) and indirect (as a witness) exposure to firearm violence and injury and research to develop and test interventions aimed at middle-aged and older adults for the treatment and prevention of firearm injury and mortality in the context of homicide, intimate partner violence, elder mistreatment, and suicide. nia is especially interested in research that examines and addresses health disparities and health equity in nia-designated priority populations, as specified in the nia health disparities research framework, and gender-based-violence. nia encourages projects that include assessments of housing and living conditions, household composition, sexual orientation and gender identity, and health and disability status. firearm injury and prevention studies related to alzheimer's disease-related dementias (ad/adrd) are particularly welcome.nia is interested in supporting integrated care interventions that develop clinical and community linkages or leverage and build on existing programs which are designed in accordance with the nih stage model. to this end, nia solicits projects focused on: intervention development, refinement, modification, and adaptation and pilot testing (stage i); traditional efficacy testing (stage ii); and efficacy testing with real-world providers (stage iii). applications proposing to adapt existing interventions are expected to provide evidence to support the need for tailored strategies. all applications are expected to include a management plan for mitigating bias in the detection and measurement of firearm violence exposure.priority areas of interest to nia include, but are not limited to:national institute on alcohol abuse and alcoholism (niaaa)the national institute on alcohol abuse and alcoholism (niaaa; https://www.niaaa.nih.gov/) supports research projects focused on the epidemiology, prevention, and treatment of alcohol-related violence. the use and misuse of alcohol often is a factor in various forms of other- and self-directed violence, including intimate partner violence, dating violence, elder abuse, child maltreatment, bullying, sexual assault, homicide, and suicide, forms of violence that often involve use of a firearm. fruitful research investigations may be conducted in the human laboratory or in the field. proposed interventions may focus on the perpetrators of the violence, the victims, and/or potential bystanders.national institute on drug abuse (nida)nida is interested in a wide variety of research that examines connections between substance use and firearms violence, particularly firearm-related research that has implications for the prevention or treatment of substance use. possible areas of research include, but are not limited to:national institute on minority health and health disparities (nimhd)the mission of nimhd is to lead scientific research to improve minority health and reduce health disparities. populations that experience health disparities include african americans/blacks, hispanic/latinos, american indians/alaska natives, asians, native hawaiians, and other pacific islanders, socioeconomically disadvantaged populations, underserved rural populations, and sexual and gender minority (sgm) populations. nimhd is especially interested in the innovative application of community-engaged research approaches and utilization of the nimhd research framework to address the continuum of firearm injury and mortality prevention efforts among populations that experience health disparities and individuals with intersecting health disparity population membership, across multiple levels of influence (i.e., individual, community, societal).the office of
