thus, most external fetal monitoring requires a cable that runs from the patient to a bedside machine. this substantially reduces the mobility of a laboring person. importantly, limited mobility is a considerable shortcoming in the current management of labor, as freedom of movement is associated with decreased pain, improved quality of uterine contractions, expedited fetal descent, and improved maternal-fetal oxygenation. new technology that allows for freedom of movement would be an important improvement in current clinical practice.furthermore, although continuous labor support is an intervention known to improve maternal outcomes, cctg has resulted in altered care processes that reduce the amount of labor support provided by staff; the focus in the birthing room becomes the technology, not the laboring person. the use of cctg places a time burden on staff as well, as it is challenging to monitor some patients, particularly in cases of obesity, early gestational age, and multiple gestations. nurses report adjusting the fetal monitor, on average, 15 times in a 12-hour shift, typically spending more than 1 hour per shift adjusting the monitor. many birthing people also find the abdominal bands that hold the cctg in place and the frequent adjustments to be uncomfortable and intrusive. new technology will need to be unobtrusive and accurate across body type, gestational age, and gestation number to address these issues.research objectivesthe objectives of this nosi are to advance the accuracy and useability of fetal assessment technology, ultimately resulting in improved maternal and neonatal outcomes and an enhanced birth experience. this initiative also seeks to build on the growing and advancing field of non-invasive physiologic monitoring and sensor technology. recent innovations have led to the development of multiple new non-invasive monitoring techniques, including technologies that measure blood ph based on exhaled breath, non-invasive monitors of blood pressure, pulse, and ph based on impedance measurement, optical measurement of hemoglobin and oxygen saturation, and microwave technology for non-invasive measurement of blood components, to name only a few. the unique differences between maternal and fetal physiology could allow for these non-invasive technologies to be adapted to the maternal-fetal dyad, leading to more accurate assessment of fetal status during labor.this nosi encourages research and development of technologies that include, but are not limited to, technologies that:application and submission informationthis notice applies to due dates on or after february 5, 2022 and subsequent receipt dates through may 8, 2024.submit applications for this initiative using one of the following funding opportunity announcements (foas) or any reissues of these announcement through the expiration date of this notice.all instructions in the sf424 (r&r) application guide and the funding opportunity announcement used for submission must be followed, with the following additions:applications nonresponsive to terms of this nosi will not be considered for the nosi initiative.scientific/research contact(s)monica longo, md, phdeunice kennedy shriver national institute of child health and human development (nichd) telephone: 240-204-4605 email: monica.longo@nih.govweekly toc for this announcement nih funding opportunities and noticesnote: for help accessing pdf, rtf, ms word, excel, powerpoint, audio or video files, see help downloading files.
