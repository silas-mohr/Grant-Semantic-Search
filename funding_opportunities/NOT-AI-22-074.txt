october 3, 2022pa-20-185 – nih research project grant (parent r01 clinical trial not allowed)pa-20-195 – nih exploratory/developmental research grant program (parent r21 clinical trial not allowed)national institute of allergy and infectious diseases (niaid)this notice of special interest (nosi) invites applications to stimulate multidisciplinary research to better understand pathogen/vector interactions to identify approaches to prevent pathogen transmission to the vertebrate host.backgroundvector-borne diseases account for 17% of all infectious diseases world-wide causing more than 700,000 deaths annually. arthropod vectors transmit viruses, bacteria, parasites, and nematodes to humans resulting in high morbidity and mortality rates in endemic countries. interventions to control some of these diseases have focused on the human host (e.g., therapeutics, vaccines) or the insect host (e.g., insecticides). although these approaches have had some impact, these measures have not achieved sufficient levels of control to prevent and/or eliminate transmission of these diseases. there is a need to develop novel approaches that are effective, environmentally safe, and do not promote the development of resistance. examples of novel approaches include, but are not limited to:successful approaches that target the pathogen within the arthropod vector could be used in combination with therapeutics, vaccines and traditional vector control interventions as a multipronged approach to control and eliminate the transmission of vector-borne pathogens.advancements in understanding pathogen/vector interactions are paramount to identifying and exploiting approaches that inhibit transmission of vector-borne diseases. establishing multidisciplinary collaborations across vector, pathogen, and/or associated fields is an opportunity to advance the science.research objectivesareas of interest include, but are not limited to:application and submission informationthis notice applies to due dates on or after february 5, 2023 and subsequent receipt dates through january 7, 2026.submit applications for this initiative using one of the following funding opportunity announcements (foas) or any reissues of these announcement through the expiration date of this notice.all instructions in the sf424 (r&r) application guide and the funding opportunity announcement used for submission must be followed, with the following additions:applications nonresponsive to terms of this nosi will not be considered for the nosi initiative.scientific/research contact(s)adriana costero-saint denis, ph.d. national institute of allergy and infectious diseases (niaid) telephone: 240-292-4184 email: acostero@niaid.nih.govweekly toc for this announcement nih funding opportunities and noticesnote: for help accessing pdf, rtf, ms word, excel, powerpoint, audio or video files, see help downloading files.
