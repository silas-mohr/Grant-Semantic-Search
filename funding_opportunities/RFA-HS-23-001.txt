award information section iii. eligibility information section iv. application and submission information section v. application review information section vi. award administration information section vii. agency contacts section viii. other informationthe agency for healthcare research and quality (ahrq) and the patient-centered outcomes research institute (pcori) seek applications for learning health system embedded scientist training and research (lhs e-star) centers (p30) grant to support institutions to train the next cadre of embedded learning health system (lhs) scientists who have the skills to conduct, apply, and implement patient-centered outcomes research (pcor) a type of comparative clinical effectiveness research (cer). cer compares the effectiveness of two or more interventions or approaches to health care, examining their risks and benefits. pcor compares two or more medical treatments, services, or health practices and addresses questions and outcomes important to patients and other healthcare stakeholders, through studies that engage, and generate evidence meaningful to, those who need this information to make health and healthcare decisions. the goal of the notice of funding opportunity (nofo) is to train embedded health system scientists and to conduct pcor/cer to improve health system operations, quality, and health outcomes. 42 u.s.c. 299b-37 authorizes ahrq to establish a grant program that provides for the training of researchers in the methods used to conduct pcor/cer and to support the agency's dissemination of comparative clinical effectiveness research findings. consistent with 42 u.s.c. 299b-37(e), grants funded under this program will train clinical and research scientists to have the skills to support and lead efforts to apply pcor/cer methods and conduct pcor/cer in a lhs and to facilitate rapid implementation of evidence that will improve quality of care and patient outcomes.ahrq defines a learning health system (lhs) as a health system in which internal data and experience are systematically integrated with external evidence, and that knowledge is put into practice (https://www.ahrq.gov/learning-health-systems/about.html). the goal of these systems is for patients to receive higher quality, safer, and more efficient care, and health care delivery organizations become better places to work. in a learning health system model, both institutional and clinical practice partners are actively engaged and participate in the generation, adoption, and application of evidence. a lhs scientist is an individual who is embedded within a health system and collaborates with its stakeholders to produce novel insights and evidence that can be rapidly implemented to improve the outcomes of individuals, populations, and health system performance.in 2018, ahrq and pcori funded 11 institutions to support the training of embedded researchers to conduct pcor/cer within lhs, producing embedded lhs scientists. a core component of the lhs training programs was the implementation of ahrq-developed core competencies (see https://www.ahrq.gov/learning-health-systems/building-workforce.html) for training pcor/cer professionals to become lhs scientists.this ahrq/pcori p30 lhs e-star program nofo builds on lessons learned from the ahrq/pcori lhs k12 program (https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/rfa-files/rfa-hs-17-012.html) to support the professional development of scientists to conduct research that accelerates progress toward an integrated learning health system. successful applicants to the ahrq/pcori p30 lhs e-star program nofo will build new models of lhs infrastructure that: strengthen institutional research training in cer and pcor; enhance diversity in the lhs research workforce; strengthen partnerships with community partners and health system and other stakeholders; and conduct pcor/cer projects to improve health system operations, quality, and health outcomes.this funding opportunity is open to all eligible applicants.ahrq and pcori invite applications from qualified institutions to create learning health system embedded scientist training and research (lhs e-star) centers that support the professional development of scientists to conduct research that accelerates progress towards an integrated learning health system and build a critical and sustainable lhs research workforce. grants will be funded under the p30 research program projects and centers grant mechanism, which supports center core grants that fund a multidisciplinary approach to shared resources and facilities for research and training by investigators from different disciplines who focus on a common research problem. programs are expected to prepare clinician and research scientists for independent research careers in pcor/cer and equip scientists to advance the field through their training and scholarship as the next generation of learning health system scientists. in addition, the lhs e-star program supports pcor/cer and the dissemination, implementation, and use of research findings.the nofo objectives are to:this program will establish lhs e-star centers that focus on the application and mastery of the core lhs scientist competencies (see https://www.ahrq.gov/learning-health-systems/building-workforce.html) to support the professional development of scientists to conduct research that accelerates progress towards an integrated learning health system. the lhs e-star centers will build new models of lhs infrastructure that support and enhance existing institutional training and research infrastructure. this program will be structured to support training and pcor/cer organized around shared resources and research infrastructure within each of the lhs e-star centers. in this model, centers will be able to use and pool knowledge of mentors to develop the didactic curriculum and learn from one another as they share their experiences in helping scientists to navigate their way through successful lhs projects. this approach will produce a cadre of lhs scientists, lhs mentors, and rapid learning projects that can accelerate advances in knowledge, health system performance, and patient outcomes.the benefit of supporting multiple institutions is that it broadens the pool of potential expertise beyond what is typically available at a single institution. because the aim of the lhs model is to learn through rapid testing and iteration to ultimately scale research that engages health system, community partners, and others, the program will support learning among diverse sites and partners. this approach will contribute to more rapid growth in the number and diversity of individuals, as well as organizations, capable of successfully working at the interface of clinical operations, informatics and pcor/cer.applications to this nofo from academic institutions must have a track record of excellence in training clinical and research scientists. qualified, established training institutions must demonstrate a commitment to partner with healthcare delivery systems. applications from healthcare delivery systems should have a track record of excellence in training researchers and conducting system-based research aimed at improving clinical treatment, health outcomes, quality, and/or health care delivery. non-academic health systems may apply but would be expected to partner with an academic institution in providing formal, educational training needs. both academic institution and system-based applicants must describe prior and planned collaborative relationships in their applications.participating in pcornet®, the national patient-centered clinical research network, is not a requirement but use of pcornet® is strongly encouraged as a resource to support lhs research.all applicants will be expected to recruit and train lhs scientists from beyond their own institution (for example, who are affiliated with other health systems or institutions, including pcornet-participating sites), in order to provide experiential research opportunities for lhs scientists at a variety of institutions. to ensure a broad reach for didactic and experiential training applicants are encouraged to partner with diverse organizations such as safety net and community organizations and federally qualified health centers. all applicants must demonstrate mentoring support from all partners, including research and health care delivery operational leaders.each application must:have a focus on supporting the professional development of scientists to conduct embedded research that accelerates progress towards an integrated learning health system. new models of lhs infrastructure that support pcor/cer should:have a training focus:facilitate collaboration:conduct program evaluation:applicants are encouraged to consider research activities that use pcornet to conduct lhs research. collaborating with pcornet is one strategy to advance understanding and use of the nationally representative network, which can be used to conduct a range of study designs supporting learning health systems. pcornet resources can facilitate collaboration between researchers, patient communities, clinicians, and health systems in research partnerships that leverage large volumes of health data while also ensuring that research focuses on the questions and outcomes that matter most to patients and those who care for them. for more information, applicants are encouraged to contact the pcornet front door (https://pcornet.org/front-door/).applicants must identify the career levels for which the proposed research education program is planned and describe the intended embedded scientists and the eligibility criteria and/or specific educational background characteristics that are essential for participation in the proposed research education program. embedded scientists to be supported by the program must be at the career level for which the planned program is intended and appointed for no more than three-year period.each lhs e-star center should be organized around a series of core activities related to the center's infrastructure-building and mentoring goals. the cores should be organized to provide intellectual leadership and innovation; facilitate and develop novel pcor/cer strategies; conduct community-level engagement; stimulate incorporation of emerging technologies, methods, and scientific advances into research designs as appropriate; and provide mentoring for future leaders in lhs research from diverse backgrounds.centers are expected to create a structure that integrates activities across the site’s cores to support scientific and educational advancement. a minimum of three cores is required: each application must include an administrative core (ac), a research education core (rec), and research and data analysis core (rdac). the ac will provide leadership and governance for the lhs e-star center and ensures that the program activities remain within the center's scientific area of focus. the goal of the rec is to provide a mentoring mechanism leading to enduring careers in lhs research for lhs scientists. individuals targeted for mentoring relationships may include clinician or research scientists. the rdac will create, identify, catalogue, and disseminate scientific information produced by pcor/cer projects conducted by the center with a specific focus on ahrq and pcori priorities. applicants should refer to section iv.2 of this announcement for specific instructions on requirements for each of the cores.requirements: administrative core (required core)the administrative core (ac) will provide leadership for the lhs e-star center, with a focus on training program administration. the lhs e-star centers should have strong and experienced central leadership with an administrative core (ac) directed by the pd/pi(s). the pd/pi(s) should be recognized leaders in lhs embedded pcor/cer and training and should be experienced in successfully mentoring investigators from diverse backgrounds and in supporting engagement with community and stakeholder partners in the context of lhs. the ac will coordinate proposed activities and maintain internal information flow. the ac is responsible for managing and coordinating interactions among the pd/pi(s), the core leaders, lhs scientists, mentors of pilot projects, other researchers at the applicant institution as well as partner institutions, stakeholders, other ahrq/pcori-funded programs, appropriate institutional administrative personnel, the staff of the awarding agency, and the members of the community in which the center is located.key responsibilities of the administrative core include:requirements: research education core (required)the goal of the research education core (rec) is to produce lhs embedded scientists and enhance diversity in the lhs workforce by: supporting pcor/cer research projects for lhs scientists relevant to ahrq/pcori priorities; providing continuing mentoring activity for lhs scientists to achieve research career training objectives; offering education in lhs research using ahrq-sponsored lhs training competencies or specific enhancements to those competencies the program will deploy, with justification; and providing activities and resources to the lhs scientists throughout their training program affiliation. individuals participating in mentoring relationships may include clinician or research scientists working in academic and health system or stakeholder partner organizations. it is the responsibility of the rec to assure successful mentoring of, and collaboration with, lhs scientists from diverse backgrounds.required rec activities include:a strong and high-quality infrastructure to support a combination of didactic and experiential training – including mentorship and learning opportunities provided within both academic and lhs settings allowing for the application and mastery of the knowledge and skills outlined across the lhs scientist core competencies. the entire program should be designed to rigorously monitor and provide a well-defined structure that promotes the development of professional skills and research productivity for all embedded scientists.rec activities must be:recs must promote pcor/cer research that:requirements:

limitations specified above for this nofo. application processing may be delayed or the application may be rejected if it does not comply with these requirements.ahrq is committed to the inclusion of priority populations in health services research. the overall portfolio of health services research that ahrq conducts and supports shall include the populations specifically named in ahrq’s authorizing legislation: inner city; rural; low income; minority; women; children; elderly; and those with special health care needs, including those who have disabilities, need chronic care, or need end-of-life health care. 42 u.s.c. 299(c)(1). ahrq also includes in its definition of priority populations those groups identified in section 2(a) of executive order 13985 as members of underserved communities: black, latino, and indigenous and native american persons, asian americans and pacific islanders and other persons of color; members of religious minorities; lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (lgbtq+) persons; persons with disabilities; persons who live in rural areas; and persons otherwise adversely affected by persistent poverty or inequality.ahrq will broadly implement this inclusion policy across the research that ahrq supports and conducts so that the portfolio of research is inclusive of all populations. ahrq intends that these populations be included in studies such that the research design explicitly allows conduct of valid analyses. the policy applies to all grant applications. investigators should review the document entitled, “ahrq policy on the inclusion of priority populations,” which is available at https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/not-hs-21-015.html. applicants under this nofo must consider and discuss including priority populations in research design as specified in this notice.investigators should review the document titled ‘ahrq announces new policy for public access to ahrq-funded scientific publications’, which is available at (http://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/not-hs-16-008.html). for all research arising from ahrq support, this policy requires that ahrq-funded authors submit an electronic version of the author’s final peer-reviewed accepted manuscript to the national library of medicine's pubmed central (pmc) to be made publicly available within 12 months of the publisher’s date of publication.investigators should review the document titled ahrq data management plan (dmp) policy, which is available at (https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/not-hs-20-011.html). this policy requires applicants for ahrq new/competing grants and research contracts to include a dmp for managing, storing and disseminating the primary data, samples, physical collections, and other supporting materials created or gathered in the course of research funded by ahrq, or state why data management is not possible, as a component of their grant application or research contract proposal.the precise content of the data-sharing plan will vary, depending on the data being collected and how the investigator is planning to share the data. applicants who are planning to share data should describe briefly the expected schedule for data sharing; the format of the final dataset; the documentation to be provided; whether or not any analytic tools also will be provided; whether or not a data-sharing agreement will be required and, if so, a brief description of such an agreement (including the criteria for deciding who can receive the data and whether or not any conditions will be placed on their use); and the mode of data sharing (e.g., under its own auspices by mailing a disk or posting data on its institutional or personal website or through a data archive or enclave). investigators choosing to share under their own auspices may wish to enter into a data-sharing agreement. references to data sharing may also be appropriate in other sections of the application.ahrq and pcori encourage openness in research and making research data available for purposes of replication and reproducibility. recipients, upon the request of ahrq, may be required to develop, maintain, and implement a data management and sharing plan that addresses the management, retention, and sharing of data collected in connection with research projects funded under this nofo in a manner that is appropriate for the nature of any such research project and the types of research project data, and that is consistent with all applicable privacy, confidentiality, and other legal requirements. to the extent required by ahrq or voluntarily developed by the recipient, the data management and sharing plan must be acceptable to ahrq. to the extent required by ahrq or voluntarily developed by the recipient, awardee institutions may designate the data repository (e.g., the patient-centered outcomes data repository or a comparable data repository acceptable to ahrq) at which the data will be deposited, and the time period for retention of the research datathe reasonableness of the data sharing plan or the rationale for not sharing research data will be assessed by the reviewers. however, reviewers will not factor the proposed data sharing plan into the determination of scientific merit or the priority score.the ahrq confidentiality statute, 42 usc 299c-3(c), requires that information that is obtained in the course of ahrq supported activities and that identifies individuals or establishments be used only for the purpose for which it was supplied. information that is obtained in the course of ahrq-supported activities and that identifies an individual may be published or released only with the consent of the individual who supplied the information or is described in it. there are civil monetary penalties for violation of the confidentiality provision of the ahrq statute. 42 usc 299c-3(d). in the human subjects section of the application, applicants must describe procedures for ensuring the confidentiality of the identifying information to be collected (see not-hs-18-012: confidentiality in ahrq-supported research). the description of the procedures should include a discussion of who will be permitted access to this information, both raw data and machine-readable files, and how personal identifiers and other identifying or identifiable data will be restricted and safeguarded. identifiable patient health information collected by recipient under this rfa will also be obtained and managed in accordance with the hipaa privacy rule, 45 cfr parts 160 and 164.the recipient should ensure that computer systems containing confidential data have a level and scope of security that equals or exceeds that established by the hipaa security rules if applicable (see hipaa website in prior paragraph) and that established by the office of management and budget (omb) in omb circular no. a-130, appendix iii - security of federal automated information systems. the applicability and intended means of applying these confidentiality and security standards to subcontractors and vendors, if any, should be addressed in the application.unless otherwise provided in grant awards, ahrq recipients may copyright, or seek patents for, as appropriate, final and interim products and materials developed in whole or in part with ahrq support, including, but not limited to, methodological tools, measures, software with documentation, literature searches, and analyses. such copyrights and patents are subject to a royalty-free, non-exclusive, and irrevocable ahrq license to reproduce, publish, use or disseminate for any purpose consistent with ahrq’s statutory responsibilities and to authorize others to do so for any purpose consistent with ahrq’s statutory responsibilities. in accordance with its legislative dissemination mandate, ahrq purposes may include, subject to statutory confidentiality protections, making project materials, databases, results, and algorithms available for verification or replication by other researchers. in addition, subject to ahrq budget constraints, final products may be made available to the health care community and the public by ahrq or its agents if such distribution would significantly increase access to a product and thereby produce substantial or valuable public health benefits. ordinarily, to accomplish distribution, ahrq publicizes research findings but relies on recipients to publish research results in peer-reviewed journals and to market grant-supported products. ahrq requests that recipients notify the office of communications (oc) when an ahrq-funded research article has been accepted for publication in a peer-reviewed journal. researchers should submit manuscripts that have been accepted for publication in a peer-reviewed journal to journalpublishing@ahrq.hhs.gov at least four to six weeks in advance of the journal’s expected publication date.regulations applicable to ahrq recipients concerning intangible rights and copyright can be found at 45 cfr 75.322.applicants are required to follow the instructions for post-submission materials, as described in the policy. any instructions provided here are in addition to the instructions in the policy.the mission of ahrq is to produce evidence to make health care safer, higher quality, more accessible, equitable, and affordable, and to work with the u.s. department of health and human services (hhs) and other partners to make sure that the evidence is understood and used. as part of this mission, applications submitted to ahrq to support health services research are evaluated for scientific and technical merit
