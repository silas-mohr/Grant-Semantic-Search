research field(s) involved, in consideration of the following review criteria and additional review criteria (as applicable for the project proposed).reviewers will consider each of the review criteria below in the determination of scientific merit, and give a separate score for each. an application does not need to be strong in all categories to be judged likely to have major scientific impact. for example, a project that by its nature is not innovative may be essential to advance a field.does the project address an important problem or a critical barrier to progress in the field? is the prior research that serves as the key support for the proposed project rigorous? if the aims of the project are achieved, how will scientific knowledge, technical capability, and/or clinical practice be improved? how will successful completion of the aims change the concepts, methods, technologies, treatments, services, or preventative interventions that drive this field?are the pd(s)/pi(s), collaborators, and other researchers well suited to the project? if early stage investigators or those in the early stages of independent careers, do they have appropriate experience and training? if established, have they demonstrated an ongoing record of accomplishments that have advanced their field(s)? if the project is collaborative or multi-pd/pi, do the investigators have complementary and integrated expertise; are their leadership approach, governance and organizational structure appropriate for the project?how well does the experience of the pd(s)/pi(s) qualify him/her to lead a large epidemiology study and its related activities (e.g., recruiting participants, establishing study infrastructure, data cleaning and quality control, overseeing multiple study sites if proposed)?does the application challenge and seek to shift current research or clinical practice paradigms by utilizing novel theoretical concepts, approaches or methodologies, instrumentation, or interventions? are the concepts, approaches or methodologies, instrumentation, or interventions novel to one field of research or novel in a broad sense? is a refinement, improvement, or new application of theoretical concepts, approaches or methodologies, instrumentation, or interventions proposed?are innovative approaches to streamline or facilitate data collection and management being proposed? if so, will they be able to translate into study efficiencies?are the overall strategy, methodology, and analyses well-reasoned and appropriate to accomplish the specific aims of the project? have the investigators included plans to address weaknesses in the rigor of prior research that serves as the key support for the proposed project? have the investigators presented strategies to ensure a robust and unbiased approach, as appropriate for the work proposed? are potential problems, alternative strategies, and benchmarks for success presented? if the project is in the early stages of development, will the strategy establish feasibility and will particularly risky aspects be managed? have the investigators presented adequate plans to address relevant biological variables, such as sex, for studies in vertebrate animals or human subjects?if the project involves human subjects and/or nih-defined clinical research, are the plans to address 1) the protection of human subjects from research risks, and 2) inclusion (or exclusion) of individuals on the basis of sex/gender, race, and ethnicity, as well as the inclusion or exclusion of individuals of all ages (including children and older adults), justified in terms of the scientific goals and research strategy proposed?how well will the epidemiologic study be able to address multiple scientific hypotheses? how feasible are the short, intermediate, and long-term goals of the study?how feasible are the recruitment goals? how realistically will the contingency plans manage potential delays or barriers with participant recruitment in the overall study as well as in key subgroups? how achievable are the study's timeline and milestones? how well will the participant assessment support: (a) the study's multiple research hypotheses? (b) the investigation of endpoints of clinical significance and other health outcomes of interest? and (c) follow-up of participants over time, if applicable?is the study design/methodology well described and appropriate? does the research plan include plans to control or account for potential biases and deficiencies (e.g., missing, inconsistent or implausible data; misclassification and information bias; selection bias; potential cofounding)?if applicable, what are the strengths and weaknesses of the applicant's plan for collecting, processing, analyzing, managing, tracking, and storing study biospecimens? how rigorous are the applicant's plans for managing study data? if applicable, are the plans for active and/or passive participant follow-up robust?will the scientific environment in which the work will be done contribute to the probability of success? are the institutional support, equipment and other physical resources available to the investigators adequate for the project proposed? will the project benefit from unique features of the scientific environment, subject populations, or collaborative arrangements?how will the facilities and other resources available to the applicant(s) enable the effective implementation of this study and, if applicable, the efficient operation of a multi-site study? what are the strengths and weaknesses of the study team's overall structure? how effectively will the proposed study sites, committees, sub-committees, and/or working groups be able to coordinate and oversee study activities?if international site(s) is/are proposed, does the application adequately address the complexity of executing the study?as applicable for the project proposed, reviewers will evaluate the following additional items while determining scientific and technical merit, and in providing an overall impact score, but will not give separate scores for these items.protections for human subjectsfor research that involves human
