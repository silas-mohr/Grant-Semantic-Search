description section ii. award information section iii. eligibility information section iv. application and submission information section v. application review information section vi. award administration information section vii. agency contacts section viii. other informationdespite notable progress made in treating and preventing hiv infection with antiretroviral drugs, the rates of infection with human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) have not abated. the continuing human and economic toll of hiv/aids requires multi-directional efforts to develop a preventive hiv vaccine.encouragingly, results including isolation of multiple potent broadly neutralizing antibodies from hiv-infected individuals, the generation of native-like hiv envelope proteins, structural analysis of immunogens and antibodies at the atomic level, advanced understanding of human immunobiology, exploration of alternate animal model, incorporation of multidisciplinary technologies and development of novel assays have opened new prospects for improved vaccine design and evaluation.non-human primate (nhp) challenge studies suggest that some of the designed vaccines inducing cd8+t response alone, and in combination with b cell response, can abort infection or prevent acquisition of virus. additionally, a few correlate analyses of nhp vaccine studies suggest that other properties of antibodies in addition to neutralization may contribute to protection. all these developments provide avenues for further research for rational design and testing of candidate vaccines.the hiv vaccine research and design (hivrad) program supports projects that address hypotheses crucial to the design of an efficacious hiv/aids prophylactic vaccine. applications for five years of support should include plans that have advanced past the exploratory stage and include preliminary data. applications aimed at developing or optimizing a specific vaccine platform should lay out a research pathway with clear decision points. extensive evaluation of vaccine concepts in non-human primates may be included. small animal models, such as transgenic humanized mice, may be included. applications may address, but need not be limited to:research programs funded under this foa will be comprised of multiple components. these are:administrative core: an administrative core provides the overall management, coordination, and supervision of the program. this core administers the plan provided in the application to address long and short-term management of the program.research projects: each application must propose a minimum of two research projects. each project must be well integrated in the program overall.scientific cores: one or more optional scientific cores may be proposed as a resource to the multi-project grant, and each of the proposed cores must support at least two projects.external scientific advisory board (sab): an external scientific advisory board consisting of 3-4 independent experts in areas addressed by the program will be identified soon after award. the sab together with the program director(s)/principal investor(s) (pd(s)/pi(s)) will be responsible for determining progress during the annual site visit.annual meetings: the administrative core will coordinate an annual meeting for all key personnel, the scientific advisory board and niaid staff to review goals and milestones achieved during the year, problems encountered, and external events that may influence the direction of work in following years. it is expected that the sab members will attend annual meetings sponsored by the grantee to assist with interpretation of results and planning of future studies, and to assess progress during the course of the project.note: the following types of studies are non-responsive and will not be reviewed:see section viii. other information for award authorities and regulations.grant: a support

investigators presented strategies to ensure a robust and unbiased approach, as appropriate for the work proposed? are potential problems, alternative strategies, and benchmarks for success presented? if the project is in the early stages of development, will the strategy establish feasibility and will particularly risky aspects be managed? have the investigators presented adequate plans to address relevant biological variables, such as sex, for studies in vertebrate animals or human subjects?if the programinvolves human subjects and/or nih-defined clinical research, are the plans to address: 1) the protection of human subjects from research risks, and 2) inclusion (or exclusion) of individuals on the basis of sex/gender, race, and ethnicity, as well as the inclusion or exclusion of individuals of all ages (including children and older adults), justified in terms of the scientific goals and research strategy proposed?specific to this foa: are there coordination and synergy of the
