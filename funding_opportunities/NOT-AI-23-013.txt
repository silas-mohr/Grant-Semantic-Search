the development of animal and cell culture models to study the nervous system pathogenesis of tbds; the development of new approaches to diagnose and treat tbd-associated neurological complications; and clinical cohort studies that seek to characterize the post-acute neurological sequelae of tbds in human patients. please note for pa-20-183, ninds only accepts human mechanistic trials/studies that meets nihâ€™s definition of a clinical trial. applications that include clinical trials designed to answer specific questions about the safety, tolerability, and/or efficacy of an intervention will not be accepted.ninds, as part of nih, also strives for rigor and transparency in all research it funds. for this reason, ninds explicitly emphasizes the nih application instructions related to rigor and transparency (https://grants.nih.gov/policy/reproducibility/guidance.htm) and provides additional guidance to the scientific community (https://www.ninds.nih.gov/funding/grant_policy). for example, the biological rationale for the proposed experiments must be based on rigorous and robust supporting data, which means that data should be collected via methods that minimize the risk of bias and be reported in a transparent manner. if previously published or preliminary studies do not meet these standards, applicants should address how the current study design addresses the deficiencies in rigor and transparency. proposed experiments should likewise be designed in a manner that minimizes the risk of bias and ensures validity of experimental results.application and submission informationthis notice applies to due date on or after february 5, 2023 and subsequent receipt dates through january 7, 2026.applicants must select the ic and associated foa to use for submission of an application in response to the nosi. the selection must align with the ic requirements listed in order to be considered responsive to that foa. non-responsive applications will be withdrawn from consideration for this initiative.in addition, applicants using nih parent announcements (listed below) will be assigned to those ics on this nosi that have indicated those foas are acceptable and based on usual application-ic assignment practices.submit applications for this initiative using one of the following funding opportunity announcements (foas) or any reissues of these announcement through the expiration date of this notice.activity codefoatitlefirst available due dateparticipating icsr01pa-20-183nih research project grant (parent r01 clinical trial required)february 5, 2023niaid, niams, nimh, nindsr01pa-20-185nih research project grant (parent r01 clinical trial not allowed)february 5, 2023niaid, niams, nimh, nindsr41/r42pa-22-178phs 2022-02 omnibus solicitation of the nih for small business technology transfer grant applications (parent sttr [r41/r42] clinical trial not allowed)april 5, 2023niaid, niams, nimh, nindsr43/r44pa-22-176phs 2022-02 omnibus solicitation of the nih, cdc, and fda for small business innovation research grant applications (parent sbir [r43/r44] clinical trial not allowed)april 5, 2023niaid, niams, nimh, nindsr15par-22-060research enhancement award program (reap) for health professional schools and graduate schools (r15 clinical trial not allowed)february 25, 2023niaid, niams, nimh, nindsr21pa-20-195nih exploratory/developmental research grant program (parent r21 clinical trial not allowed)february 16, 2023niaid, niamsr21pa-21-219joint ninds/nimh exploratory neuroscience research grant (r21 clinical trial optional)february 16, 2023nimh, nindsr03pa-20-200nih small research grant program (parent r03 clinical trial not allowed)february 16, 2023niaid, nimh, nindsall instructions in the sf424 (r&r) application guide and the funding opportunity announcement used for submission must be followed, with the following additions:applications nonresponsive to terms of this nosi will not be considered for the nosi initiative.samuel perdue, ph.d. national institute of allergy and infectious diseases (niaid) telephone: 240-627-3341 e-mail: sperdue@nih.govsu-yau mao, ph.d. national institute of arthritis and musculoskeletal and skin diseases (niams) telephone: 301-594-5032 email: maos2@mail.nih.govsarah h. lisanby, m.d.. national institute of mental health (nimh) telephone: 301-451-3029 email: lisanbysh@mail.nih.govwilliam daley, ph.d. national institute of neurological disorders and stroke (ninds) telephone: 301-496-1431 email: william.daley@nih.govweekly toc for this announcement nih funding opportunities and noticesnote: for help accessing pdf, rtf, ms word, excel, powerpoint, audio or video files, see help downloading files.
