been an overreliance on the prescription of opioids for chronic pain despite their poor ability to improve function and high addiction liability. this contributed to a significant and alarming epidemic of opioid addictions and overdose deaths. innovative scientific solutions to develop alternative pain treatments are critically needed.through targeted research efforts, the nih heal initiative aims to accelerate the discovery and successful translation of pain therapeutics by supporting collaborative efforts to gain a better, more direct understanding of human pain-associated genes, cells, and tissues that underly specific human pain types, conditions and/or diseases. towards that end, this funding opportunity announcement (foa) is designed to support a human pain-associated genes & cells data coordination and integration center that will work closely with companion u19 centers for discovery and functional evaluation of human pain-associated genes & cells to curate and harmonize generated datasets characterizing the functional genetic elements, epigenetic signatures, and molecular/cellular pathways that contribute to human pain signal transduction, transmission, and processing. the center will also lead efforts to integrate these datasets and generate digital resources, such as interactive maps, machine-readable protocols, data dictionaries, and other materials, that can be used widely by the research community.backgroundthis funding announcement is part of the nih’s helping to end addiction long-term (heal) initiative to speed scientific solutions to the national opioid public health crisis. the nih heal initiative bolsters research across nih to (1) improve treatment for opioid misuse and addiction and (2) enhance pain management. more information about the heal initiative is available at: https://heal.nih.gov/.the advent of single cell -omics and high throughput electrophysiologic technologies provide an immense opportunity to significantly expand currently available datasets concerning gene expression and cellular function of human pain processing cells and/or tissues. for example, several recent transcriptomic and single-cell functional studies utilizing primary neurons from human pain processing tissues; namely dorsal root ganglia (drg), spinal cord (sc), trigeminal ganglia (tg), and tibial nerves, have identified a number of potential genetic and cellular differences in human sensory neuron electrophysiologic signatures with translational implications. in addition, recent comparative transcriptomic studies of [whole] drgs obtained from human subjects with or without pain conditions suggest several common genes associated with a small subset of neuropathic and cancer pain conditions. while promising, these data only begin to uncover the breadth of knowledge to be gained in this space and highlight the need to expand datasets to include heterogeneities across specific pain type/conditions comparing variables such as chronic analgesic or other drug use and co-morbid and/or overlapping pain conditions. it also highlights the need for standardization of methods, as approaches for tissue collection, processing, and analysis often vary across individual laboratories, thus posing a tremendous challenge for harmonized data collection, analysis, and reporting that would enable cross-comparison and rigorous validation.to capitalize on recent technological advances in high throughput analyses of molecular, anatomic, and physiological measurements for single cell and tissue-level characterizations and address the increasing need to enhance data interoperability and harmonization among data producers, the nih heal initiative has created the program to reveal and evaluate cells-to-gene information that specify intricacies, origins and the nature of human pain (precision human pain). the precision human pain network will be composed of a group of centers supported via two foas; the companion foa, rfa-ns-22-018, will support a group of u19 centers for discovery and functional evaluation of human pain-associated genes & cells. the subject of this foa is the u24 human pain-associated genes & cells data coordination and integration center that will curate and harmonize core datasets generated by the u19 centers and integrate these datasets into digital resources.rapid progress in the discovery and understanding of the role of functional genetic elements, epigenetic signatures, and molecular/cellular pathways that underlie human pain processing, as well as integrated data analysis and development of digital assets will require collaborations across disciplines. to effectively achieve the goals of the precision human pain network and facilitate advances in pain research, the nih heal initiative encourages the formation of multidisciplinary research teams including neurobiologists, pain biologists, human pain scientists and/or physicians, and scientists from statistics, physics, mathematics, engineering, and computer and information sciences. nih and the nih heal initiative also strongly encourage input from patients and caregivers on the scientific and research goals of precision human pain network.in addition to scientific diversity, applicants should strive to incorporate diversity in their team development plan. research shows that diverse teams working together and capitalizing on innovative ideas and distinct perspectives outperform homogenous teams. scientists and trainees from diverse backgrounds and life experiences bring different perspectives, creativity, and individual enterprise to address complex scientific problems. there are many benefits that flow from a diverse nih-supported scientific workforce, including: fostering scientific innovation, enhancing global competitiveness, contributing to robust learning environments, improving the quality of the research, advancing the likelihood that underserved or health disparity populations participate in, and benefit from health research, and enhancing public trust. please refer to notice of nih's interest in diversity?not-od-20-031?for more details.the nih heal initiative will require a high level of coordination and sharing between investigators. it is expected that nih heal initiative awardees will cooperate and coordinate their activities after awards are made by participating in program director/principal investigator (pd/pi) meetings, including an annual heal investigators meeting, as well as other activities. in addition, it is expected that precision human pain centers will work together, operating as a cooperative network to achieve its overall goals. this will include regular meetings and other coordinated activities within the precision human pain network as well as the nih heal initiative. in particular, network centers will work closely with the heal data ecosystem, which coordinates data sharing across the nih heal initiative.research objectives the nih heal initiative - precision human pain networkin alignment with the goals of the nih heal initiative’s precision human pain network, this foa intends to support a human pain-associated genes & cells data coordination and integration center (dcic) that will work closely with the precision human pain network u19 centers on the discovery and functional evaluation of human pain-associated genes & cells to adopt and promote standard terminology, data acquisition protocols, quality control metrics, and metadata requirements to enhance data interoperability and harmonization.the u19 centers will consist of multidisciplinary groups of researchers who will conduct collaborative, team-based science utilizing cutting-edge technologies and approaches to generate comprehensive datasets from primary human tissues involved in pain signal transduction, transmission, and processing, including but not limited to drg, sc, tg, sympathetic ganglia (sg), brainstem, brain, peripheral nerve bundles/fibers, and skin. u19 center research projects will focus on large-scale, high-throughput analyses of human genes, epigenetic elements, proteome, metabolome, and phenotyping of neuronal and non-neuronal cells at the single-cell and tissue levels, as well as their functional crosstalk that leads to the hyper/hypo-activation of sensory neurons within the context of individual pain types, pain conditions and/or diseases. the dcic will then collaboratively generate comprehensive, integrated datasets by curating and harmonizing u19 center-generated data and metadata elements.key objectives of the precision human pain network are to:in order to maximize the utility of the data, any human biological samples collected and studied or that are derived from existing biospecimens or sources are expected to have been obtained using a documented informed consent process that explicitly allows for future research use and broad data sharing (not-hg-20-011; see encode project for informed consent examples). sources with participant consent for unrestricted access is strongly encouraged. the dcic will work with the u19 centers to coordinate standardized consent language for broad sharing across the network and the broader research community, as appropriate. applicants are also expected to consider ethical, legal and social issues (elsi) of tissue collection and to consider return of results to donors or their families.a central goal of the precision human pain network is to build a human pain-associated genes, cellular function and tissue microenvironment resource that can be widely used throughout the research community. the expected outcomes of the network include:the comprehensive -omics and cellular function datasets generated from this initiative will significantly accelerate validation of therapeutic targets in human pain-relevant cells and tissue as well as facilitate the identification and development of potential markers that reflect target engagement, thus providing valuable assets for translational research and therapeutic development. these studies would be highly informative for multiple ongoing and future pre-clinical and translational programs in the nih heal initiative and the nih more broadly.the precision human pain network dcic will be a member of a larger heal initiative data ecosystem that will work across heal initiative activities to promote integration of a variety of data types. the heal data ecosystem coordinates data sharing across the nih heal initiative, including such efforts as generating a metadata model and curation guidance supporting discovery, access to, and reuse of digital assets produced by heal-funded projects. in addition, the heal data ecosystem is generating materials to guide investigators in storing their data in appropriate long-term repositories, leveraging this forementioned metadata to make data easily findable, accessed, and reused within the heal platform, which is a cloud-based and multifunctional web interface that provides a secure environment for discovery and analysis of nih heal results and data. these materials, both developed and upcoming, can be found at healdatafair.org.research scope of the human pain-associated genes & cells data coordination and integration centerthe data coordination and integration center (dcic) will establish a web-accessible information system for network-generated data and metadata derived from primary human tissues involved in pain processing by adopting and promoting common coordinate systems and semantic standards. tissue and cell atlases and common coordinate systems play a fundamental role in gathering, analyzing, communicating, and standardizing data. this foa embraces existing efforts of the research community (e.g., the international neuroinformatics coordination facility) to collaboratively build up human neural tissue atlases with broadly accessible common coordinate systems for datasets on human pain-associated genes, cellular function and tissue analysis. the dcic is expected to:while the information system and associated digital assets will initially be developed specifically for u19-generated datasets, applicants should consider flexibilities to incorporate other potentially relevant datasets in the future, as well as the overall sustainability and scalability of the digital resources developed through this initiativethere will be two parts to the dcic: a data coordination component and a data integration and visualization component.data coordination componentthe data coordination component will interface directly with the precision human pain network u19 centers on the discovery and functional evaluation of human pain-associated genes & cells. throughout the funding period, it will be essential for this component to work with the u19 center investigators and data cores to define data and metadata types to be collected in support of the overall network goals. although contributing projects will not yet be known at the time of application submission, expected data elements include: (1) molecular signatures (e.g., transcriptome, epigenome, proteome, metabolome), (2) anatomy (e.g., cell and nerve/neurite location, size, orientation, morphology, and connectivity), and (3) functions (e.g., electrophysiology, functional connectivity). the following data types are likely to be collected: fluorescence in situ hybridization (fish), single cell rnaseq, immunohistochemistry, cell morphology, neuronal connectivity, electrophysiology, calcium imaging, mass spectrometry-based proteome and metabolome, etc. due to the heterogeneous nature of the tissue, pain, drug use and co-morbid conditions, as well as the heterogeneous data being collected, a key functionality of the dcic will be to link and display datasets in space and time and give users the ability to easily browse and navigate datasets on the basis of key metadata fields including (but not limited to):the data coordination component will develop a secured database that can receive data from the u19 centers and allows for private collaboration among researchers prior to public release, leveraging the heal platform infrastructure as appropriate. this component will also develop a quality control and quality assurance pipeline for (meta)data ensuring appropriate quality control standards for laboratories within the network. heal initiative-wide metadata models developed by the heal data ecosystem should also be included. the dcic may take the strategy of reviewing all data submissions and giving them grades with respect to the adherence of that dataset to the standards set up by the network. the dcic will also help to establish domain specific quality control metrics, metadata requirements, and controlled vocabularies beyond those required by the heal data ecosystem to ensure that the data are interoperable and maximally useful to the community.the data coordination component will work closely with awardees funded under the precision human pain network to collect and archive datasets in heal-recommended existing repositories, where appropriate, along with experimental and analytical protocols. the dcic is also encouraged to work closely with the nih heal initiative’s data ecosystem to ensure that data generated by the network is findable and accessible through the heal platform. the dcic may also help network awardees deposit data into other sustainable databases, such as those supported by the ncbi.the data coordination component will work with the research community, biomedical journals, and with other interested parties, such as the nih brain initiative cell census network (biccn) to adopt and promote a standard terminology to describe experiments and datasets by leveraging existing resources (e.g., neuroscience information framework, bams, allen brain atlas). this will include a nomenclature for the cells and neural circuits themselves. it is also highly encouraged that data coordinating centers across the research community and heal programs collaborate in implementing and aligning with heal data ecosystem recommendations, guidance, and infrastructure.data integration and visual componentthe data integration and visualization component will play a pivotal role in data management and integration and will be expected to be staffed mostly by specialists in informatics. it will process and register data to common neural tissue coordinate systems, generate digital neural tissue atlases, link multiple data elements (e.g., molecular, anatomical, and functional) in space and time for cell type taxonomy, and provide analyses and reports for presentation to awardees, advisors, nih staff, and the heal initiative multi-disciplinary workgroup. the data integration and visualization component is expected to implement user-friendly data registration tools for the precision human pain network to interact with the digital neural tissue atlases to share and cross validate the data. it will also lead the effort to establish spatial and semantic standards that will incorporate multiple ways to define a location in the pain neuraxis, including spatial coordinates, anatomic names, and spatial organizational rules of neural tissue.the data integration and visualization component will develop tools that provide analytical and visualization capabilities to its end users. it will also develop a database that is broadly accessible to anyone with a web browser to view and access data or tools, protocols, and other relevant information generated by the network. the web site is expected to have a broad user base that will include both naïve users and experienced bioinformaticians and should provide an interface that will accommodate both types of users. some datasets may require controlled access although it is expected that most datasets will not. the dcic may, but is not required to, leverage the nih strides initiative to support its activities as appropriate. to the extent allowable in alignment with open-access licensure and protection of sensitive data, digital assets crucial to the reproducibility of the research data lifecycle and data reuse, including analytic software and code, should be made shareable and accessible in alignment with the heal platform protocols and infrastructure. to promote broad discovery and reuse, these data and tools can be version controlled, assigned persistent identifiers and appropriate metadata to support their accessibility through the heal platform and other heal data ecosystem websites.the data integration and visualization component will be responsible for coordination with other relevant informatics efforts (such as the nih brain initiative, sparc, and the work of the international neuroinformatics coordination facility) and will be expected to identify, use, and support standard practices and pipelines to align the dcic with community standards, and other data repositories and knowledgebases as appropriate to create a unified spatial and semantic framework and neural tissue and cell information system. the dcic will have the responsibility for operating an infrastructure that is useful to the community but should use and/or leverage existing infrastructures and standards. these would include persistent identifiers such as digital object identifiers and/or resource identifiers. while there will be some parts of the application that propose to do research for optimal solutions, the focus should be on delivering the infrastructure – not on research.other coordination and communication functionsthe dcic will also provide the administrative infrastructure and functions necessary to facilitate and coordinate both internal precision human pain network communication and activities to maximize the impact of the program as well as external partnerships and outreach. specifically, the dcic will be tasked with:meeting organization: in cooperation with other centers and the nih, the dcic will take primary responsibility for the planning and logistics associated with organizing the precision human pain network meetings that include monthly on-line and annual in-person steering committee meetings, and subcommittee meetings involving informatics efforts such as developing and implementing spatial and semantic standards, data/metadata submission and deposition.precision human pain network communication: to facilitate communication across the network and with the heal data ecosystem, the dcic will provide resources such as mailing lists, forums, or wikis to enable discussion. when needed, the dcic will provide computational and data analysis support to the precision human pain network members and the nih to identify knowledge gaps, prioritize research, and prepare reports.education and outreach: to facilitate the data use by the broad scientific community, the dcic will be responsible for coordinating education and outreach efforts. this could include, for example, the development of tutorials, conducting user workshops, use of social media outlets, or other activities not specifically named here.see section viii. other information for award authorities and regulations.cooperative agreement:

contained in section 872 of the duncan hunter national defense authorization act of fiscal year 2009 (public law 110-417), nih awards will be subject to the federal awardee performance and integrity information system (fapiis) requirements. fapiis requires federal award making officials to review and consider information about an applicant in the designated integrity and performance system (currently fapiis) prior to making an award. an applicant, at its option, may review information in the designated integrity and performance systems accessible through fapiis and comment on any information about itself that a federal agency previously entered and is currently in fapiis. the federal awarding agency will consider any comments by the applicant, in addition to other information in fapiis, in making a judgement about the applicant’s integrity, business ethics, and record of performance under federal awards when completing the review of risk posed by applicants as described in 45 cfr part 75.205 and 2 cfr part 200.206 “federal awarding agency review of risk posed by applicants.” this provision will apply to all nih grants and cooperative agreements except fellowships.the following special terms of award are in addition to, and not in lieu of, otherwise applicable u.s. office of management and budget (omb) administrative guidelines, u.s. department of health and human services (dhhs) grant administration regulations at 45 cfr parts 75 and 2 cfr part 200, and other hhs, phs, and nih grant administration policies. the administrative and funding instrument used for this program will be the cooperative agreement, an "assistance" mechanism (rather than an "acquisition" mechanism), in which substantial nih programmatic involvement with the awardees is anticipated during the performance of the activities. under the cooperative agreement, the nih purpose is to support and stimulate the recipients' activities by involvement in and otherwise working jointly with the award recipients in a partnership role; it is not to assume direction, prime responsibility, or a dominant role in the activities. consistent with this concept, the dominant role and prime responsibility resides with the awardees for the project as a whole, although specific tasks and activities may be shared among the awardees and the nih as defined below.the pd(s)/pi(s) will have the primary responsibilities as described below:nih staff have substantial programmatic involvement that is above and beyond the normal stewardship role in awards, as described below:areas of joint responsibility include:precision human pain network steering committee:the steering committee will be composed of the pd(s)/pi(s), project scientist(s) and external scientific panel members (experts to be named after award). the steering committee may also include designated representatives from the heal data sharing ecosystem, as appropriate. the steering committee will be established to help monitor progress, encourage improvements, and coordinate the production of human pain-associated genes, cellular function and tissue analysis datasets and resources through the precision human pain network. it is anticipated that additional coordination mechanisms might be set up with other u.s. and international groups that may join this effort. the precision human pain network steering committee members will meet periodically to plan and design activities, review and discuss progress, and establish priorities and policies. a chair will be designated on a rotating basis as needed. each pd(s)/pi(s), and external scientific advisor will have one vote each and the nih will have one vote through the participation of the project scientist(s). the frequency of meetings will be determined by the project scientist(s) who will be responsible for scheduling the time and place and for preparing concise proceedings or minutes which will be delivered to the steering committee members within 30 days after the meeting. awardee members of the steering committee will be required to accept and implement policies approved by the steering committee.the precision human pain network steering committee will:external scientific panel (esp):the esp will provide recommendations to the nih heal initiative precision human pain network project team and the precision human pain network about the progress and scientific direction of all components of the program. the esp will be composed of four to six senior scientists who represent broad research community and have relevant expertise, although the membership may be enlarged permanently or on an ad hoc basis as needed. the esp will meet at least twice a year; some meetings may be conducted by telephone conference. at least once a year, there will be a joint meeting with the steering committee for the members of both esp and steering committees to interact directly. twice a year the esp will make recommendations regarding progress of the precision human pain network and present advice to the nih heal initiative precision human pain network project team about changes, if any, that may be necessary in the heal initiative precision human pain program.dispute resolution:any disagreements that may arise in scientific or programmatic matters (within the scope of the award) between award recipients and the nih may be brought to dispute resolution. a dispute resolution panel composed of three members will be convened. it will have three members: a designee of the steering committee chosen without nih staff voting, one nih designee, and a third designee with expertise in the relevant area who is chosen by the other two; in the case of individual disagreement, the first member may be chosen by the individual awardee. this special dispute resolution procedure does not alter the awardee's right to appeal an adverse action that is otherwise appealable in accordance with phs regulation 42 cfr part 50, subpart d and dhhs regulation 45 cfr part 16.data management and sharingnote: the nih policy for data management and sharing is effective for due dates on or after january 25, 2023.consistent with the nih policy for data management and sharing, when data management and sharing is applicable to the award, recipients will be required to adhere to the data management and sharing requirements as outlined in the nih grants policy statement. upon the approval of a data management and sharing plan, it is required for recipients to implement the plan as described.3. reportingwhen multiple years are involved, recipients will be required to submit the research performance progress report (rppr) annually and financial statements as required in the nih grants policy statement.a final rppr, invention statement, and the expenditure data portion of the federal financial report are required for closeout of an award, as described in the nih grants policy statement. nih foas outline intended research goals and objectives. post award, nih will review and measure performance based on the details and outcomes that are shared within the rppr, as described at 45 cfr part 75.301 and 2 cfr part 200.301.the federal funding accountability and transparency act of 2006 (transparency act), includes a requirement for recipients of federal grants to report information about first-tier subawards and executive compensation under federal assistance awards issued in fy2011 or later. all recipients of applicable nih grants and cooperative agreements are required to report to the federal subaward reporting system (fsrs) available at www.fsrs.gov on all subawards over $25,000. see the nih grants policy statement for additional information on this reporting requirement.in accordance with the regulatory requirements provided at 45 cfr 75.113 and appendix xii to 45 cfr part 75, recipients that have currently active federal grants, cooperative agreements, and procurement contracts from all federal awarding agencies with a cumulative total value greater than $10,000,000 for any period of time during the period of performance of a federal award, must report and maintain the currency of information reported in the system for award management (sam) about civil, criminal, and administrative proceedings in connection with the award or performance of a federal award that reached final disposition within the most recent five-year period. the recipient must also make semiannual disclosures regarding such proceedings. proceedings information will be made publicly available in the designated integrity and performance system (currently fapiis). this is a statutory requirement under section 872 of public law 110-417, as amended (41 u.s.c. 2313). as required by section 3010 of public law 111-212, all information posted in the designated integrity and performance system on or after april 15, 2011, except past performance reviews required for federal procurement contracts, will be publicly available. full reporting requirements and procedures are found in appendix xii to 45 cfr part 75 – award term and conditions for recipient integrity and performance matters.we
