nih exploratory/developmental research grant program (parent r21 clinical trial required)eunice kennedy shriver national institute of child health and human development (nichd)vaccines are a central component of preventive care for populations of high priority to the nichd. nichd's priority populations include infants, children, adolescents, pregnant and lactating women, and persons with physical and intellectual disabilities, particularly those who are also underserved or experience health disparities. strategies that promote access, acceptance and uptake of cdc-recommended vaccines among these populations have the potential not only to reduce the incidence of vaccine-preventable diseases, but also to promote health and well-being and to improve trust in science and health care. the ongoing covid-19 pandemic makes this initiative especially timely because many jurisdictions seek to effectively deploy vaccines against covid-19 as they are approved and become more readily available for children. furthermore, insights gained from this initiative may inform efforts to ameliorate declines in rates of routine childhood and adolescent vaccine delivery.the reasons for lower rates of vaccine uptake are varied, but include concerns about vaccine safety, possible long-term side effects, the potential for interactions with prescribed medications, and pre-existing conditions or disabilities. these concerns can be compounded by lack of vaccine acceptance due to skepticism regarding the accuracy or completeness of available information, low perceived risk of infection or severe illness, low perceived efficacy of available vaccines, beliefs regarding other preventive strategies against vaccine-preventable infections, or high perceived risk of adverse events. finally, structural and historical factors, including costs and systemic barriers that impede access to care, can all have the common end effect of decreasing rates of vaccine access. social determinants of health (sdoh), defined as the conditions in the environments where people are born, live, learn, work, play, worship and age (https://health.gov/healthypeople/objectives-and-data/social-determinants-health), intersect with these structural and historical factors in ways that also influence rates of vaccine access, acceptability and uptake. for many nichd priority populations, vaccine uptake has added complexity because the person providing consent for vaccination may not be the person receiving the vaccine.this nosi encourages applications that address dimensions of access, acceptance and uptake of cdc-recommended vaccines among infants, children, adolescents, pregnant and lactating women, and persons with disabilities, especially among populations who are underserved or experience health disparities.high priority applications will focus on nichd-priority populations and issues that include but are not limited to the following:projects targeting access, acceptance and uptake of routine vaccines among children and adolescents will be considered within scope, with the exception of projects focused specifically on vaccines against human papillomavirus (hpv). applications addressing hpv vaccine uptake among children and adolescents belonging to populations that experience health disparities may, however, be within scope for another nih institute or center as described, for example, in not-md-21-008.projects targeting access and uptake of vaccines against sars-cov-2 (covid-19) will also be considered within scope for this nosi.the following topic areas are not within scope for this nosi:applications on these topics will not be considered for funding by nichd.application and submission informationthis notice applies to due dates on or after september 8, 2021 and subsequent receipt dates through september 8, 2024.submit applications for this initiative using one of the following funding opportunity announcements (foas) or any reissues of these announcement through the expiration date of this notice.all instructions in the sf424 (r&r) application guide and the funding opportunity announcement used for submission must be followed, with the following additions:applications nonresponsive to terms of this nosi will not be considered for the nosi initiative.scientific/research contact(s)regina m. bures, ph.d. eunice kennedy shriver national institute of child health and human development (nichd) phone: 301-496-9485 email: regina.bures@nih.govtracy m. king, m.d., m.p.h. eunice kennedy shriver national institute of child health and human development (nichd) phone: 301-402-1822 email: tracy.king@nih.govweekly toc for this announcement nih funding opportunities and noticesnote: for help accessing pdf, rtf, ms word, excel, powerpoint, audio or video files, see help downloading files.
