institutes/centers. the following nih offices may co-fund applications assigned to those institutes/centers.office of aids research (oar)division of program coordination, planning and strategic initiatives, office of disease prevention (odp)office of research on women's health (orwh)the mission of the nih is to seek fundamental knowledge about the nature and behavior of living systems and the application of that knowledge to enhance health, lengthen life, and reduce illness and disability. the nih is committed to supporting research that will increase scientific understanding of the health and well-being of various population and subpopulation groups and that will help to establish the effectiveness of evidence-based health interventions and services for individuals within these groups. nih places high priority on research with populations that have distinct health risk profiles and who have also received insufficient attention from the scientific research enterprise. to this end, this notice of special interest (nosi) announces the availability of administrative supplements to provide funding for the expansion of existing research projects to incorporate sexual and gender minority (sgm) populations or sgm-relevant research questions. sgm populations include, but are not limited to, those populations described in not-od-19-139. basic, social, behavioral, clinical, translational, and health services research relevant to the missions of the sponsoring nih institutes or centers (ics) may be proposed in response to this solicitation. potential applicants are encouraged to review the most recent annual portfolio analysis of nih-funded sgm research to identify potential research gaps that may be relevant to this nosi. more information about the sgm administrative supplements program and previously awarded research projects can be found on the sgmro website.backgroundthe collective knowledge base on sgm health has grown substantially since the release of the groundbreaking 2011 institute of medicine (now the national academy of medicine) report on the health of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender people. however, in their comprehensive 2020 report on the status and well-being of people who identify as sgm, the national academiesâ€™ committee on population ultimately concluded that sgms still face numerous disparities across multiple domains of well-being. in october 2016, the national institute on minority health and health disparities, in collaboration with the agency for healthcare research and quality, announced that sgms had been officially designated a health disparity population for nih research purposes. this designation has facilitated the creation of tailored research projects, programs, activities, and funding opportunities to tackle the unique health-related issues encountered by sgm individuals. in addition, ascertainment of sgm status in ongoing and planned population studies has been enhanced. however, it is apparent that sgm-specific health disparities persist today, and there is still an urgent need for novel strategies to understand, measure, address, and prevent them.as of august 28, 2019, the nih definition of "sexual and gender minorities" includes, but is not limited to, individuals who identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, asexual, transgender, two-spirit, queer, and/or intersex. individuals with same-sex or -gender attractions or behaviors and those with a difference in sex development are also included. these populations also encompass those who do not self-identify with one of these terms but whose sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, or reproductive development is characterized by non-binary constructs of sexual orientation, gender, and/or sex. applicants to this administrative supplement may propose to study relevant sgm subpopulations not explicitly identified in this definition and/or adopt other classification frameworks and terminologies as appropriate.specific areas of research interestthis nosi calls for research that will enrich scientific understanding of how sexual orientation, gender identity, and/or being born with differences/disorders in sex development (dsds) or intersex characteristics relate to health outcomes, health risks, health behaviors, perceptions and expectations about health, and access to health-related services or associated barriers.appropriate topics or studies for these supplements may include, but are not limited to, those listed below:scope of supportadministrative supplements can be used to meet increased costs that are within the scope of the approved parent award, but that were unforeseen when the new or renewal application or grant progress report for non-competing continuation support was submitted. applicants to this nosi should propose research that, if successful, would contribute to a greater understanding of the health and well-being of sgm communities. clinical trials cannot be proposed to be added to grants that do not include a clinical trial as that would constitute a change in scope.ic-specific considerationsall applications submitted in response to this nosi should fall within the mission of the ic of the awarded parent grant. applicants are strongly encouraged to discuss their proposed supplement project with the ic program officer of the funded parent award prior to submission of a supplement application in order to ensure that the proposed activity aligns with the scientific priorities of the ic and is within the scope of the parent award. scientific inquiries may also be addressed to the contacts listed in the inquiries section below.other informationrecently issued trans-nih policy notices may affect your application submission. a full list of policy notices published by nih is provided in the nih guide for grants and contracts. all awards are subject to the terms and conditions, cost principles, and other considerations described in the nih grants policy statement.authority and regulationsawards are made under the authorization of sections 301 and 405 of the public health service act as amended (42 usc 241 and 284) and under federal regulations 42 cfr part 52 and 45 cfr part 75.please recognize that all sgm administrative supplement awards are made specifically for conducting the research proposed in each application. progress reports specific to the sgm administrative supplement may be requested by sgmro at any point. these progress report requests will be sent under separate cover from the research performance progress report. unsatisfactory progress or reallocation of supplement funds to another purpose outside of the proposed research plan may lead to disqualification of participating programs from future consideration for this opportunity.application and submission informationapplications for this initiative must be submitted using the following opportunity or its subsequent reissued equivalent.all instructions in the sf424 (r&r) application guide and pa-20-272 must be followed, with the following additions:applications that do not comply with these instructions or are
