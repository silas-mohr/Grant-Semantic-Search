proinflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and chemokine receptors that attract and expand immune cells at sites of injury; and proteins driving ischemia reperfusion injury, inflammation, and graft dysfunction.research objectives and scopethis nosi aims to stimulate multidisciplinary research collaborations that utilize cutting-edge technologies to apply progress made in scge to transplantation research. research funded by this nosi may utilize various models, including human tissues or organs excluded from clinical use and/or rodent, porcine, or nonhuman primate models. the research should address unmet needs in vca, islet, or organ allotransplantation, such as the prevention or treatment of rejection; achievement of transplant tolerance; prolongation of allograft survival; protection from the toxicities of pharmacologic immunosuppression; and improvements in the organ/cellular function of transplanted grafts.areas of interestniaid areas of interest:the goal of niaid transplantation research is to improve the long-term success of organ, tissue, and cell transplantation by understanding the role the immune system plays in transplant success or failure and modifying the immune response in a way that will improve long-term transplant survival and reduce the need for broadly immunosuppressive medications, which can cause significant side effects.scge approaches may include ex vivo or in vivo targeting of donor or recipient organs, tissues, or cells designed to reduce graft immunogenicity and/or improve allograft survival and function. applicants are encouraged to explore new or established scge platforms that have minimal intrinsic immunogenicity and infrequent off-target effects.particular areas of interest include but are not limited to:nhlbi areas of interest:nhlbi provides global leadership for a research, training, and education programs to promote the prevention and treatment of heart, lung, and blood diseases and sleep disorders and enhance the health of all individuals so that they can live longer and more fulfilling lives. participation in this nosi directly addresses the nhlbi strategic goals related to a desire to better understand human health and resilience, to stimulate discoveries in the diagnosis and prevention of disease and to facilitate the translation of discoveries from basic research into clinical practice.nhlbi encourages research projects that propose technologies and approaches that include, but are not limited to:the intent of this research is to encourage novel collaborations across disciplines and enhance research outcomes in a dynamic, technically challenging, and potentially high-risk/high-reward area. ideally, such partnerships will have a lasting impact and drive the field forward beyond the lifetime of this nosi.for both niaid and nhlbi, the research areas below will not be supported through this nosi:application and submission informationapplicants must select the ic and associated funding opportunity announcement (foa) to use for submission of an application in response to this nosi. the selection must align with the ic requirements listed in order to be considered responsive to that foa. non-responsive applications will be withdrawn from consideration for this initiative. in addition, applicants using nih parent announcements (listed below) will be assigned to those ics on this nosi that have indicated those foas are acceptable and based on usual application-ic assignment practices.note: nhlbi will only accept applications submitted to the nih research project grant (parent r01 clinical trial not allowed) pa-20-185 target foa and will not accept applications that are submitted via the nih exploratory/developmental research grant program (parent r21 clinical trial not allowed) pa-20-195 target foa. see table below.this notice applies to due dates on or after february 5, 2022 and subsequent receipt dates through january 7, 2025.submit applications for this initiative using one of the following foas or any reissues of these announcements through the expiration date of this notice.activity codefoafirst available due dateparticipating icsr01pa-20-185 - nih research project grant (parent r01 clinical trial not allowed)february 5, 2022niaid, nhlbir21pa-20-195 - nih exploratory/developmental research grant program (parent r21 clinical trial not allowed)february 16, 2022niaidall instructions in the sf424 (r&r) application guide and the listed funding opportunity announcements must be followed, with the following additions:applications nonresponsive to terms of this nosi will be withdrawn from consideration for this initiative.scientific/research contact(s)nasrin nabavi, ph.d. national institute of allergy and infectious diseases (niaid) telephone: 240-627-3538 email: nnabavi@mail.nih.gov rahul gautam thakar, ph.d. national heart, lung, and blood institute (nhlbi) telephone: 301-496-1740 e-mail: rahul.thakar@nih.govpeer review contact(s)examine your era commons account for review assignment and contact information (information appears two weeks after the submission due date).financial/grants management contact(s) tamia powell national institute of allergy and infectious diseases (niaid) telephone: 240-669-2982 email:tamia.powell@nih.gov leslye fulwider national heart, lung, and blood institute (nhlbi) telephone: 301-480-9544 e-mail: leslye.fulwider@nih.govweekly toc for this announcement nih funding opportunities and noticesnote: for help accessing pdf, rtf, ms word, excel, powerpoint, audio or video files, see help downloading files.
