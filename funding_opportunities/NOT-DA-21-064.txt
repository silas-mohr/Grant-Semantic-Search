however, only 1 in 8 people who needed treatment for sud had access to treatment services. the 2020 report called for international cooperation to improve research, data collection, training programs, and implementation of evidence-based prevention and treatment interventions.suds are complex disorders involving disruption of brain circuits involved in reward, decision-making, learning, and self-control. they are mediated by complex biological, social, environmental, and developmental factors that dynamically interact to influence risk, trajectory, and outcomes. understanding this complexity will require drawing upon multiple disciplines across biomedicine, including neuroscience, genetics/epigenetics, behavioral and social sciences, development research, and information sciences. technological advances over the past several years in neuroimaging, optogenetics, gene editing technology, epigenomics, and other innovations are giving us the ability to probe this complexity in entirely new ways, as in the application of big data science to elucidate the biology related to addiction. data harmonization encourages data and resource sharing and permits comparisons within and across localities, regions, and nations, increasing scientific rigor, reproducibility, and real-world relevance of research.research findings from one country can have important implications for other countries – providing data to improve best practices in drug use and addiction policy, prevention, and treatment. continuing research into implementation of evidence-based prevention and treatment interventions in settings with limited resources is applicable to both international settings and those u.s. regions that face similar structural, legal, or fiscal constraints. applications should address the potential of proposed research for advancing domestic u.s. public health and international partners must provide talent, resources, populations, or other resources not readily available in the united states. nida is committed to supporting health equality and building a strong, diverse, multidisciplinary scientific workforce in the united states and abroad. leveraging the global network of scientific experts on addiction will help nida ensure that we all learn from one another’s successes and failures, advance science on the causes and consequences of drug use and addiction and apply that knowledge to improve individual and public health.research objectivessubstances that are of high priority:basic research on neuroscience and biologyepidemiology, intervention, and implementation researchpolicy researchrecovery researchresearch related to:linkages between hiv/aids and drug useper the nih grants policy statement (nihgps) in chapter 8.1.2.10, adding a foreign component under a grant to a domestic or foreign organization requires nih prior approval. for general information about foreign grants, see nihgps chapter 16.this notice applies to due dates on or after october 5, 2021 and subsequent receipt dates through september 8, 2024.submit applications for this initiative using one of the following funding opportunity announcements (foas) or any reissues of these announcement through the expiration date of this notice.pa-20-183: nih research project grant (parent r01 clinical trial required)pa-20-185: nih research project grant (parent r01 clinical trial not allowed)pa-20-200: nih small research grant program (parent r03 clinical trial not allowed)pa-20-195: nih exploratory/developmental research grant program (parent r21 clinical trial not allowed)pa-20-272: administrative supplements to existing nih grants and cooperative agreements (parent admin supp clinical trial optional)all instructions in the sf424 (r&r) application guide and the funding opportunity announcement used for submission must be followed, with the following additions:applications nonresponsive to terms of this nosi will not be considered for the nosi initiative.lindsey friend national institute on drug abuse (nida) telephone:301-402-1428 email: lindsey.friend@nih.govweekly toc for this announcement nih funding opportunities and noticesnote: for help accessing pdf, rtf, ms word, excel, powerpoint, audio or video files, see help downloading files.
