special interest (nosi) to highlight interest in basic, translational, intervention and services research relevant to the covid-19 pandemic. nimh is especially interested in research to provide an evidence base to understand how mental illness contributes to covid-19 risk and mortality, how incident mental illness develops with covid-19, and the development of scalable interventions to meet the public mental health needs during and resulting from the pandemic both specifically related to the virus but also at a broader population level that is impacted by stress, disruptions, and loss of lives in the pandemic. research addressing the intersection of covid-19, mental health, and hiv treatment and prevention are also of interest to nimh. research is anticipated to focus on particularly vulnerable populations based on existing evidence of increased mental health symptoms and illness and preexisting and worsening health disparities.backgroundthe importance of expanding research on the impact of the covid-19 pandemic on mental health is prioritized by the substantial funding proposed in the fiscal year 2022 budgets from both the house and senate. although funds have not yet been appropriated and nimh operates under a continuing resolution which maintains funding at the previous yearâ€™s level, nimh acknowledges the contribution that new research could make to understand, prevent, and treat mental illness in the context of the pandemic. mental illness increases risk for sars-cov-2 infection, is associated with higher mortality from covid-19, and is among the incident illnesses that may emerge following infection. further, the widespread impact of the pandemic even among those not infected has resulted in substantially increased reports of symptoms and illness across the lifespan. researchers responded quickly to the emergence of covid-19 to provide this initial body of knowledge. substantial resources have been devoted to the development of large cohorts and longitudinal studies to support research on the long-term effects of covid-19 (see recover initiative). these efforts are invaluable but are unlikely to provide the depth of mental health research that is needed. similarly, nimh has supported initial research to investigate interventions with deployment-focused models of services design and testing. these projects are anticipated to accelerate new interventions, but few have focused on the early development and late life stages and do not cover all areas of anticipated need.preexisting health disparities related to mental health are worsened by the pandemic. racial and ethnic minority populations have experienced higher rates of infection and loss of life, acute adverse employment and economic impacts, and disproportionate representation among essential workers experiencing increased risk of the virus, and the burden of stress to meet demands of workplaces. the disproportionate mental health burden impacting these communities is consistent and evident in surveillance reports of mental health symptoms. other groups including sexual and gender minorities have similarly reported disproportionate impacts of the covid-19 pandemic on mental health as have socioeconomically disadvantaged and rural populations. addressing mental health disparities, including those associated with the covid-19 pandemic, is a priority of nimh.research objectivesin order to significantly improve our understanding of the risks, mechanisms, and treatment in response to covid-19 among individuals at risk for, or experiencing mental disorders across the lifespan, nimh is encouraging the submission of applications to address the following areas of scientific interest:basic researchtranslational researchservices and intervention researchhiv/aids researchglobal mental health researchadditional areas of research relevant to covid-19 and mental illness should be discussed with scientific program staff for technical assistance with nimh priorities and potential overlap with existing research efforts and other potential funding mechanisms.application and submission informationthis notice applies to due dates on or
