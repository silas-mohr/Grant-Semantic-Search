october 15, 2020pa-20-195 - nih exploratory/developmental research grant program (parent r21 clinical trial not allowed)pa-20-185 - nih research project grant (parent r01 clinical trial not allowed)national institute on aging (nia)the purpose of this notice of special interest (nosi) is to inform applicants of nia’s interest in research on the neural mechanisms underlying fundamental affective processes in aging. grant applications are encouraged to 1) extend research on neural mechanisms underlying affective processes into aging models; and/or 2) seek to “reverse translate” clinical research results on affective processes in aging into model systems that support elucidation of fundamental neural mechanisms. nia also wishes to encourage collaboration among cognitive and affective neuroscientists and/or investigators working at different levels of neurobiological and behavioral analysis.backgroundaffective neuroscience focuses on the neurobiological underpinnings of emotion and related phenomena. the brain plays a key role in orchestrating and fine-tuning affective states and responses, perceiving and interpreting emotionally relevant stimuli, and coordinating responses to these stimuli. despite the importance of affect as a core process in human cognition, research aimed at understanding the neural mechanisms underlying affect is limited, and affective neuroscience studies in older adults and aging animals are rare.investigations of age-related changes in neural systems that govern aspects of arousal, motivation, positive and negative affective responses, and emotion regulation have suggested these functions exhibit complex profiles of adaptation and compensation in aging. interactions among affective and cognitive processes also appear to change with age. recent work has begun to examine individual differences and variation in affective processing in mid- and late-life as a function of sex, early developmental exposures, and current social and environmental context. these investigations are important for building our understanding of how older adults may deploy compensatory neural mechanisms to support adaptive emotional functioning into later life, and potentially support the development of strategies to detect, prevent, and treat affective and behavioral dysregulation. given the close links between affective function and memory formation, such strategies may prove useful for preventing age-related cognitive decline. gaps remain in our understanding of early and/or mid-life changes in neural circuitry supporting affective function with age. deeper knowledge of normative maturation of affective processes complements nia’s investment in brain aging research in other domains (cognitive, sensory-motor, autonomic, etc.).nia seeks applications in affective neuroscience that utilize state-of-the-art approaches and causal designs to elucidate the core neurobiological processes underlying changes in affective functions across normative developmental trajectories of aging, as well as changes related to alzheimer's disease and alzheimer's disease related dementias (ad/adrd). nia also seeks applications that aim to elucidate the core neurobiological processes underlying changes in affective functions across normative developmental trajectories of aging, as well as changes related to alzheimer's disease and alzheimer's disease related dementias (ad/adrd). nia also encourages the use of ecologically relevant behavioral paradigms that allow quantitative, real-time, dynamic behavioral measurements. to ensure rigor and reproducibility, a strong rationale should be provided in all applications for the choice of model systems (e.g., species) and behavioral paradigms.research objectivesthe specific research objectives of this nosi are to: 1) extend research on neural mechanisms underlying affective processes into aging; and/or 2) extend results from research on human affective processes in aging to human or animal models that support elucidation of neural mechanisms. novel research projects are sought in the areas of normative aging, mci, and/or ad/adrd.the scope of scientific questions must be of relevance to the mission of nia and aligned with the nia strategic directions and/or the hhs national plan to address alzheimer’s disease . collaborations among multiple principle investigators and key personnel in complementary disciplines are encouraged.potential research areasresearch proposals responsive to this nosi will include new, resubmission, or renewal projects investigating questions of importance to affective neuroscience in aging such as, but not limited to, the following:application and submission informationthis notice applies to due dates on or after february 5, 2021, and subsequent receipt dates through january 8, 2024.submit applications for this initiative using one of the following funding opportunity announcements (foas) or any reissues of these announcements through the expiration date of this notice.pa-20-195 - nih exploratory/developmental research grant program (parent r21 clinical trial not allowed)pa-20-185 - nih research project grant (parent r01 clinical trial not allowed)investigators planning to submit an application in response to this nosi are strongly encouraged to contact and discuss their proposed research/aims with an nia program officer well in advance of the planned submission date.applications nonresponsive to terms of this nosi will not be considered for the nosi initiative.scientific/research contact(s)matt sutterer, ph.d. national institute on aging (nia) telephone: 301-496-9350 email: matt.sutterer@nih.govjanine simmons, m.d., ph.d. division of behavioral and social research national institute on aging (nia) email: simmonsj@mail.nih.gov weekly toc for this announcement nih funding opportunities and noticesnote: for help accessing pdf, rtf, ms word, excel, powerpoint, audio or video files, see help downloading files.
