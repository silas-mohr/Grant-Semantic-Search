section iii. 3. additional information on eligibility.this funding opportunity announcement (foa) invites applications to support a national program of mentored career development and training in research for junior faculty in pediatric critical care medicine and pediatric trauma surgery. the pediatric critical care and trauma scientist development program (pcctsdp) was developed to fuel the pipeline of well-trained investigators and advance research in the clinically demanding fields of pediatric critical care and trauma surgery.this funding opportunity announcement (foa) allows appointment of scholars (k12)] proposing to serve as the lead investigator of an independent clinical trial; or proposing a separate ancillary clinical trial; or proposing to gain research experience in a clinical trial led by another investigator, as part of their research and career development.not applicableall applications are due by 5:00 pm local time of applicant organization.applicants are encouraged to apply early to allow adequate time to make any corrections to errors found in the application during the submission process by the due date.not applicableit is critical that applicants follow the training (t) instructions in the sf424 (r&r) application guide, except where instructed to do otherwise (in this foa or in a notice from the nih guide for grants and contracts). conformance to all requirements (both in the application guide and the foa) is required and strictly enforced. applicants must read and follow all application instructions in the application guide as well as any program-specific instructions noted in section iv. when the program-specific instructions deviate from those in the application guide, follow the program-specific instructions. applications that do not comply with these instructions may be delayed or not accepted for review.there are several options available to submit your application through grants.gov to nih and department of health and human services partners. you must use one of these submission options to access the application forms for this opportunity.purpose and background informationthe overall goal of the nih research career development programs is to help ensure that a diverse pool of highly trained scientists is available in appropriate scientific disciplines to address the nation’s biomedical, behavioral, and clinical research needs. more information about career programs may be found at the nih extramural training mechanisms website.this foa encourages applications from organizations that propose creative and innovative institutional research career development programs in the mission area(s) of the nih.the proposed institutional research career development program may complement other, ongoing research training and career development programs at the applicant institution, but the proposed career development experiences must be distinct from those career development programs currently receiving federal support.investigators proposing nih-defined clinical trials may refer to the research methods resources website for information about developing statistical methods and study designs.note: this funding opportunity announcement (foa) allows appointment of scholars (k12) proposing to serve as the lead investigator of an independent clinical trial; or proposing a separate ancillary clinical trial; or proposing to gain research experience in a clinical trial led by another investigator, as part of their research and career development.the purpose of this funding opportunity announcement (foa) is to invite applications for the program administration and direction of the pediatric critical care and trauma scientist development program (pcctsdp), a national program of research career development for physician-scientists specializing in pediatric critical care medicine and trauma surgery.the goal of the pcctsdp is to expand the pool of investigators trained to advance research in pediatric critical and trauma care. in doing so, the program aims to stimulate novel research and innovative investigation into the scientific basis of pediatric critical care and trauma practice and the consequences of critical illness and injury for children and their families. additionally, it is intended that this program will build upon and expand the community of investigators who network effectively to advance research in these related fields. the program will fund, up to a maximum of 5 years, the administration and infrastructure of one k12 career development program.within the framework of the pediatric critical care and trauma scientist development program's longstanding commitment to excellence, attention must be given to recruiting a diverse group of prospective investigators to seek opportunities in these relatively nascent and clinically-laden fields, including k12 scholars from groups underrepresented in the biomedical, behavioral and clinical sciences, including individuals from underrepresented racial and ethnic groups individuals with disabilities, individuals from disadvantaged backgrounds, women at the faculty and above level, (see, notice of nih's interest in diversity, not-od-20-031) and individuals working in institutional development award (idea)-eligible states.backgroundseveral convergent developments in critical care medicine, as well as in the larger medical, scientific, and national communities, were fundamental to the initial nichd decision to develop and maintain support of pediatric critical care and trauma career development and research at the junior faculty level. although these fields have exhibited substantial growth over the past decade and outcomes have improved, there are little evidence-based data to drive the field and treatments are still often extrapolated from studies involving adult patients. consequently, there is a vital need for research to best inform the care of critically ill and injured children.to assure that such work will be pursued, a pipeline of well trained and prepared investigators is needed. however, given the intense clinical and physical demands of critical care and trauma training, the paucity of established research mentors in these fields, and the ever-growing educational and administrative responsibilities, it is challenging to maintain a workforce of committed and well-prepared scientists in these fields.objectives and scopeit is expected that the scholars supported by this program will emphasize basic, clinical and/or translational research focused on acute, intermediate and longer-term outcomes for critically ill and/or injured children and their families.the overall purpose and objectives of the program have not changed significantly since the last competitive funding opportunity announcement for this program, although the structure has evolved to enhance function, foster a diverse workforce and optimize opportunity for success of the program.the overarching goal of the initiative is to stimulate pediatric critical care and trauma research in the basic, translational and clinical sciences that will improve outcomes in children who sustain critical illness and/or injury by enhancing research capacity and infrastructure in the field on a national level.more specifically, the objectives of the program are to:diversity statementevery facet of the united states scientific research enterprise — from basic laboratory research to clinical and translational research to policy formation — requires superior intellect, creativity, and a wide range of skill sets and viewpoints. nih’s ability to help ensure that the nation remains a global leader in scientific discovery and innovation is dependent upon a pool of highly talented scientists from diverse backgrounds who will help to further nih's mission.research shows that diverse teams working together and capitalizing on innovative ideas and distinct perspectives outperform homogenous teams. scientists and trainees from diverse backgrounds and life experiences bring different perspectives, creativity, and individual enterprise to address complex scientific problems. there are many benefits that flow from a diverse nih-supported scientific workforce, including: fostering scientific innovation, enhancing global competitiveness, contributing to robust learning environments, improving the quality of the researchers, advancing the likelihood that underserved or health disparity populations participate in, and benefit from health research, and enhancing public trust. see, notice of nih's interest in diversity, not-od-20-031.attention must be given to recruiting prospective scholars and established faculty from diverse backgrounds, including groups that have been identified as underrepresented in the biomedical sciences.note: in addition to basic, translational and clinical research, this funding opportunity announcement (foa) allows appointment of scholars (k12) who will 1) serve as the lead investigator of an independent clinical trial; 2) propose an ancillary clinical trial; or 3) propose to gain research experience in a clinical trial led by another investigator.see section viii. other information for award authorities and regulations.grant: a support mechanism providing money, property, or both to an eligible entity

staff with responsibilities directly associated with the institutional career development program. the cost limit applies to all staff salaries combined. items that may not be supported with k12 grant funds include: salaries and fringe benefits for program mentors; salary and support for central institutional administrative personnel (e.g. budget officers, grant assistants, and building maintenance personnel), which are usually paid from institutional overhead charges; salary and support for administrative activities such as institutional public relations or health and educational services.scholars are those individuals who benefit from the proposed activities and experiences involved in the career development program. scholar costs must be justified as specifically required for the proposed career development program and based on institutional policies for salaries paid to individuals in similar positions, regardless of the source of funds. these expenses must be itemized in the proposed budget.candidates receive two to three years of intense career development training in a basic or clinical science discipline with an established investigator serving as mentor. the program is designed to support an average of four to five scholars per year.salary and fringe benefits:individual scholars are eligible for up to $100,000 per year for salary and fringe benefits, consistent with the institution's salary scale. the institution may supplement the nih salary contribution up to a level that is consistent with the institution's salary scale; however, supplementation may not be from federal funds unless specifically authorized by the federal program from which such funds are derived. the total salary requested must be based on a full-time, 12-month staff appointment and requires scholars to devote a minimum of 9 person-months (75% full-time professional effort) of full-time professional effort to conducting career development and health-related research, with the remaining effort being devoted to activities related to the development of a successful research career.research and career development support:for each scholar, up to $25,000 in additional funds may be budgeted each year to help defray the costs of materials, supplies, technical assistance, and miscellaneous expenses generated by the scholar's research in the departments and laboratories of the established investigators who serve as mentors. grant funds may also be used for tuition, fees, and other educational materials related to career development. travel funds may be budgeted to attend the annual pcctsdp functions and other professional meetings. total awards to individual scholars need not be equal across these different budget categories.items that may not be supported with each scholar's research and career development support category include:consultant costs, equipment, supplies, travel for key persons, and other program-related expenses may be included in the proposed budget. these expenses must be justified as specifically required by the proposed program and must not duplicate items generally available at the applicant institution.other program-related expenses are limited to $25,000 per year, and may include:items that may not be supported with k12 funds include:indirect costs (also known as facilities & administrative [f&a] costs) are reimbursed at 8% of modified total direct costs (exclusive of tuition and fees, consortium costs in excess of $25,000, and expenditures for equipment), rather than on the basis of a negotiated rate agreement.nih grants policies as described in the nih grants policy statement will apply to the applications submitted and awards made from this foa.1. eligible applicantshigher education

reminder: notice of nih's encouragement of applications supporting individuals from underrepresented ethnic and racial groups as well as individuals with disabilities, not-od-22-019.for institutions/organizations proposing multiple pds/pis, visit the multiple program director/principal investigator policy and submission details in the senior/key person profile (expanded) component of the sf 424 (r&r) application guide.the pd/pi should be an established investigator in the scientific area in which the application is targeted and capable of providing both administrative and scientific leadership to the development and implementation of the proposed program. the pd/pi will be responsible for the selection and appointment of trainees to the approved research training program, and for the overall direction, management, administration, and evaluation of the program. the pd/pi will be expected to monitor and assess the program and submit all documents and reports as required. the pd/pi has responsibility for the day-to-day administration of the program and is responsible for appointing members of the advisory committee (when applicable), using their recommendations to determine the appropriate allotment of funds.the pd/pi must be a physician and senior faculty member who is knowledgeable about pediatric critical care and/or pediatric trauma research, has a record of success in laboratory and/or clinical investigation, and has demonstrated skill in mentoring and career development. the pd/pi, in consultation with the national advisory committee, shall define the application process, review candidates, make appointments to qualified individuals, and monitor progress.2. cost sharingthis foa does not require cost sharing as defined in the nih grants policy statement.3. additional information on eligibilityonly one application per institution (normally identified by having a unique entity identifier (uei)) is allowed.the nih will not accept duplicate or highly overlapping applications under review at the same time, per 2.3.7.4 submission of resubmission. this means that the nih will not accept:program faculty should have strong records as researchers, including recent publications and successful competition for research support in the area of the proposed research training program. program faculty should also have a record of research training, including successful, former trainees who have established productive careers relevant to the nih mission. researchers from diverse backgrounds, including racial and ethnic minorities, persons with disabilities, and women are encouraged to participate as mentors.scholarsscholars to be supported by the institutional career development program must be at the career level for which the planned program is intended. scholars are expected to devote a minimum of 9 person-months (75% of full-time professional effort) during the appointment on the k12 award.scholars must be citizens or noncitizen nationals of the united states or have been lawfully admitted for permanent residence at the time of appointment. additional details on citizenship requirements are available in the nih grants policy statement.scholars must have received an md or do degree, or its equivalent from an accredited domestic or foreign institution and be fully qualified in postgraduate training for pediatric critical illness or trauma practice. pcctsdp candidates should be physicians who have completed clinical training and must hold junior faculty positions at institutions with academic and research-intensive programs in pediatric critical care and trauma.an individual who has previously served as pd/pi of an nih research grant (e.g., r01, r03, r21, p01), mentored career development award (e.g., k08, k23, k25, k99), subproject of program project (p01), contract (n01), or other equivalent research awards may not be considered as scholars for the pcctsdp. during the period of their appointment, scholars may not accept or hold any other phs award that duplicates the provisions of this career award. however, scholars may remain eligible for other individual mentored career development awards (e.g., k08, k23, k99) at the conclusion of the k12 appointment if additional training is needed to establish research independence. combined support through the k12 and other mentored career development award programs must not exceed six years.prospective scholars should be encouraged to contact potential mentors prior to formally applying to the pcctsdp. although remaining at the institution of their fellowship is a possibility for scholars under this award, broadening academic experience through research career development and clinical practice at a different institution should be strongly encouraged.scholars selected for the program receive two to three years of intense career development training in a basic or clinical science discipline with an established mentor. wherever possible, the program should support career development in those areas of research that would have the greatest potential for a positive effect on the emerging field of pediatric critical care and/or trauma medicine and benefit the growing population of children surviving critical illness and injury. in conjunction with the mentor, the candidate develops a research and career development plan, which will be reviewed annually by the pd/pi and the national advisory committee. at least 9 person-months (75 percent of the scholar's professional effort) must be devoted to research activities supported by the pcctsdp. within the first two years of the program, scholars should seek outside grant support as they transition to independent researcher positions in their sponsoring pediatric critical care medicine or trauma surgery departments and institutions. it is expected that the departments associated with the pcctsdp will make a strong commitment to supporting individuals as they develop their independent research careers.scholars may engage in brief research activities at another institution if the experience is directly related to the purpose of the award.periods of leave from the program for greater than two months, whether for professional or personal reasons, require prior written approval from nih.1. requesting an application

scientific research careers?revisionsrevisionsnot applicableas applicable for the project proposed, reviewers will consider each of the following items, but will not give scores for these items, and should not consider them in providing an overall impact score.recruitment plan to enhance diversitypeer reviewers will separately evaluate the recruitment plan to enhance diversity after the overall score has been determined. reviewers will examine the strategies to be used in the recruitment of prospective individuals from underrepresented groups. the plan will be rated as acceptable or unacceptable, and the consensus of the review committee will be included in an administrative note in the summary statement.training in the responsible conduct of researchall applications for support under this foa must include a plan to fulfill nih requirements for instruction in the responsible conduct of research (rcr). taking into account the specific characteristics of the career development program, the level of scholar experience, and the particular circumstances of the scholars, the reviewers will evaluate the adequacy of the proposed rcr career development in relation to the following five required components: 1) format - does the plan satisfactorily address the format of instruction, e.g., lectures, coursework and/or real-time discussion groups, including face-to-face interaction? (a plan involving only on-line instruction is not acceptable.); 2) subject matter – does the plan include a sufficiently broad selection of subject matter, such as conflict of interest, authorship, data management, human subjects and animal use, laboratory safety, research misconduct, research ethics? 3) faculty participation - does the plan adequately describe how faculty will participate in the instruction? for renewal applications, are all career development faculty who served as course directors, speakers, lecturers, and/or discussion leaders during the past project period named in the application? 4) duration of instruction - does the plan meet the minimum requirements for rcr, i.e., at least eight contact hours of instruction? 5) frequency of instruction – does the plan meet the minimum requirements for rcr, i.e., at least once during each career stage (undergraduate, post-baccalaureate, predoctoral, postdoctoral, and faculty levels) and at a frequency of no less than once every four years?for renewal applications, does the progress report document acceptable rcr instruction in the five components described above? does the plan describe how participation in rcr instruction is being monitored? are appropriate changes in the plan for rcr instruction proposed in response to feedback and in response to evolving issues related to responsible conduct of research?plans and past record will be rated as acceptable or unacceptable, and the summary statement will provide the consensus of the review committee.select agent researchreviewers will assess the information provided in this section of the application, including 1) the select agent(s) to be used in the proposed research, 2) the registration status of all entities where select agent(s) will be
