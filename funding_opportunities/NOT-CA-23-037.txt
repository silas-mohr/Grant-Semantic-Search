(nci)the purpose of this notice of special interest (nosi) is to encourage grant applications for the development of novel technologies to support the needs of cancer control and population sciences research including healthcare delivery research, surveillance research, behavioral research, cancer epidemiology, and population scale -omics research with the goal of driving innovation in this field.backgroundnci administers two unique programs focused on the development of technologies that offer transformative potential for advancing cancer research. the innovative molecular analysis technologies (imat) program supports highly innovative, data-generating platforms and methodologies. the program solicits grant applications for early-stage development of novel tools and methods that enable cancer researchers across the entire spectrum of cancer research. the informatics technologies for cancer research (itcr) program supports powerful data analysis, management, and visualization technologies. the program supports research-driven informatics technology development spanning all aspects of cancer research and across the tool development lifecycle.while nci has been successful in soliciting novel technology development proposals that focus on advancing basic biological research and clinical cancer research, there have been fewer applications received that are specifically aimed at addressing technology gaps that might accelerate research for investigators focused on cancer control and population sciences, including cancer healthcare delivery, surveillance, behavior, epidemiology, and population-scale -omics research.research objectivesthe goal of this nosi is to encourage applications proposing development of novel technologies relevant to cancer control and/or appropriate for population studies. applications in response to this nosi should address topics within the scientific scope of the referenced imat or itcr rfas. research areas of interest for this nosi include but are not limited to:interested parties should thoroughly review all requirements and responsive criteria in the imat and itcr rfas. the imat program requires the inclusion of quantitative performance measures to accompany the aims of any proposed research. applications that fail to include adequate performance measures or are otherwise determined to not be responsive to the rfa requirements will not be reviewed.applications should clearly describe the relevance of the proposed technology to cancer control and population-scale research.application and submission informationthis notice applies to due dates on or after march 01, 2023 and subsequent receipt dates through the expiration date of this notice.submit applications for this initiative using one of the following funding opportunity announcements (foas) or any reissues of these announcement through the expiration date of this notice.all instructions in the sf424 (r&r) application guide and the funding opportunity announcement used for submission must be followed, with the following additions:investigators planning to submit an application in response to this nosi are strongly encouraged to contact and discuss their proposed research/aims with program staff/scientific contacts listed on this nosi well in advance of the application receipt date to better determine appropriateness.applications nonresponsive to terms of this nosi will not be considered for the nosi initiative.scientific/research contact(s)kelly crotty, phd national cancer institute (nci)
