support educational activities that complement and/or enhance the training of a workforce to meet the nation’s biomedical, behavioral and clinical research needs.the nih research education program (r25) supports research education activities in the mission areas of the nih. the overarching goal of this nida r25 program is to support training and educational activities for responsible analyses of complex large-scale data involving brain, behavioral, genomic, and socioenvironmental data that complement and/or enhance the training of a workforce to meet the nation's biomedical, behavioral, and clinical research needs.january 08, 2024all applications are due by 5:00 pm local time of applicant organization.applicants are encouraged to apply early to allow adequate time to make any corrections to errors found in the application during the submission process by the due date.not applicableit is critical that applicants follow the instructions in the research (r) instructions in the sf424 (r&r) application guide, except where instructed to do otherwise (in this foa or in a notice from nih guide for grants and contracts).conformance to all requirements (both in the application guide and the foa) is required and strictly enforced. applicants must read and follow all application instructions in the application guide as well as any program-specific instructions noted in section iv. when the program-specific instructions deviate from those in the application guide, follow the program-specific instructions.applications that do not comply with these instructions may be delayed or not accepted for review.there are several options available to submit your application through grants.gov to nih and department of health and human services partners. you must use one of these submission options to access the application forms for this opportunity.the nih research education program (r25) supports research educational activities that complement other formal training programs in the mission areas of the nih institutes and centers.the overarching goal of this r25 program is to support educational activities that complement and/or enhance the training of a workforce to meet the nation’s biomedical, behavioral and clinical research needs.to accomplish the stated over-arching goal, this foa will support creative educational activities with a primary focus on methodological rigor in the analysis of large complex datasets involving brain, behavior, genomic, and socioenvironmental data. this could involve:background:with the widescale availability of large, open datasets (e.g., human connectome project, the adolescent brain cognitive developmentsm study, the healthy brain and cognitive development study (planned), and the all of us research program), human neuroscience research now frequently includes population-level approaches to understanding brain structure and function and its association with behavior and substance use/mental health outcomes. the wide adoption of such approaches has led to novel insights into fundamental neurocognitive function and accelerated efforts towards understanding risk for and protection from substance use disorder (sud) and other psychiatric outcomes.however, because of the large sample sizes and heterogeneity of these datasets, there is a high likelihood that analyses will produce statistically significant results with small effect sizes that may or may not be clinically or biologically meaningful. responsible use of such data therefore requires knowledge of analytical and statistical considerations specific to large datasets, such as population inference, sampling variability, covariate inclusion, and data missingness. additionally, with the increasing availability of open datasets, many investigators are attempting analyses of large-scale, complex data for the first time and with varied levels of training and knowledge about how to use these large datasets.recently, interest has grown for understanding the social determinants of health or “the societal, environmental, and economic conditions that impact and affect health outcomes” (world health organization commission final report, 2008). with such unprecedented motivation and opportunity to use large scale datasets to study socioenvironmental influences comes a responsibility to incorporate the broader social context and the suitability of the dataset when designing research questions and conducting the analyses. at the same time, it is important to engage communities with lived experiences pertinent to the research questions and the data analyses, and to solicit their input to inform both.taken together, there is an urgent need for research education to help the scientific community understand how to consider study design and statistical analyses in the context of structural socioenvironmental factors.objectives:this funding opportunity announcement (foa) encourages applications that seek to advance methodological rigor in biomedical and behavioral research by supporting training on the responsible analyses of complex, large-scale datasets involving brain, behavioral, genomic, and socioenvironmental data.topics of interest include, but are not limited to:in addition, nida emphasizes responsible analyses of data related to neurodevelopment and neurocognition, as it relates to the substance use trajectory.research education programs may complement ongoing research training and education occurring at the applicant institution, but the proposed educational experiences must be distinct from those training and education programs currently receiving federal support. r25 programs may augment institutional research training programs (e.g., t32, t90) but cannot be used to replace or circumvent ruth l. kirschstein national research service award (nrsa) programs.plan for enhancing diverse perspectives (pedp)this foa requires a plan for enhancing diverse perspectives (pedp) as part of the application (see further below). applicants are strongly encouraged to read the foa instructions carefully and view the available pedp guidance material. applications must include a plan for enhancing diverse perspectives (pedp) submitted as other project information as an attachment (see section iv). the pedp will be assessed as part of the scientific and technical peer review evaluation, as well as considered among programmatic matters with respect to funding decisions.special considerationsnida applicants are strongly encouraged to review the guidelines and adhere to the requirements applicable to their research listed in the special considerations for nida funding opportunities and awards. upon award, these considerations will be included in the notice of grant award.see section viii. other information for award authorities and regulations.grant: a support mechanism providing money, property, or both to an eligible entity to carry out an approved project or activity.not allowed: only accepting applications that do not propose clinical trial(s).need help determining whether you are doing a clinical trial?nida intends to commit $1.5 million in fy 2024 to fund up to 4 awards.application budgets must reflect the actual needs of the proposed project and are limited to $300,000 direct costs per year.the scope of the proposed project should determine the project period. the maximum project period is 3 years.individuals designing, directing, and implementing the research education program may request salary and fringe benefits appropriate for the person months devoted to the program. salaries requested may not exceed the levels commensurate with the institution's policy for similar positions and may not exceed the congressionally mandated cap. (if mentoring interactions and other activities with participants are considered a regular part of an individual's academic duties, then any costs associated with the mentoring and other interactions with participants are not allowable costs from grant funds).for applications proposing courses for skills development: it is recommended that the combined personnel costs (administrative, program coordinator, pd/pi salary support, consultants, and mentor costs) not exceed 30% of the requested direct costs of the grant; exceptions may be considered on a case-by-case basis when justified by the design of the program.for applications proposing courses for skills development:participants may be compensated for participation in activities specifically required by the proposed research education program, if sufficiently justified. participant costs must be itemized in the proposed budget.allowable participant costs depend on the educational level/career status of the individuals to be selected to participate in the program.while generally not an allowable cost, with strong justification, participants in the research education program may receive per diem unless such costs are furnished as part of the registration fee. participants may also receive funds to defray partial tuition and other education-related expenses.expenses for foreign travel must be exceptionally well justified.individuals supported by nih training and career development mechanisms (k, t, or f awards) may receive, and indeed are encouraged to receive, educational experiences supported by an r25 program, as participants, but may not receive salary or stipend supplementation from a research education program.because the r25 program is not intended as a substitute for an nrsa institutional training program (e.g.,t32), costs to support full-time participants (supported for 40 hours/week for a continuous, 12-month period) are not allowable.consultant costs, equipment, supplies, travel for key persons, and other program-related expenses may be included in the proposed budget. these expenses must be justified as specifically required by the proposed program and must not duplicate items generally available at the applicant institution.indirect costs (also known as facilities & administrative [f&a] costs) are reimbursed at 8% of modified total direct costs (exclusive of tuition and fees, expenditures for equipment and consortium costs in excess of $25,000), rather than on the basis of a negotiated rate agreement.nih grants policies as described in the nih grants policy statement will apply to the applications submitted and awards made from this foa.1. eligible applicantshigher education institutionsthe following types of higher education institutions are always encouraged to
