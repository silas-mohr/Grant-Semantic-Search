national institutes of health (nih)national heart, lung, and blood institute (nhlbi)see section iii. 3. additional information on eligibility.the purpose of the nhlbi career transition award (k22) program is to provide highly qualified postdoctoral fellows and other doctoral-level researchers currently in training in the nhlbi division of intramural research with the opportunity to transition their research programs to extramural institutions as junior investigators. to achieve these objectives, the nhlbi career transition award will support two phases of research: a mentored intramural phase (up to two years) and an extramural phase (three years), for a total of five years of combined support. transition from the intramural phase of support to the extramural phase is not automatic. approval of the transition will be based on the success of the awardee's research program during the mentored phase as determined by an nhlbi progress review, which will include an evaluation of a research plan to be carried out at the extramural institution.the purpose of the nhlbi career transition award (k22) program is to provide highly qualified postdoctoral fellows and other

access the application forms for this opportunity.the overall goal of the nih research career development program is to help ensure that a diverse pool of highly trained scientists is available in appropriate scientific disciplines to address the nation's biomedical, behavioral, and clinical research needs. nih institutes and centers (ics) support a variety of mentored and non-mentored career development award programs designed to foster the transition of new investigators to research independence and to support established investigators in achieving specific objectives. candidates should review the different career development (k) award programs to determine the best program to support their goals. more information about career programs may be found at the nih extramural training mechanisms website.the objective of this nhlbi career transition award (k22) is to provide support to outstanding, newly trained basic or clinical investigators to develop their research skills through a two phase program: an initial period involving an intramural position at the nhlbi division of intramural research and a subsequent period of support at an extramural institution. the award facilitates the establishment of a record of independent research by the candidate in order to sustain or promote a successful, independent research career. eligible applicants must be supported by their nhlbi laboratory or branch for the intramural phase of the program. applicants are encouraged to contact the nhlbi scientific/research staff (part 2. section vii) for guidance and additional information.to achieve these objectives, the nhlbi career transition award will support two phases of research. the award will provide up to two years of support for mentored research training in an nhlbi intramural laboratory followed by three years of support for an independent research project in an extramural institution. it is anticipated that awardees will subsequently apply for and obtain funding for research project grants such as the r01 to support the continuation of their work.transition from the intramural phase of support to the extramural phase is not automatic. approval of the transition will be based on the success of the awardee’s research program during the mentored phase as determined by an nhlbi progress review, which will include an evaluation of a research plan to be carried out at the extramural institution.the extramural institution will need to demonstrate a commitment to the candidate by providing protected research time and space needed to perform the proposed research. supplemental funds from the extramural institution for equipment and supplies (and, if necessary, salary) are strongly encouraged. recipients may hold concurrent research support and under certain circumstances salary support during the final two years of their k22 award and a competing nih research project grant when recognized as the pd/pi or subproject director of the research project grant (see not-od-08-065 and not-od-17-094).awardees approved to transition to the second phase of support will receive notification of approval in writing from the nhlbi. information provided by the extramural institution on behalf of the candidate will be required for the nhlbi to process the second phase of the k22.acceptance into the nhlbi career transition award program does not convey any commitment or intent of the nhlbi to consider the awardee for a tenure track position within the nhlbi. the nhlbi career transition award is specifically intended to help develop scientists who will pursue their careers in the extramural biomedical research community. however, the nhlbi k22 awardees are not precluded from applying for available tenure track positions at the nih. if an awardee obtains an nih position, phase 2 of the k22 award will not be activated.nhlbi division of intramural researchthe nhlbi division of intramural research conducts clinical research on the normal and pathophysiologic functioning of the cardiac, pulmonary, blood, and endocrine systems and basic research on normal and abnormal cellular behavior at the molecular level. the research

http://www.hhs.gov/ocr/civilrights/understanding/section1557/index.html.hhs recognizes that research projects are often limited in scope for many reasons that are nondiscriminatory, such as the principal investigator’s scientific interest, funding limitations, recruitment requirements, and other considerations. thus, criteria in research protocols that target or exclude certain populations are warranted where nondiscriminatory justifications establish that such criteria are appropriate with respect to the health or safety of the subjects, the scientific study design, or the purpose of the research. for additional guidance regarding how the provisions apply to nih grant programs, please contact the scientific/research contact that is identified in section vii under agency contacts

federal award making officials to review and consider information about an applicant in the designated integrity and performance system (currently fapiis) prior to making an award. an applicant, at its option, may review information in the designated integrity and performance systems accessible through fapiis and comment on any information about itself that a federal agency previously entered and is currently in fapiis. the federal awarding agency will consider any comments by the applicant, in addition to other information in fapiis, in making a judgement about the applicant’s integrity, business ethics, and record of performance under federal awards when completing the review of risk posed by applicants as described in 45 cfr part 75.205 and 2 cfr part 200.206 “federal awarding agency review of risk posed by applicants.” this provision will apply to all nih grants and cooperative agreements except fellowships.transition to the independent phasetransition from the mentored intramural phase to the independent extramural phase is intended to be continuous in time and, except in unusual, extenuating circumstances, nhlbi will not extend the mentored phase beyond the 2-year limit. exceptions to this time limitation may be considered when individuals have been invited for faculty job interviews but final decisions have not yet been made by the potential extramural institution or, rarely, because of unusual, extenuating circumstances. to activate the independent phase of the grant, individuals must have been offered and accepted a tenure-track, full-time assistant professor position (or equivalent) by the end of the mentored intramural phase of the grant.an eligible extramural institution for the independent phase of the grant will have appropriate infrastructure to support the proposed research program and a history of external research funding. eligibility of for-profit organizations for the extramural phase depends on the nature of the appointment, and the ability of the pd/pi to conduct independent research and apply for nih r01 or r01-equivalent research grants. pis are encouraged to discuss job offers at for-profit organizations with nih program staff well in advance of accepting such an offer.to avoid potential problems in activating the independent phase, applicants are strongly encouraged to contact their nih program official as soon as plans to apply for and, assume an independent position develop, and no later than 6 months prior to the termination of the mentored intramural phase of the award.at that time, individuals should discuss plans for transition to, and application for, the extramural phase with their nih program official. the application for the extramural phase of the award should be submitted no later than 3 months prior to the proposed activation date of the k22 award by the extramural phase grantee organization.the extramural phase institution will submit an application on behalf of the candidate for the k22 award using the phs 398 application. the independent phase application must include:these materials should be sent directly to the nhlbi. the application (preferably in pdf format) is to be emailed to the nhlbi grants management specialist and the nhlbi program official. the application will be evaluated by nhlbi program staff for completeness and appropriateness to the program.two additional documents are included with the extramural phase application. a letter from the department or division chairman must be submitted that describes the extramural institution’s commitment to the candidate and plans for his/her career development (see below), and the final evaluation statement by the intramural phase mentor.in addition to space, facilities, resources, and other support needed to conduct the proposed research, the sponsoring institution must provide protected research time (minimum of 9 person-months: 75% of the candidate’s full time professional effort) at least for the duration of the extramural phase award. the start-up package and other institutional support must be described in detail and must be comparable to that given to other faculty recently hired into tenure-track or equivalent faculty positions. institutions must provide a start-up and salary package equivalent to that provided to a newly hired faculty member who does not have a grant; k22 funds may not be used to offset the typical start-up package or to offset the usual institutional commitment to provide salary for tenure-track (or equivalent) assistant professors who are hired without grant support. the k22 sponsoring institution must describe the candidate’s academic appointment, bearing in mind that it must be tenure-track assistant professor (or equivalent), and confirm that the appointment is not contingent on the transfer of the award to the institution. the extramural phase institution must describe how the awardee’s ability to apply for and secure independent research grant (r01) support will be fostered and supported during the k22 phase of the award. the k22 award requires that a minimum of 9 person-months (75% full time professional effort) be devoted to research activities. consequently, teaching, clinical duties and other non-research activities should be minimal during the k22 award period. nhlbi staff may review start-up packages and other commitments between the institution and candidate prior to activating the independent phase of the award. it is suggested that the applicant and/or the hiring institution discuss the institutional commitment with the relevant program official prior to finalizing the offer. nhlbi will not activate the independent phase if the institutional commitment is deemed inadequate. applicants who are approved to transition will receive a notice of award reflecting the new k22 grant mechanism, the dollar amount, and the new recipient organization.data management and sharingnote:
