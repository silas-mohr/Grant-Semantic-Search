pathway to independence award in tobacco regulatory research (k99/r00) is to increase and maintain a strong cohort of new and talented independent investigators conducting research that will inform the development and evaluation of regulations on tobacco product manufacturing, distribution, and marketing. this program is designed to facilitate a timely transition of outstanding postdoctoral researchers with a research and/or clinical doctorate degree from mentored, postdoctoral research positions to independent, tenure-track or equivalent faculty positions. this program will provide independent nih research support during this transition in order to help awardees launch competitive, independent research careers.research projects must address the research priorities related to the regulatory authority of the food and drug administration (fda) center for tobacco products (ctp) as mandated by the family smoking prevention and tobacco control act (fsptca), public law 111-31.the awards under this foa will be administered by nih using funds made available through the ctp and the fsptca (p.l. 111-31).this funding opportunity announcement (foa) is designed specifically for candidates proposing research that does not involve leading an independent clinical trial, a clinical trial feasibility study, or an ancillary study to a clinical trial. applicants to this foa are permitted to propose research experience in a clinical trial led by a mentor or co-mentor. those proposing a clinical trial or an ancillary clinical trial as lead investigator, should apply to the companion foa (rfa-od-22-026).60 days prior to the application due date. please note, although lois are typically due 30 days before the due date, for this foa lois are due 60 days prior to the application date.all applications are due by 5:00 pm local time of applicant organization.applications are encouraged to apply early to allow adequate time to make any corrections to errors found in the application during the submission process by the due date.not applicableit is critical that applicants follow the instructions in the career development (k) instructions in the sf424 (r&r) application guide, except where instructed to do otherwise (in this foa or in a notice from the nih guide for grants and contracts). conformance to all requirements (both in the application guide and the foa) is required and strictly enforced. applicants must read and follow all application instructions in the application guide as well as any program-specific instructions noted in section iv. when the program-specific instructions deviate from those in the application guide, follow the program-specific instructions. applications that do not comply with these instructions may be delayed or not accepted for review.there are several options available to submit your application through grants.gov to nih and department of health and human services partners. you must use one of these submission options to access the application forms for this opportunity.the overall goal of the nih research career development program is to help ensure that a diverse pool of highly trained scientists is available in appropriate scientific disciplines to address the nation's biomedical, behavioral, and clinical research needs. nih institutes and centers (ics) support a variety of mentored and non-mentored career development award programs designed to foster the transition of new investigators to research independence and to support established investigators in achieving specific objectives. candidates should review the different career development (k) award programs to determine the best program to support their goals. more information about career programs may be found at the nih extramural training mechanisms website.the objective of the nih pathway to independence award (k99/r00) is to help outstanding postdoctoral researchers complete needed, mentored training and transition in a timely manner to independent, tenure-track or equivalent faculty positions. the k99/r00 award is intended to foster the development of a creative, independent research program that will be competitive for subsequent independent funding and that will help advance the mission of the nih. applicants must have no more than 4 years of postdoctoral research experience at the time of the initial or the subsequent resubmission or revision application. the k99/r00 award is intended for individuals who require at least 12 months of mentored research training and career development (k99 phase) before transitioning to the r00 award phase of the program. consequently, the strongest applicants will require, and will propose, a well-conceived plan for 1–2 years of substantive mentored research training and career development that will help them become competitive candidates for tenure-track faculty positions and prepare them to launch robust, independent research programs. an individual who cannot provide a compelling rationale for at least one year of additional mentored research experience and career development at the time of award is not a strong candidate for this award.individuals must be in mentored, postdoctoral training positions to be eligible to apply to the k99/r00 program. if an applicant achieves independence (any faculty or non-mentored research position) before a k99 award is made, neither the k99, nor the r00 award, will be made. the k99/r00 award will provide up to 5 years of support in two phases. the initial (k99) phase will provide support for up to 2 years of mentored postdoctoral research training and career development. the second (r00) phase will provide up to 3 years of independent research support, which is contingent on satisfactory progress during the k99 phase and an approved, independent, tenure-track (or equivalent) faculty position. the two award phases are intended to be continuous in time. therefore, although exceptions may be possible in limited circumstances, r00 awards will generally only be made to those k99 pds/pis who accept independent, tenure-track (or equivalent) faculty positions by the end of the k99 award period.the expectation is that, through this sustained period of research career development and transition, recipients will launch independent research careers in science that informs the regulation of tobacco products and become competitive for new research project grant (r01 or equivalent) funding.backgroundsince 2009, fda has regulated cigarettes, smokeless, and roll-your-own tobacco. fda finalized a rule, effective august 8, 2016, to regulate all tobacco products including electronic nicotine delivery systems or ends (e.g., vapes, vaporizers, vape pens, hookah pens, electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes or e-cigs), and e-pipes), cigars, pipe tobacco, gels, hookah (waterpipe) tobacco, and future tobacco products. tobacco products are subject to provisions outlined in the fd&c act. fda also has the authority to develop tobacco product standards, when appropriate for the protection of public health.a full description of the fsptca can be found at: https://www.fda.gov/tobacco-products/rules-regulations-and-guidance/family-smoking-prevention-and-tobacco-control-act-table-contentsprogram scope and research objectivesthe fda and nih share interest in supporting research that could inform fda's tobacco regulatory authorities. to that end, the research encouraged by this foa is expected to provide additional scientific data to the research base to inform regulation of tobacco products to protect public health. although a vast and sound science base exists with regard to numerous areas related to the fsptca, new research will provide additional science for the fda to consider as it implements the fsptca.consistent with the fda ctp mission, this foa encourages research applications that address such scientific domains as: 1) understanding the composition and design of tobacco products, 2) approaches that test the toxicity of tobacco smoke, aerosol, or specific constituents, 3) the effect of tobacco product characteristics on addiction and abuse liability, 4) the short- and long-term health effects of tobacco products, 5) understanding the knowledge, attitudes, perceptions, and behaviors related to tobacco product use, 6) understanding how to effectively communicate the health effects of tobacco products use, 7) the influences of tobacco marketing, and 8) understanding the impact of potential fda regulatory actions.where appropriate to the research question, applications may focus on populations or groups that bear disproportionate burden of tobacco product risk and harm. if a population experiencing tobacco-related disparities will be included, applicants will be expected to identify the population and how the population is important to the research question, considering the impact on population health. populations can include (but are not limited to):youth and young adultsthose from lower socioeconomic backgrounds (e.g., those with lower household incomes or lower educational attainment)racial or ethnic minoritiessexual and/or gender minoritiesrural populationsthose pregnant or trying to become pregnantactive-duty military or veteransthose who are or have been incarceratedthose with mental health conditions or substance use disordersscientific domainsproduct composition and design– understanding the chemical constituents in tobacco products and the methods for measuring them across products with diverse characteristics*. priorities include:toxicity – understanding how tobacco products and changes to tobacco product characteristics* affect their potential to cause morbidity and mortality in users and nonusers through secondary exposure; including animal (in vivo) and cell culture (in vitro) models, as well as novel alternative toxicology approaches that test the toxicity of tobacco smoke (other than cigarette), aerosols, or specific constituents in tobacco and the tobacco product. priorities include:addiction – understanding the effect of tobacco product characteristics* on addiction and abuse liability across populations. priorities include:health effects – understanding the short- and long-term health effects of tobacco products (excluding conventional cigarettes) with priority on longitudinal data. areas of interest include cardiovascular, cancer, neurological (e.g., seizures), oral, reproductive, and respiratory health effects (including inflammation and lung disorders (e.g., asthma, copd). priorities include:behavior – understanding the knowledge, attitudes, perceptions, and behaviors related to tobacco product use and the impact of tobacco product characteristics* on behaviors across populations, as appropriate. priorities include:communications – understanding how to effectively communicate to the public regarding nicotine and the health effects of tobacco products through media campaigns and digital media. priorities include:marketing influences – understanding the impact of marketing on susceptibility to and initiation of using tobacco products (both classes of products and products within classes) and transitions between experimentation, initiation, regular use, product switching, dual use, and cessation-related behaviors among different populations. topics may include marketing such as advertising, digital media, and promotions. priorities include:impact analysis– understanding the potential or actual impact of fda regulatory actions. priorities include:*the term “characteristic” encompasses materials, ingredients (including additives, nicotine formulations, and flavors), design, composition, heating source, and other features of a tobacco product, including harmful and potentially harmful constituents. product characteristics can be incorporated into all the above topics.non-responsive researchalthough the following research topics may be within fda ctp’s regulatory authorities to fund, they are not to be included in the foa and will be deemed non-responsive:projects must propose research aims that are within the regulatory authority of fda ctp and the scientific interest areas identified in this foa in order to be considered responsive to this foa. as such, investigators are strongly encouraged to discuss whether their application is responsive to this foa with a scientific/research contact listed in section vii prior to submission of their application, and to review additional information available including research priorities, a frequently asked questions document and the k01 and k99/r00 mechanisms fact sheet found at:

tobacco regulatory research and/or career development conference will be organized by nih and fda, with the timing of the conference at the discretion of the government. funds from the award must be used for this travel.note: this funding opportunity announcement (foa) is designed specifically for applicants proposing research that does not involve leading an independent clinical trial, a clinical trial feasibility study, or an ancillary clinical trial. applicants to this foa are permitted to propose research experience in a clinical trial led by a mentor or co-mentor. applicants proposing a clinical trial or an ancillary study to an ongoing clinical trial as lead investigator, should apply to the companion foa (rfa-od-22-026).see section viii. other information for award authorities and regulations.grant: a support mechanism providing money, property, or both to an eligible entity to carry out an approved project or activity.not allowed: only accepting applications that do not propose clinical trials.note: applicants may propose to gain experience in a clinical trial led by a mentor/co-mentor as part of their research career development.the awards under this foa will be administered by nih using designated funds from the fda ctp for tobacco regulatory science.fda intends to commit $750,000 to support 5 awards for both this foa (pathway to independence award in tobacco regulatory research (k99/r00 - independent clinical trial not allowed) and the companion foa (pathway to independence award in tobacco regulatory research (k99/r00 - independent clinical trial required). awards are contingent upon funds available from the fda and the submission of a sufficient number of meritorious applications.fda ctp will contribute up to $90,000 per year toward the salary plus applicable fringe of the career award recipient. further guidance on budgeting for career development salaries is provided in the sf424 (r&r) application guide. see also not-od-17-094extramural: mentored candidates at an extramural sponsoring institution/organization will be supported by nih extramural funds. the requested salary must be consistent both with the established salary structure at the institution and with salaries actually provided by the institution from its own funds to other staff members with equivalent qualifications, rank, and responsibilities in the department concerned. further guidance on budgeting for career development salaries is provided in the sf424 (r&r) application guide.the total salary may not exceed the legislatively mandated salary cap.see: https://grants.nih.gov/grants/policy/salcap_summary.htm.independent phase (r00) the total cost for the independent phase (r00) may not exceed $249,000 per year. this amount includes salary, fringe benefits, research costs, and applicable indirect costs. indirect costs will be reimbursed at the extramural sponsoring institution’s indirect cost rate. indirect costs requested by consortium participants are included in the total cost limitation.fda ctp will contribute $60,000 per year toward the research development costs of the award recipient, which must be justified and consistent with the stage of development of the candidate and the proportion of time to be spent in research or career development activities.research expenses may include (a) tuition and fees related to career development activities; (b) supplies, equipment, and technical personnel; c) travel to research and grantee meetings or training organized by the nih and fda on tobacco regulatory research. funds from the award must be used for this travel, and (d) statistical services, including personnel and computer time.salary for mentors, secretarial and administrative assistants, etc. is not allowed.1. eligible applicantshigher education institutionsthe following types of higher education institutions are always encouraged to apply for nih support as public or private institutions of higher education:nonprofits other than institutions of higher educationfor-profit organizationsgovernmentsotherthe sponsoring institution may be private (profit or nonprofit) or public. the applicant institution will be the mentored phase (k99) institution. all institution/organization types listed above are eligible for both the mentored (k99) and independent (r00) phase. eligibility of organizations, other than institutions of higher education, for the r00 phase depends on the nature of the appointment, and the ability of the pd/pi to conduct independent tobacco regulatory science research and apply for nih research (r01 or r01-equivalent) grants.non-domestic (non-u.s.) entities (foreign institutions) are not eligible to apply.non-domestic (non-u.s.) components of u.s. organizations are not eligible to apply.foreign components, as defined in the nih grants policy statement, are not allowed.applicant organizationsapplicant organizations must complete and maintain the following registrations as described in the sf 424 (r&r) application guide to be eligible to apply for or receive an award. all registrations must be completed prior to the application being submitted. registration can take 6 weeks or more, so applicants should begin the registration process as soon as possible. the nih policy on late submission of grant applications states that failure to complete registrations in advance of a due date is not a valid reason for a late submission.program directors/principal investigators (pd(s)/pi(s))all pd(s)/pi(s) must have an era commons account. pd(s)/pi(s) should work with their organizational officials to either create a new account or to affiliate their existing account with the applicant organization in era commons. if the pd/pi is also the organizational signing official, they must have two distinct era commons accounts, one for each role. obtaining an era commons account can take up to 2 weeks.all pd(s)/pi(s) must be registered with orcid. the personal profile associated with the pd(s)/pi(s) era commons account must be linked to a valid orcid id. for more information on linking an orcid id to an era commons personal profile see the orcid topic in our era commons online help.any candidate with the skills, knowledge, and resources necessary to carry out the proposed research as the program director/principal investigator (pd/pi) is invited to work with his/her mentor and organization to develop an application for support. individuals from underrepresented racial and ethnic groups, individuals with disabilities, and women are always encouraged to apply for nih support. see, reminder: notice of nih's encouragement of applications supporting individuals from underrepresented ethnic and racial groups as well as individuals with disabilities, not-od-22-019. multiple pds/pis are not allowed.k99/r00 applicants must have no more than 4 years of postdoctoral research experience as of the relevant application due date regardless of whether it is a new or resubmission application. individuals must be in mentored, postdoctoral training positions to be eligible to apply to the k99/r00 program. if an applicant achieves independence (i.e., any faculty or non-mentored research position) before a k99 award is made, neither the k99 award, nor the r00 award, will be issued.consistent with the nih extension policy for early stage investigator status (esi), nih will approve an extension of one year for childbirth within the 4 year k99 eligibility window. applicants who will be pd/pis on a k99 application must provide the child’s date of birth in the extension request justification submitted to ic program officials and/or scientific/research contacts listed in the foa at least 12 weeks before submitting an application.in addition, parental, medical, military, or other well-justified leave for personal or family situations of generally less than 12 months duration is typically not included in the 4-year eligibility limit, nor is clinical training with no research involvement (e.g., full-time residency training). only time dedicated to research activities counts toward the 4-year limit. part-time postdoctoral research training, related to personal or family situations or occurring during a research residency or fellowship, will be pro-rated accordingly.additional clarifications are provided under frequently asked questions. potential candidates are encouraged to discuss their individual situation with an nih institute or center scientific program contact before applying.there is no citizenship requirement for k99 applicants. an applicant may be a citizen or a non-citizen national of the united states, have been lawfully admitted for permanent residence (i.e., possess a currently valid permanent resident card uscis form i-551, or other legal verification of such status), or be a non-u.s. citizen.for applications submitted on behalf of non-u.s. citizens with temporary u.s. visas, visa status during each phase of the k99/r00 award must allow the pd/pi to conduct the proposed research at the applicant institution. for the k99 phase of the award, the applicant institution is responsible for determining and documenting, in the k99 application, that the candidate’s visa will allow him or her to remain in the u.s. long enough to complete the k99 phase of the award. for the r00 phase of the award, the u.s institution at which the r00 phase of the award will be conducted is responsible for determining and documenting, in the r00 application, that the pd/pi’s visa will allow the pd/pi to remain in the u.s. for the duration of the r00 award.candidates for the k99/r00 award must have a clinical or research doctorate (including phd, md, do, dc, nd, dds, dmd, dvm, scd, dns, pharmd or equivalent doctoral degrees). clinicians (including those with md, dds, dvm and other licensed health professionals) in a clinical faculty position that denotes independence in clinical responsibilities but not in research may also be eligible for the k99/r00 award. individuals are not eligible if they:ph.d. (or equivalent research doctorate degree) candidates in positions other than postdoctoral fellow positions: it is recognized that some institutions appoint postdoctoral fellows in positions with other titles although they are still in non-independent, mentored training positions. candidates in such positions are encouraged to obtain confirmation of their eligibility from the relevant ic before they begin to prepare their applications. it is incumbent upon the candidate to provide evidence that his or her position complies with the intent of this eligibility requirement. if a potential applicant is in a position that is not clearly identifiable as a postdoctoral training position, candidate should provide the relevant nih institute or center an official statement of the institution’s policy (e.g. published position description in an official institutional document) which documents the position as a mentored, postdoctoral training position. clinicians (including those with m.d., d.d.s, d.v.m. and other licensed professionals) in positions not designated as postdoctoral positions: following clinical training or fellowship training periods, clinicians often obtain a clinical faculty position that denotes independence in clinical responsibilities but not in research. a clinical faculty member who does not hold an independent research faculty position may be eligible for the k99/r00 award, and should contact a program director at the relevant nih institute for guidance. clinicians in such positions are encouraged to obtain confirmation of their eligibility before they begin to prepare their applications. such individuals may also wish to consider other career awards (see k kiosk) available for junior faculty development. the following is provided as an aid to distinguish independent from non-independent positions: however, it is not sufficient merely to cite one or more of the following items to document eligibility. evidence for non-independence may include:conversely, evidence for independence, and therefore lack of eligibility, includes:2. cost sharing3. additional information on eligibilityapplicant organizations may submit more than one application, provided that each application is scientifically distinct, and each is from a different candidate.the nih will not accept duplicate or highly overlapping applications under review at the same time per 2.3.7.4 submission of resubmission application. an individual may not have two or more competing nih career development applications pending review concurrently. in addition, nih will not accept:at the time of award, the candidate must have a “full-time” appointment at the academic institution. candidates are required to commit a minimum of 75% of full-time professional effort (i.e., a minimum of 9 person-months) to their program of career development. candidates may engage in other duties as part of the remaining 25% of their full-time professional effort not covered by this award, as long as such duties do not interfere with or detract from the proposed career development program.candidates who have va appointments may not consider part of the va effort toward satisfying the full time requirement at the applicant institution. candidates with va appointments should contact the staff person in the relevant institute or center prior to preparing an application to discuss their eligibility.after the receipt of the award, adjustments to the required level of effort may be made in certain circumstances. see not-od-18-156 and nih grants policy statement, section 12.3.6.4 temporary adjustments to the percent effort requirement for more detailsr00 phase. although candidates are required to devote no less than 75% of their full-time, 12-month professional effort to research (i.e., full-time for 9 person-months), the required 9 person-months of research effort need not be devoted exclusively to the r00-supported research.mentor(s)before submitting the application, the candidate must identify a mentor(s) who will supervise the proposed career development and research experience. candidates are encouraged to identify more than one mentor, i.e., a mentoring team, if this is deemed advantageous for providing expert advice in all aspects of the research career development program. in such cases, one individual must be identified as the primary mentor who will coordinate the candidate’s research. at least one member of the supervisory mentoring team must have expertise in the field of tobacco research as it relates to the regulation of tobacco products and fda's regulatory authorities. the mentor, or a member of the mentoring team, should have a successful track record of mentoring individuals at the candidate’s career stage. the candidate must work with the mentor(s) in preparing the application. the mentor should be an active investigator in the area of the proposed research and be committed both to the career development of the candidate and to the direct supervision of the candidate’s research. the mentor must document the availability of sufficient research support and facilities for high-quality research. where feasible, women, individuals from underrepresented racial and ethnic groups, and individuals with disabilities should be involved as mentors to serve as role models.the applicant institution must have a strong, well-established record of research and career development activities and faculty qualified to serve as mentor(s) in biomedical, behavioral, or clinical research. the institution must demonstrate a commitment to the development of the candidate as a productive, independent investigator with research projects that address research priorities related to the regulatory authority of the food and drug administration (fda) center for tobacco products (ctp) as mandated by the family smoking prevention and tobacco control act (fsptca), public law 111-31. the institution must also be willing to allow the protected time needed by the candidate. the candidate, mentor(s), and institution must describe a research career development program that will maximize the use of this environment, including available facilities and resources.1. requesting an application packagebuttons to access the online assist system or to download application forms are available

organization successfully compete for an award, recipients of federal financial assistance (ffa) from hhs must administer their programs in compliance with federal civil rights laws that prohibit discrimination on the basis of race, color, national origin, disability, age and, in some circumstances, religion, conscience, and sex (including gender identity, sexual orientation, and pregnancy). this includes ensuring programs are accessible to persons with limited english proficiency and persons with disabilities. the hhs office for civil rights provides guidance on complying with civil rights laws enforced by hhs. please see https://www.hhs.gov/civil-rights/for-providers/provider-obligations/index.html https://www.hhs.gov/civil-rights/for-individuals/nondiscrimination/index.htmlhhs recognizes that research projects are often limited in scope for many reasons that are nondiscriminatory, such as the principal investigator’s scientific interest, funding limitations, recruitment requirements, and other considerations. thus, criteria in research protocols that target or exclude certain populations are warranted where nondiscriminatory justifications establish that such criteria are appropriate with respect to the health or safety of the subjects, the scientific study design, or the purpose of the research. for additional guidance regarding how the provisions apply to nih grant programs, please contact the scientific/research contact that is identified in section vii under agency contacts of this foa.recipients of ffa must ensure that their programs are

1-800-537-7697.in accordance with the statutory provisions contained in section 872 of the duncan hunter national defense authorization act of fiscal year 2009 (public law 110-417), nih awards will be subject to the federal awardee performance and integrity information system (fapiis) requirements. fapiis requires federal award making officials to review and consider information about an applicant in the designated integrity and performance system (currently fapiis) prior to making an award. an applicant, at its option, may review information in the designated integrity and performance systems accessible through fapiis and comment on any information about itself that a federal agency previously entered and is currently in fapiis. the federal awarding agency will consider any comments by the applicant, in addition to other information in fapiis, in making a judgement about the applicant’s integrity, business ethics, and record of performance under federal awards when completing the review of risk posed by applicants as described in 45 cfr part 75.205 and 2 cfr part 200.206 “federal awarding agency review of risk posed by applicants.” this provision will apply to all nih grants and cooperative agreements except fellowships.transition to the independent phasetransition from the mentored phase to the independent phase is intended to be continuous in time and, except in unusual, extenuating circumstances, the awarding nih institute/center will not extend the k99 phase beyond the 2-year limit. ics may, at their discretion, make exceptions to this time limitation when individuals have been invited for faculty job interviews but final decisions have not yet been made by the potential r00 institution or, rarely, because of unusual, extenuating circumstances. to activate the independent phase of the grant, individuals must have been offered and accepted a tenure-track, full-time assistant professor position (or equivalent) by the end of the k99 project period.an eligible r00 institution will have appropriate infrastructure to support the proposed research program and a history of external research funding. k99 recipients are free to apply for independent phase positions within the nih intramural research program (irp). however, should the individual accept such a position in the irp, the independent phase of the award will not be activated. this is because nih intramural scientists are supported directly by nih intramural funds and are not eligible for nih extramural grant awards. eligibility of for-profit organizations for the r00 phase depends on the nature of the appointment, and the ability of the pd/pi to conduct independent research and apply for nih r01 or r01-equivalent research grants. pis are encouraged to discuss job offers at for-profit organizations with nih program staff well in advance of accepting such an offer.to avoid potential problems in activating the independent phase, recipients are strongly encouraged to contact their nih program official as soon as plans to apply for and, assume an independent position develop, and not later than 6 months prior to the termination of the k99 phase of the award.at that time, individuals should discuss plans for transition to, and application for, the r00 phase with their nih program official. the application for the r00 phase of the award should be submitted no later than 2 months prior to the proposed activation date of the r00 award by the r00 phase recipient organization.the independent phase institution will submit an application on behalf of the candidate for the r00 award using the phs 398 application. the r00 application must include:these materials should be sent directly to the awarding institute or center (ic). the original application plus one copy (preferably in pdf format) are to be mailed (or e-mailed) to the financial or grants management contact person of the awarding nih institute or center listed in the notice of award. the r00 application will be evaluated by extramural program staff of the awarding component for completeness and appropriateness to the program.two additional documents are included with the r00 application. a letter from the r00 department or division chairman must be submitted that describes the r00 institution’s commitment to the candidate and plans for his/her career development (see below). if not already provided, the final evaluation statement by the k99 phase mentor, must be provided.in addition to space, facilities, resources, and other support needed to conduct the proposed research, the sponsoring institution must provide protected research time (minimum of 9 person-months or 75% of the candidate’s full time professional effort) at least for the duration of the r00 award. the start-up package and other institutional support must be described in detail and must be comparable to that given to other faculty recently hired into tenure-track or equivalent faculty positions. institutions must provide a startup and salary package equivalent to that provided to a newly hired faculty member who does not have a grant; r00 funds may not be used to offset the typical startup package or to offset the usual institutional commitment to provide salary for tenure-track (or equivalent) assistant professors who are hired without grant support. the r00 sponsoring institution must describe the candidate’s academic appointment, bearing in mind that it must be tenure-track assistant professor (or equivalent), and confirm that the appointment is not contingent on the transfer of the award to the institution. the r00 phase institution must describe how the recipient’s ability to apply for and secure independent research grant (r01) support will be fostered and supported during the r00 phase of the award.the r00 award requires that a minimum of 9 person months (75% of the candidate’s full time professional effort) be devoted to research activities. consequently, teaching, clinical duties and other non-research activities should be minimal during the r00 award period. nih staff may review start-up packages and other commitments between the institution and candidate prior to activating the independent phase of the award. it is suggested that the applicant and/or the hiring institution discuss the institutional commitment with the relevant nih institute program official prior to finalizing the offer. nih will not activate the independent phase if the institutional commitment is deemed inadequate. recipients who are approved to transition will receive a notice of award reflecting the new r00 grant mechanism, the dollar amount, and the new recipient organization (if applicable).the k99/r00 award is intended to facilitate successful transition to independence. consequently, a requirement for activation of the r00 phase is successful completion of this transition. k99 recipients are encouraged (but not required) to apply for independent positions at departments and institutions different from where they conducted their mentored research. it is important for all recipients, but especially so for those who intend to stay at the mentored phase institution for the independent phase, to provide a plan by which they will separate from their mentor and advance to independence. recipients are also encouraged to include a plan and timeline for submitting an independent research grant application in a research area relevant to the mission of an nih awarding component.candidates who are not approved to transition will receive written notification from the awarding component communicating the rationale for the disapproval. this notification typically will be sent within 60 days of receipt of the r00 application.although the financial plans of the nih institute or center provide support for this program, awards pursuant to this funding opportunity are contingent upon the availability of funds.termination of the k99 award phaseif transition from the k99 phase at an extramural institution to the r00 phase occurs at the originally scheduled end date of the k99 award, then no specific steps to terminate the k99 award are necessary. if the transition at an extramural institution occurs prior to the scheduled end date, then a revised notice of award will be issued to terminate the k99 phase award. carry-over of unspent funds from a partially completed year in the k99 phase into the r00 phase may be permitted.data management and sharingnote: the nih policy for data management and sharing is effective for due dates on or after january 25, 2023.consistent with the nih policy for data management and sharing, when data management and sharing is applicable to the award, recipients will be required to adhere to the data management and sharing requirements as outlined in the nih grants policy statement. upon the approval of a data management and sharing plan, it is required for recipients to implement the plan as described.3. reportingwhen multiple years are involved, recipients will be required to submit the research performance progress report (rppr) annually and financial statements as required in the nih grants policy statement. the supplemental instructions for individual career development (k) rpprs must be followed. for mentored awards, the mentor’s report must include an annual evaluation statement of the candidate’s progress.a mid-period progress report will be due every six (6) months following the project start date, as well as the annual progress report. electronic copies should be sent to the grants management specialist listed on the notice of grant award. the scientific summary should be a maximum of two (2) pages.a final rppr, invention statement, and the expenditure data portion of the federal financial report are required for closeout of an award, as described in the nih grants policy statement.the federal funding accountability and transparency act of 2006 (transparency act), includes a requirement for recipients of federal grants to report information about first-tier subawards and executive compensation under federal assistance awards issued in fy2011 or later. all recipients of applicable nih grants and cooperative agreements are required to report to the federal subaward reporting system (fsrs) available at www.fsrs.gov on all subawards over the threshold. see the nih grants policy statement for additional information on this reporting requirement.in accordance with the regulatory requirements provided at 45 cfr 75.113 and 2 cfr part 200.113 and appendix xii to 45 cfr part 75 and 2 cfr part 200, recipients that have currently active federal grants, cooperative agreements, and procurement contracts from all federal awarding agencies with a cumulative total value greater than $10,000,000 for any period of time during the period of performance of a federal award, must report and maintain the currency of information reported in the system for award management (sam) about civil, criminal, and administrative proceedings in connection with the award or performance of a federal award that reached final disposition within the most recent five-year period. the recipient must also make semiannual disclosures regarding such proceedings. proceedings information will be made publicly available in the designated integrity and performance system (currently fapiis). this is a statutory requirement under section 872 of public law 110-417, as amended (41 u.s.c. 2313). as required by section 3010 of public law 111-212, all information posted in the designated integrity and performance system on or after april 15, 2011, except past performance reviews required for federal procurement contracts, will be publicly available. full reporting requirements and procedures are found in appendix xii to 45 cfr part 75 and 2 cfr part 200 – award term and condition for
