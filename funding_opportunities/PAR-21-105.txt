opportunitypar-21-104 - international research scientist development award (irsda) (k01) independent clinical trial not allowedsee section iii. 3. additional information on eligibility.93.989, 93.398the purpose of the international research scientist development award (irsda) is to provide support and protected time (three to five years) to advanced postdoctoral u.s. research scientists and recently-appointed u.s. junior faculty (applicants must be at least two years beyond conferral of doctoral degree) for an intensive, mentored research career development experience in a low- or middle-income country (lmic), as defined by the world bank (http://data.worldbank.org/about/country-classifications/country-and-lending-groups), including "low-income," "lower-middle-income," and "upper-middle-income" countries) leading to an independently-funded research career focused on global health. this funding opportunity announcement (foa) invites applications from postdoctoral research scientists and junior faculty from any health-related discipline who propose career development activities and a research project that is relevant to the health priorities of the lmic under the mentorship of lmic and u.s. mentors.this funding opportunity announcement (foa) is designed specifically for applicants proposing to serve as the lead investigator of an independent clinical trial, a clinical trial feasibility study, or a separate ancillary clinical trial, as part of their research and career development. applicants not planning an independent clinical trial, or proposing to gain research experience in a clinical trial led by another investigator, must apply to companion foa (par-21-104).not applicablemarch 9, 2021; march 9, 2022; march 8 2023 by 5:00 pm local time of

2023not applicablewe encourage inquiries concerning this funding opportunity and welcome the opportunity to answer questions from potential applicants.the objective of the nih mentored research scientist development award (k01) is to provide salary and research support for a sustained period of “protected time” (3-5 years) for intensive research career development, under the guidance of an experienced mentor, or sponsor in the biomedical, behavioral or clinical sciences leading to research independence. the expectation is that, through this sustained period of research career development and training, awardees will launch independent research careers and become competitive for new research project grant (e.g., r01) funding.program descriptionopportunities to advance global health research careers are central to building a robust global health workforce, yet it remains a challenge for researchers to establish independent international research careers given the requisite time spent away from their home institutions. prolonged field experience is critical for global health research and for establishing sustained research partnerships, but gaining this field experience can be difficult for junior faculty, who are balancing administrative and teaching requirements, or for individuals in standard postdoctoral positions. the international research scientist development award (irsda) program addresses this need and fills an important global health career development gap. the irsda program provides opportunities to conduct mentored global health research in low- and middle-income country (lmic) settings and to foster long-term research collaborations that strengthen global health research.the objective of the irsda program is to prepare qualified advanced postdoctoral research scientists and recently-appointed junior faculty (see eligible individuals) for research careers that will have a significant impact on the health-related research needs of lmics. irsda awardees will conduct their research and career development activities under the guidance of experienced u.s.-based and lmic-based mentors, in any health-related discipline that is relevant to the health priorities of the lmic.awardees must spend a minimum of 50% of the cumulative effort over the project period (all years) physically in-country conducting collaborative research at the lmic institution. in addition, in each year of the award, the recipient must spend a minimum of three months in the lmic (see in-country requirement under eligible individuals in section iii). awardees are expected to gain increased capabilities in collaborative research (i.e. team science) skills in low-resource settings, advanced research methodology, analysis and data management, research administrative skills, responsible conduct of research, scientific presentation, and manuscript and grant writing. through this program, it is expected that awardees will launch independent global health research careers, continue to collaborate with lmic scientists on research that addresses the health needs of their countries, and become competitive for new research project grant (e.g., r01) funding in global health.lmics are defined by the world bank classification system (according to gross national income (gni) per capita as "low-income," "lower-middle-income," and "upper-middle-income" (http://data.worldbank.org/about/country-classifications/country-and-lending-groups).interests of participating nih institutes and centersthe fogarty international center (fic) is interested in applications from individuals seeking to become independent investigators and global health research leaders in any therapeutic or scientific area of health priority and scientific importance to the lmic. fic is dedicated to advancing the mission of the nih by supporting and facilitating global health research conducted by u.s. and international investigators, building
