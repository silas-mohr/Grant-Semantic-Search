opportunity announcement (foa) solicits applications for the early-stage development of therapeutics to mitigate the adverse health effects resulting from toxic chemical exposure. chemical threats are toxic compounds that could be used in a terrorist attack or accidentally released from industrial production, storage or shipping. they include specific chemical warfare agents, toxic industrial chemicals, pesticides, and pharmaceutical-based agents. the overall scope of this solicitation includes validation of therapeutic targets and preclinical characterization of lead compounds. the ug3 phase of this foa supports target validation and characterization of initial lead compound(s); uh3 phase activities include candidate optimization and in vivo demonstration of activity and efficacy in relevant post-exposure models. at the conclusion of the overall ug3/uh3 funding period, projects are expected to deliver at least one well-characterized therapeutic candidate.30 days prior to application due dateall applications are due by 5:00 pm local time of applicant organization.applicants are encouraged to apply early to allow adequate time to make any corrections to errors found in the application during the submission process by the due date.not applicableit is critical that applicants follow the instructions in the research (r) instructions in the sf424 (r&r) application guide, except where instructed to do otherwise (in this foa or in a notice from nih guide for grants and contracts).conformance to all requirements (both in the application guide and the foa) is required and strictly enforced. applicants must read and follow all application instructions in the application guide as well as any program-specific instructions noted in section iv. when the program-specific instructions deviate from those in the application guide, follow the program-specific instructions.applications that do not comply with these instructions may be delayed or not accepted for review.there are several options available to submit your application through grants.gov to nih and department of health and human services partners. you must use one of these submission options to access the application forms for this opportunity.overviewthe chemical countermeasures research program (ccrp) supports the discovery and early development of medical countermeasures (mcms) to treat and/or prevent serious morbidities and mortality resulting from high consequence public health chemical emergencies. a high consequence public health chemical event is when a large number of civilians are either deliberately or accidentally exposed to highly toxic chemicals. in this case, the mcms should be easily accessible to first responders and local public health authorities for use in a mass casualty pre-hospital setting and they should be safe and effective for adults, children, and the elderly or as follow-on treatments in-hospital, when appropriate. the civilian chemical threat spectrum includes chemical warfare agents, toxic industrial chemicals, pesticides, pharmaceutical-based agents, and others that have been identified by the united states government (usg) as chemicals of concern (coc). these compounds are highly toxic and mcms are urgently needed to advance national medical and public health preparedness for, response to, and recovery from, chemical emergencies.the ccrp is a trans-nih initiative established by the niaid in 2006 and involves partnerships with the nei, niams, nichd, niehs, nida, and ninds nih institutes to execute the overall nih strategic plan and research agenda for medical countermeasures against chemical threats. within the ccrp, the nih countermeasures against chemical threats (counteract) program led by the ninds in collaboration with the other ccrp institutes supports research focused on civilian chemical mcms. the nih collaborates closely with sister federal agencies, such as the biomedical advanced research and development authority (barda) under the public health emergency medical countermeasures enterprise (phemce) to support the advanced research and development of promising mcms.projects funded under this foa are expected to deliver a characterized therapeutic candidate at the conclusion of the overall ug3/uh3 funding period.a characterized therapeutic candidate, including repurposing of therapeutics for other indications, is a small molecule or biologic that is biologically active and synthetically feasible, where specificity, affinity, potency, target selectivity, pharmacokinetics/ pharmacodynamics, safety and post-exposure efficacy have been established. this includes demonstration of acceptable absorption, distribution, metabolism, elimination, toxicity (admet) profile, in vivo efficacy, and validated target engagement for the proposed indication with clinically relevant results. for guidance on studies and metrics to identify a lead therapeutic candidate see the early drug discovery and development guidelines: for academic researchers, collaborators, and start-up companies.chemicals of concern (coc)the following chemicals of concern (coc) identified by the department of homeland security are organized within toxidromes established by the usg. toxidromes group chemicals based on their primary modes of toxicity. one benefit of this approach is that a single mcm with broad spectrum activity can be used to treat multiple different chemical threats. the coc toxidromes (with examples) are:anticoagulants (e.g., brodifacoum, bromadiolone)blood agents (e.g., hydrogen cyanide, hydrogen sulfide)cholinergic warfare and pesticides (e.g., sarin, soman, parathion, phorate, aldicarb)convulsant (e.g., picrotoxin, tets, strychnine)hemolytic/metabolic (e.g., arsenic trioxide, thallium sulfate, arsine)pulmonary (e.g., chlorine, phosgene, sulfur mustard, ammonia, sulfur dioxide)synthetic opioids (e.g., fentanyl, carfentanil, acetylfentanyl, sufentanil, remifentanil)vesicants (e.g., sulfur and nitrogen mustard, lewisite, phosgene oxime)the above list of chemicals of concern are examples, the list is not limited only to these chemicals. only projects that include chemicals that have been identified by the dhs as coc will be supported by this foa. applicants are strongly encouraged to contact the scientific/research contacts provided in this foa to confirm that the proposed chemical threat(s) is of interest to the program.scientific scope/research topicsthis foa will only support research that is clearly relevant to the development of mcms that will enhance national medical response capabilities during or after a large-scale chemical emergency. the scientific scope of this foa in the ug3 phase includes target validation and characterization of preliminary candidate(s); uh3 phase activities include candidate optimization and non-glp in vivo demonstration of activity and efficacy in relevant post-exposure models. efficacy of the lead candidate therapeutic must be demonstrated in an appropriate model predictive of the human response in a mass casualty/ emergency setting, including an extended post-exposure treatment window and route of administration. prophylactic therapeutic approaches that are administered before chemical threat exposure, are considered non-responsive to this foa, and will not be reviewed as they to do not have practical utility during a mass casualty event.in all cases, the proposed research must address acute exposures, not chronic exposures over a long period, e.g., environmental, occupational or residential exposures.research relevant to this foa:minimum foa entry criteria:for projects that are proposing to repurpose fda-approved drugs, many of the above entry criteria may already be met.the ug3/uh3 funding mechanismthis foa will use the ug3/uh3 cooperative agreement mechanism. as translational research is inherently high-risk, this mechanism uses milestones that will provide clear indicators of a project's continued success or emergent difficulties.this mechanism will utilize both annual milestones as well as phase-transition milestones that govern transition from the ug3 to uh3 phases of the award. milestones toward therapeutic intervention are not a description of specific aims and experiments, but rather are discrete goals that create go or no-go decision points that include quantitative success criteria. more information about milestones, including examples can be found on the counteract webpage. annual milestones may be modified in negotiation with nih program officials before an initial award is made, and during the review of annual non-competitive applications. unmet annual milestones, unmet transition-phase milestones, or an incomplete data package that prevents an adequate evaluation of milestone progress may result in nih ending project support.the ug3/uh3 funding mechanism has two phases, both of which are required in the application. applications must include a milestone plan that proposes a well-defined set of annual milestones as well as a list of specific milestones for transition from the ug3 phase to the uh3 phase. when applicable, milestone reports should describe how measurable outcomes will be collected using rigorous and transparent experimental approaches. these approaches include, but are not limited to, randomization, blinding, use of statistically adequate sample sizes with biologically relevant effect sizes, minimization of potential bias, independent replication, and adequate reporting of experimental details and results as described at https://grants.nih.gov/policy/reproducibility/index.htm.the total project period for the ug3/uh3 cooperative agreement mechanism cannot exceed 5 years and neither phase can exceed 3 years.the ug3 phase:the ug3 phase should include hit to lead activities that enable down-selection from candidate therapeutics to a single lead compound. examples of activities for the ug3 phase include, but are not limited to:transition to the uh3 phase:an administrative review of the extent to which peer-reviewed milestones are satisfactorily met in the ug3 phase will determine whether the uh3 phase award will be issued. applicants and recipients of ug3 funding should note that the ug3 award does not guarantee subsequent uh3 funding. the justifiable go/no go criteria to determine whether a ug3 phase will transition into the uh3 phase will be negotiated between nih staff and the applicants prior to funding.the uh3 phase:the uh3 phase should include optimization activities that enable characterization of the lead candidate for further development. examples of activities for the uh3 phase include, but are not limited to:chemical safety certificationmany of the chemical threat agents of interest are extremely hazardous to humans. allapplications must include a letter from appropriate institutional biosafety committee or institutional review entity indicating that studies are deemed safe for research personnel and the environment (see letters of support in section iv). special safety certifications may be required to conduct research with some chemical threat agents (e.g., chemical warfare agents). therefore, applicants are encouraged to collaborate with laboratories and contract research facilities that are already certified to work with restricted chemical agents, when applicable. see section 4.1.24.3 of the nih grants policy statement for agents regulated under the chemical weapons convention. applicants are strongly encouraged to contact the relevant scientific/research contacts listed in this foa for further information on working with restricted chemical agents.annual countermeasures against chemical threats (counteract) network research symposiumawardees funded under this foa must participate in the annual network research symposium of ccrp-funded projects. participation includes presentation of research progress achieved under the ccrp award. some awardees may be asked by the nih to host the annual meeting for the purpose of information exchange, sharing scientific progress, and formation of potential research collaborations. if requested to host the meeting, grantees may request funding support for this activity via an administrative supplement request to the nih.applications not responsive to this foanon-responsive applications will not be reviewed.see section viii. other information for award authorities and regulations.cooperative agreement: a support mechanism used when there will be substantial federal scientific or programmatic involvement. substantial involvement means that, after award, nih scientific or program staff will assist, guide, coordinate, or participate in project activities. see section vi.2 for additional information about the substantial involvement for this foa.the oer glossary and the sf424 (r&r) application guide provide details on these application types. only those application types listed here are allowed for this foa.not allowed: only accepting applications that do not propose clinical trials.need help determining whether you are doing a clinical trial?the number of awards is contingent upon nih appropriations and the submission of a sufficient number of meritorious applications.applicants may request up to $350,000 direct costs annually for the ug3 phase and up to $450,000 direct costs for the uh3 phase per year.it is expected that many applications will not need to request the maximum budget and the requested budget will need to reflect the actual needs of the proposed project.the proposed project period for the ug3 phase may not exceed 3 years (but may be shorter).the proposed project period for the uh3 phase may not exceed 3 years (but may be shorter).the maximum combined project period for both phases of an application submitted in response to this funding opportunity is five years.nih grants policies as

packages. for due dates on or before january 24, 2023, the data sharing plan and genomic data sharing plan gds) will continue to be attached in the resource sharing plan attachment in forms-g application forms packages.all applicants planning research (funded or conducted in whole or in part by nih) that results in the generation of scientific data are required to comply with the instructions for the data management and sharing plan. all applications, regardless of the amount of direct costs requested for any one year, must address a data management and sharing plan.all instructions in the sf424 (r&r) application guide must be followed, with the following additional instructions:introduction: resubmission applications must include an “introduction to application” section that addresses the comments from the previous review (1 page).research strategysignificance: all proposed projects should have a strong biological rationale for the choice of the proposed injury mechanism and/or therapeutic(s) for the indication, supported by rigorous preliminary data. a well-structured application should, therefore, include clear rational experimental approaches that can yield significant data in support of the proposed indication. this section should describe how the research will lead to development of a characterized therapeutic candidate that can be used to reduce mortality and morbidity in a mass casualty event and is also an improvement over the current standard of care, if applicable.the application should include a detailed description of the proposed characterized therapeutic candidate (to include detailed chemical structure information where applicable). the lack of structural information may adversely affect the assessment of the development potential. nih has multiple safeguards to protect the integrity of and to maintain confidentiality in peer review.investigator: applicants should describe the expertise within the team in preclinical and therapeutic discovery and development and expertise with chemical threat agents.innovation: due to the nature of translational research supported by this foa, some studies and methodologies may not be considered innovative even though they are essential components of the overall project. examples of this type of research include routine preclinical safety/toxicity evaluations and the use of previously established models of chemical-induced injuries to identify potential differences between specific subpopulations (e.g. adults versus pediatrics). this foa also supports and encourages repurposing products approved for other indications, as long as the therapeutic approach using that product is for a new indication.approach: the concept of use of the proposed therapeutic must be explained in the application as it is applicable in a mass casualty/emergency setting. therefore, applicants should consider the rationale for the chosen model(s) and endpoints, adequacy of controls, including timing of therapeutic dosing and route of administration. applicants should address effects of sex and age alone or in combination as biological variables in the proposed preclinical studies (see not-od-15-102). critical elements of a well-designed study include adequate scientific rigor, control of bias, reproducibility, dose-response, confirmation of mechanism, and transparency of reporting. as such, the nih urges applicants to consider and directly address these elements in their application(s). please see not-od-15-103 for more information on enhancing reproducibility through rigor and transparency. investigators should follow the nih guidance for rigor and transparency in grant applications (see guidelines). this will ensure that robust experiments are designed, potential experimenter biases are minimized, results and analyses are transparently reported, and results are interpreted carefully.the ug3 phase should include hit to lead activities that enable down-selection from candidate therapeutics to a single lead compound. applicants are encouraged to also have a back-up candidate. at the end of the ug3 phase, the applicant should have completed sar activities to optimize compound structure and have demonstrated preliminary proof-of-concept efficacy, safety, and pk/pd properties.the uh3 phase should include optimization activities that enable characterization of the lead candidate for further development. applicants are expected to develop a preliminary target product profile during the uh3 phase that is consistent with the intended end use of the candidate therapeutic. at the conclusion of the uh3 phase, the project should deliver a single, well-characterized candidate therapeutic that is an improvement over the standard of care, if applicable. a well-characterized therapeutic will have demonstrated affinity, potency, target selectivity and engagement, in vivo efficacy, adme/tox in an animal model that is predictive of the human condition during or shortly after a mass casualty event, including timing and route of administration.specific aims: provide the overall goals for the entire application and indicate separately specific aims to be accomplished in the ug3 phase and in the uh3 phase.milestones: the application must include well-defined annual milestones and timelines (e.g., a gannt chart) for assessing progress in both the ug3 and uh3 phases, including specific milestones for transitioning from the ug3 phase to the uh3 phase. the proposed series of translational research milestones should demonstrate a clear path towards the selection and characterization of a lead therapeutic by the end of the proposed project period. milestones and timelines for each ug3 and uh3 stage must be provided in a separate heading at the end of the approach section.milestones are a quantitative description of what constitutes successful research progress and development and not just a restatement of the specific aims or list of experiments to be conducted. these should be measures that would be recognizable as appropriate go or no-go decision points in the specific scientific area, such as a required limit of detection and coefficient of variation, or sensitivity and specificity (examples of acceptable milestones are available on the counteract website). applicants are expected to refer to these milestones in annual progress reports.proposed milestones will be periodically revisited and may be revised when necessary as challenges are encountered or new information becomes available based on the trajectory of the research and the field at large. given the high-risk and progressive nature of mcm discovery and development, results at any stage of a project might indicate a dead end, for example a toxicology study may reveal that a molecule is unsuitable for human use. unmet milestones and an incomplete data package that prevents an adequate interpretation of the results will have a negative impact on the approval of these annual non-competing applications. partial budget reductions/restrictions and/or project termination may occur if aspects of the research are deemed futile.environment: the application must include a description of adequate protection and safeguards when working with highly toxic chemicals.letters of support:resource sharing plan: individuals are required to comply with the instructions for the resource sharing plans as provided in the sf424 (r&r) application guide.the following modifications also apply:when involving human subjects research, clinical research, and/or nih-defined clinical trials (and when applicable, clinical trials research experience) follow all instructions for the phs human subjects and clinical trials information form in the sf424 (r&r) application guide, with the following additional instructions:if you answered “yes” to the question “are human subjects involved?” on the r&r other project information form, you must include at least one human subjects study record using the study record: phs human subjects and clinical trials information form or delayed onset study record.study record: phs human subjects and clinical trials informationall instructions in the sf424 (r&r) application guide must be followed.delayed onset studynote: delayed onset does not apply to a study that can be described but will not start immediately (i.e., delayed start).all instructions in the sf424 (r&r) application guide must be followed.all instructions in the sf424 (r&r) application guide must be followed.3. unique entity

and timelines:are milestones robust and associated with clear, quantitative criteria for success that allow go/no-go decisions annually and at the ug3/uh3 transition point?does the set of milestones allow the evaluation of progress in the ug3 phase and will successful completion of these milestones provide confidence that the research team will be able to successfully execute the uh3 phase?are the timelines proposed for achieving the milestones realistic and inclusive of necessary steps, but also efficient without unnecessary steps?are there additional key experiments that need to have milestones designated?are the milestones and approach proposed scientifically justified, rigorous, and appropriate to address the goal of the foa?protections for human subjectsfor research that involves human subjects but does not involve one of the categories of research that are exempt under 45 cfr part 46, the committee will evaluate the justification for involvement of human subjects and the proposed protections from research risk relating to their participation according to the following five review criteria: 1) risk to subjects, 2) adequacy of protection against risks, 3) potential benefits to the subjects and others, 4) importance of the knowledge to be gained, and 5) data and safety monitoring for clinical trials.for research that involves human subjects and meets the criteria for one or more of the categories of research that are exempt under 45 cfr part 46, the committee will evaluate: 1) the justification for the exemption, 2) human subjects involvement and characteristics, and 3) sources of materials. for additional information on review of the human subjects section, please refer to the guidelines for the review of human subjects.inclusion of women, minorities, and individuals across the lifespanwhen the proposed project involves human subjects and/or nih-defined clinical research, the committee will evaluate the proposed plans for the inclusion (or exclusion) of individuals on the basis of sex/gender, race, and ethnicity, as well as the inclusion (or exclusion) of individuals of all ages (including children and older adults) to determine if it is justified in terms of the scientific goals and research strategy proposed. for additional information on review of the inclusion section, please refer to the guidelines for the review of inclusion in clinical research.vertebrate animalsthe committee will evaluate the involvement of live vertebrate animals as part of the scientific assessment according to the following criteria: (1)

effect or implemented during the period of the award, other department regulations and policies in effect at the time of the award, and applicable statutory provisions.should the applicant organization successfully compete for an award, recipients of federal financial assistance (ffa) from hhs must administer their programs in compliance with federal civil rights laws that prohibit discrimination on the basis of race, color, national origin, disability, age and, in some circumstances, religion, conscience, and sex (including gender identity, sexual orientation, and pregnancy). this includes ensuring programs are accessible to persons with limited english proficiency and persons with disabilities. the hhs office for civil rights provides guidance on complying with civil rights laws enforced by hhs. please see https://www.hhs.gov/civil-rights/for-providers/provider-obligations/index.html and https://www.hhs.gov/civil-rights/for-individuals/nondiscrimination/index.htmlhhs recognizes that research projects are often limited in scope for many reasons that are nondiscriminatory, such as the principal investigator’s scientific interest, funding limitations, recruitment requirements, and other considerations. thus, criteria in research protocols that target or exclude certain populations are warranted where nondiscriminatory justifications establish that such criteria are appropriate with respect to the health or safety of the subjects, the scientific study design, or the purpose of the research. for additional guidance regarding how the provisions apply to nih grant programs, please contact the scientific/research contact that is identified in section vii under agency contacts of this foa.please contact the hhs office for civil rights for more information about obligations and prohibitions under federal civil rights laws at

defense authorization act of fiscal year 2009 (public law 110-417), nih awards will be subject to the federal awardee performance and integrity information system (fapiis) requirements. fapiis requires federal award making officials to review and consider information about an applicant in the designated integrity and performance system (currently fapiis) prior to making an award. an applicant, at its option, may review information in the designated integrity and performance systems accessible through fapiis and comment on any information about itself that a federal agency previously entered and is currently in fapiis. the federal awarding agency will consider any comments by the applicant, in addition to other information in fapiis, in making a judgement about the applicant’s integrity, business ethics, and record of performance under federal awards when completing the review of risk posed by applicants as described in 45 cfr part 75.205 and 2 cfr part 200.206 “federal awarding agency review of risk posed by applicants.” this provision will apply to all nih grants and cooperative agreements except fellowships.the following special terms of award are in addition to, and not in lieu of, otherwise applicable u.s. office of management and budget (omb) administrative guidelines, u.s. department of health and human services (dhhs) grant administration regulations at 2 cfr 200, 45 cfr part 75 and other hhs, phs, and nih grant administration policies.the administrative and funding instrument used for this program will be the cooperative agreement, an "assistance" mechanism (rather than an "acquisition" mechanism), in which substantial nih programmatic involvement with the recipients is anticipated during the performance of the activities. under the cooperative agreement, the nih purpose is to support and stimulate the recipients' activities by involvement in and otherwise working jointly with the award recipients in a partnership role; it is not to assume direction, prime responsibility, or a dominant role in the activities. consistent with this concept, the dominant role and prime responsibility resides with the recipients for the project as a whole, although specific tasks and activities may be shared among the recipients and the nih as defined below.the pd(s)/pi(s) will have the primary responsibility for:recipients(s) will retain custody of and have primary rights to the data and software developed under these awards, subject to government policies regarding rights of access consistent with current dhhs, phs, and nih policies.nih staff have substantial programmatic involvement that is above and beyond the normal stewardship role in awards, as described below:the nih program official will be responsible for all scientific and programmatic stewardship and final approvals of the award and will be named in the award notice.nih program staff member(s) acting as a project scientist(s) will have substantial programmatic involvement that is above and beyond the normal stewardship role in awards as described below.nih reserves the right to terminate or curtail any individual award, including the uh3 phase if there is insufficient progress towards meeting milestones.areas of joint responsibility include:none; all responsibilities are divided between recipients and nih staff as described above.any disagreements that may arise in scientific or programmatic matters (within the scope of the award) between award recipients and nih may be brought to dispute resolution. a dispute resolution panel composed of three members will be convened. it will have three members: a designee of the steering committee chosen without nih staff voting, one nih designee, and a third designee with expertise in the relevant area who is chosen by the other two; in the case of individual disagreement, the first member may be chosen by the individual recipient. this special dispute resolution procedure does not alter the recipient's right to appeal an adverse action that is otherwise appealable in accordance with phs regulation 42 cfr part 50, subpart d and dhhs regulation 45 cfr part 16.data management and sharingnote: the nih policy for data management and sharing is effective for due dates on or after january 25, 2023.consistent with the nih policy for data management and sharing, when data management and sharing is applicable to the award, recipients will be required to adhere to the data management and sharing requirements as outlined in the nih grants policy statement. upon the approval of a data management and sharing plan, it is required for recipients to implement the plan as described.3. reportingwhen multiple years are involved, recipients will be required to submit the research performance progress report (rppr) annually and financial statements as required in the nih grants policy statement.a final rppr, invention statement, and the expenditure data portion of the federal financial report are required for closeout of an award, as described in the nih grants policy statement. nih foas outline intended research goals and objectives. post award, nih will review and measure performance based on the details and outcomes that are shared within the rppr, as described at 45 cfr part 75.301 and 2 cfr part 200.301.the federal funding accountability and transparency act of 2006 (transparency act), includes a requirement for recipients of federal grants to report information about first-tier subawards and executive compensation under federal assistance awards issued in fy2011 or later. all recipients of applicable nih grants and cooperative agreements are required to report to the federal subaward reporting system (fsrs) available at www.fsrs.gov on all subawards over $25,000. see the nih grants policy statement for additional information on this reporting requirement.in accordance with the regulatory requirements provided at 45 cfr 75.113 and appendix xii to 45 cfr part 75, recipients that have currently active federal grants, cooperative agreements, and procurement contracts from all federal awarding agencies with a cumulative total value greater than $10,000,000 for any period of time during the period of performance of a federal award, must report and maintain the currency of information reported in the system for award management (sam) about civil, criminal, and administrative proceedings in connection with the award or performance of a federal award that reached final disposition within the most recent five-year period. the recipient must also make semiannual disclosures regarding such proceedings. proceedings information will be made publicly available in the designated integrity and performance system (currently fapiis). this is a statutory requirement under section 872 of public law 110-417, as amended (41 u.s.c. 2313). as required by section 3010 of public law 111-212, all information posted in the designated integrity and performance system on or after april 15, 2011, except past performance reviews required for federal procurement contracts, will be publicly available. full reporting requirements and procedures are
