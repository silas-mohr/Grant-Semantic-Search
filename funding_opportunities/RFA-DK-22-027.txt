(forward) urology centers program is to foster and expand the urology (excluding cancer) research community. the objective of each forward urology center will be to support a research project designed and conducted by a collaborative, multidisciplinary team comprising primarily of junior investigators with at least one early stage investigator (esi) and/or researcher new to urology. research project data are expected to support one or more follow-on independent grant applications (e.g., r01s) submitted by research project team investigators. the center pd(s)/pi(s) will lead an administrative (project support) core to provide guidance to the research project team to help ensure the research aims are met and to aid them in their successful integration into the broader urologic research field. the center will leverage intra- and extra-institutional resources, collaborations and facilities and engage as a member of niddk’s cairibu (collaborating for the advancement of interdisciplinary research in benign urology) program.february 8, 2023all applications are due by 5:00 pm local time of applicant organization.applicants are encouraged to apply early to allow

enormous. patients suffer considerable morbidity throughout their lives, leading to a decreased quality of life and overall health. millions of americans suffer from these conditions, their symptoms are not adequately alleviated through current clinical approaches, and the economic burden to the united states is immense. urologic diseases and conditions of significant impact include recurrent urinary tract infections, urinary stone disease, lower urinary tract symptoms associated with benign prostatic hyperplasia, urinary incontinence, under- and overactive bladder syndrome, urologic chronic pelvic pain syndrome, and male sexual dysfunction.despite years of research progress and advances in surgical and medical interventions, identification of prevention strategies and new treatments remain as key areas in need of further progress. identification of appropriate tools, objective diagnostic criteria and tests, more complete descriptions of underlying pathophysiology, development of innovative strategies to target effective treatments to the appropriate patient would further these efforts. contributing to our inability to leverage these approaches and ultimately treat urologic disorders is the limited cohort of talented and innovative investigators with diverse expertise to address gaps, including the elucidation of fundamental aspects of the biology underlying these conditions. enhanced in-depth characterization (phenotyping) of diverse patient groups, development of animal models that more closely reflect human disease, and identification of risk factors for development and progression of symptoms are needed to inform better approaches to clinical care. recruitment of research expertise in areas such as cellular and molecular biology, genomics and proteomics, biochemistry, physiology, developmental biology, tissue engineering, immunology, pathology, neurobiology, microbiology, behavioral and community health, among other areas, is essential for a more comprehensive investigation of urologic diseases and disorders.program description and requirementsoverall planforward urology centers (p20) will utilize a unique multidisciplinary, team science approach to foster and expand the community of urology researchers. forward centers provide support for teams of junior investigators and researchers new to the field to develop a scientific project that will facilitate follow-on independent r01-equivalent grant applications submitted by research project team investigators by the third or final year of the funding period, whichever comes first. while forward centers are expected to leverage existing resources and build collaborative teams, applications should not propose development of standalone educational, administrative or scientific infrastructure. a research project team will propose and conduct a single research project under the supervision of an administrative (project support) core led by the program director(s)/principal investigator(s) (pd(s)/pi(s)).the center pd(s)/pi(s) should have the requisite skills needed to assemble, guide and support the research project team and facilitate access of team investigators to institutional and niddk-funded research and training resources. each center will operate as a component of the niddk cairibu program (https://niddkcairibu.urology.wisc.edu/) which also includes the urology centers program interactions core (u24), george m. o'brien urology cooperative research centers (u54), and the multidisciplinary k12 urologic research (kure and uroepi) career development programs. it is expected that synergies enabled by the forward urology center will allow investigators to generate data for independent grant (e.g., investigator initiated r01) applications by year 3 of the award. research activities should be designed to advance knowledge in the areas of prevention, diagnosis, or treatment of urologic diseases or disorders within the niddk's mission (https://www.niddk.nih.gov/about-niddk/research-areas/urologic-diseases).administrative (project support) corethe forward urology centers have a singular focus on facilitating access of research project team members to the resources and collaborations they need to develop independent research applications. as such, applicants are encouraged to leverage existing institutional and cairibu resources, but they should not propose new infrastructure creation or formal individual career development plans for research project team investigators. the center pd(s)/pi(s), who will lead the administrative (project support) core, must be established investigator(s) with a track record that includes research career advancement of junior investigators and current or prior independent research funding, preferably in the field of urologic research. the role of the center pd(s)/pi(s) is to provide oversight and support for, but not to direct, the activities of the research project team, and to enable access to facilities, resources and collaborators. an example could be a late career stage professor with appropriate experience and expertise who is dedicated to assembling a complementary team of promising investigators and jumpstarting their independent urology research careers.the administrative (project support) core is intended to support the team science goals of the center by ensuring that productive collaboration is sustained among research project team investigators and with the cairibu program. this core is also responsible for timely and accurate reporting of center and research project activities and management of the center's overall budget. while a research project may be proposed that is related to the prior or current research activities of the center pd(s)/pi(s), it must be scientifically distinct and developed primarily by the assembled research project team investigators. to maintain productive communication and collaboration with cairibu and the other urology centers program components, the center pd(s)/pi(s) will:research project teamthe research project team should include up to 3 faculty co-investigators (individuals eligible to submit independent grant applications) with multidisciplinary, complementary expertise relevant to the specific aims of the application. the team must include at least one nih-defined early stage investigator (esi) or an investigator new to urology. inclusion of nih-defined new investigators (nis) and/or clinician scientists is strongly encouraged. please note that to preserve the esi status for future independent grant submissions, named esis cannot be designated as pi(s) on the application. esi/ni researchers who primarily seek or require intensive mentoring, educational and career development training in urology should consider developing an application for support from a relevant kuh k12 scholar program (https://www.niddk.nih.gov/research-funding/training-career-development/institutional-training-program-locations).the purpose of the forward center award is to foster development and multidisciplinary collaboration of junior investigators and researchers new to the field of urology to facilitate their independent funding. to achieve this goal, the overall pi(s)/pd(s) will provide general guidance for the research project only. the pi(s)/pd(s) cannot be listed as member(s) of the research project team and the project itself must address scientific questions distinct from the pi(s)/pd(s) own research.research project team investigators will:as not all relevant expertise may be represented at a single institution, applicants may include investigators outside their own institution. examples of broad expertise for the collaborative research project team may include, but is not limited to, the following team members:research projectthe application should propose a research project that collects preliminary data, such as pilot and feasibility data, to address a research question or hypothesis relevant to urologic diseases or disorders (excluding cancer), or proposes hypothesis-generating studies in the field. the application may incorporate or integrate basic, translational or human subjects approaches. some examples include studies of disease phenotype, normal development, genetics, physiology, and/or pathophysiology of the urinary tract and associated organs and tissues including renal collecting system and ureter but excluding the kidney. while preliminary data are not required, details should accompany the research design methods and/or be included in the overall or administrative core sections of the application which support feasibility of the project. if preliminary data are included, they will be reviewed along with referenced publications for rigor and the degree to which they support the scientific justification for the research project.projects should be proposed that will enhance opportunities for esis, nis and/or established investigators newly entering the field of urology to generate novel data supporting future grant proposal(s); actively engage with other urology investigators, particularly those in cairibu; and that involve new collaborative relationships. the proposed research project may be generally related to the current research of the center pd(s)/pi(s), but it must be scientifically distinct. a plan must be clearly delineated for a path to independent submission of an r01 or equivalent application by research project team investigators by the third or final year of the funding period, whichever comes first.whenever possible, research projects should leverage resources generated through other niddk urology programs and consortia, such as the urology o’brien centers, the multi-disciplinary approach to the study of chronic pelvic pain (mapp) research network (https://www.mappnetwork.org/), the symptoms of lower urinary tract dysfunction research network (lurn; https://nih-lurn.org/), the prevention of lower urinary tract symptoms consortium (plus; https://plusconsortium.umn.edu/), the urinary stone disease research network (usdrn; https://usdrn.org/) or the genitourinary development molecular anatomy project (gudmap; https://www.gudmap.org/).applications not responsive to this

applications will be evaluated for completeness and compliance with application instructions by the center for scientific review and responsiveness by the niddk, nih. applications that are incomplete, non-compliant and/or nonresponsive will not be reviewed.use of common data elements in nih-funded researchmany nih ics encourage the use of common data elements (cdes) in basic, clinical, and applied research, patient registries, and other human subject research to facilitate broader and more effective use of data and advance research across studies. cdes are data elements that have been identified and defined for use in multiple data sets across different studies. use of cdes can facilitate data sharing and standardization to improve data quality and enable data integration from multiple studies and sources, including electronic health records. nih ics have identified cdes for many clinical domains (e.g., neurological disease), types of studies (e.g. genome-wide association studies (gwas)), types of outcomes (e.g., patient-reported outcomes), and patient registries (e.g., the global rare diseases patient registry and data repository). nih has established a “common data element (cde) resource portal" (http://cde.nih.gov/) to assist investigators in identifying nih-supported cdes when developing protocols, case report forms, and other instruments for data collection. the portal provides guidance about and access to nih-supported cde initiatives and other tools and resources for the appropriate use of cdes and data standards in nih-funded research. investigators
