women's health (orwh)the purpose of this nosi is to promote innovative and rigorous research on interoception and its impact on health and disease. this initiative is broadly supported by many participating nih institutes, centers, and offices (icos). for this nosi, interoception includes the processes by which an organism senses, interprets, integrates, and regulates signals originating from within itself and represents its internal states. this nosi encourages basic and clinical research projects that 1) combine diverse expertise; 2) develop and use innovative technologies and approaches to delineate interoceptive mechanisms at the molecular, cellular, circuit, functional, and/or behavioral levels; 3) assess pathophysiological processes of interoception in the context of diseases and disorders; 4) determine the impact of interventions and therapies to manipulate interoceptive processes on health and/or disease; and 5) develop and validate predictive biomarkers, computational models, or artificial intelligence models relevant to interoception and its impact on health and disease.backgroundneuroscience has gained a tremendous understanding of how we sense and interact with our external world through research into the primary exteroceptive sensory systems of vision, audition, olfaction, taste, and somatosensation. we know less about the interoceptive system—the nervous system’s ability to sense and regulate our own internal milieu. from april 16 to 17, 2019, the nih blueprint for neuroscience research convened a workshop on “the science of interoception and its roles in nervous system disorders.” at the workshop, a distinguished group of investigators highlighted recent findings and discussed a wide range of topics critical to the future of interoception research. this workshop addressed some of the key issues in interoception research, including the definition of interoception, the scope of interoception science, interoceptive signaling via specialized “interoceptors,” ascending and descending neuroanatomical pathways that are essential for interoception, normative functions and disease implications, and potential interventions, as well as the integration of internal and external representations of the world from an experimental and computational modeling perspective. workshop videos and program book can be accessed through: day 1 video; day 2 video; workshop program book.the workshop also identified many critical knowledge gaps and challenges not currently tackled by major nih research initiatives such as the brain initiative and the nih common fund stimulating peripheral activity to relieve conditions (sparc) initiative or by individual nih neuroscience institutes and centers via their regular programmatic activities. these critical areas include: 1) characterization of functional circuits and interaction dynamics between central and peripheral nervous systems in physiological conditions; 2) delineation of the interaction between interoceptive networks involved in basic physiological processes (e.g., respiration, thirst, feeding, urination, metabolism) and other sensory, motor, reward, emotional, cognitive/memory, and social circuits to regulate brain diseases and disorders; 3) determination of the impact of central or peripheral disorders on interoceptive networks and the effects of modulating interoceptive processes on associated diseases and disorders; and 4) the need for objective and quantitative assessments of interoception as well as effective technologies and approaches to measure and modulate interoceptive processes.since the workshop, the nih blueprint icos published a funding opportunity rfa-at-21-003 support interoception research focused on functional neural circuit analysis of interoceptive processes in animal models. in addition, the workshop committee members worked together and published a review article on "the emerging science of interoception: sensing, integrating, interpreting, and regulating signals within the self in trends in neuroscience.terminology for interoception researchwe encourage applicants to incorporate and define the following terms in their applications:interoceptive signals are signals that originate within an organism and include at least three major types: 1) biochemical signals ranging from inorganics, such as acidic ions, to organic molecules and small peptides; 2) mechanical forces altering structures, such as cellular shape, through stretch or tissue extension; and 3) thermal and electromagnetic signals, which may be delivered in various forms across the electromagnetic spectrum.interoception includes the processes by which an organism senses, interprets, integrates, and regulates internal signals. here, the action of “sensing” denotes communication from physiological systems outside of the central nervous system (cns) to the cns, through the commonly called ascending or afferent pathways, whereas the action of “regulating” refers to the communication from the brain to other physiological systems via descending or efferent pathways. the cns, especially the brain, is primarily responsible for interpreting and integrating these signals into a representation of the internal world. the systems involved in processing signals about the internal environment include not only the peripheral nervous system and the cns but also components of the vascular, endocrine, and immune systems.interoceptors are molecular sensors or receptors in neurons that directly detect these various internal signals and transduce them into electrical, hormonal, or other non-neural signals to be integrated and interpreted by the brain. interoceptors include chemoreceptors, humoral receptors, specialized mechanoreceptors, and free nerve endings or nociceptors. the location of the interoceptors may determine whether the interoceptive signals are transmitted through the peripheral nervous system or the non-neural humoral pathway.central interpreters and integrators of interoception include neurons in the cns (spinal cord and brain) involved in processing, interpreting, and/or integrating interoceptive signals. they may include substructures throughout the brain, including within the brainstem, hypothalamus, thalamus, insula, and other cortical regions.central regulators of interoception include neurons in the cns (spinal cord and brain) involved in generating signals to regulate interoceptive processes.regulating signals refer to signals generated by the cns to regulate interoceptive processes. the regulating signal can be transmitted via non-neural (e.g. humoral) pathways or descending neural pathways (cranial/vagal or spinal efferents) to effector organs/tissues to modulate their function or their interoceptive signaling. most regulating signals may be biochemical or electrical.peripheral interoceptive neural pathways include both ascending and descending neural connections between the peripheral organs/tissues and the cns. the ascending connections primarily transmit interoceptive signals from the periphery to the brain via two major types of peripheral sensory ganglia. one type resides in the cranial/vagal pathways, such as nodose or jugular ganglia, and often projects to nucleus tractus solitarii of the brainstem. the other type consists of dorsal root ganglia that project into the brain through the spinal cord. the descending connections primarily transmit regulating signals from the brain to the peripheral organs/tissues via cranial/vagal or spinal efferents. in the descending neural pathways, the final effecting neurons or effectors are also commonly called sympathetic or parasympathetic ganglion neurons and directly synapse with the peripheral organ/tissue non-neural cells.research objectives and participating ico intereststhe scope of research to be supported through this nosi is very broad and encourages research that will develop innovative technologies, identify mechanisms underlying interoception, investigate the role of interoception in health and diseases, or develop and validate predictive biomarkers, computational models, and/or artificial intelligence–based models and applications.applicants are strongly encouraged to consult the scientific/research contact listed below to discuss the alignment
