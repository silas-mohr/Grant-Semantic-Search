opportunity announcement (foa), the national cancer institute (nci) encourages grant applications to support research in established cancer epidemiology cohort studies, defined as studies that have achieved their initial planned recruitment goal. applications must include hypothesis-based research using data from an established cohort study and are expected to include support for cohort maintenance, continued follow-up, and sharing of the existing resources in addition to addressing research questions across the cancer control continuum.not applicableall applications are due by 5:00 pm local time of applicant organization.applicants are encouraged to apply early to allow adequate time to make any corrections to errors found in the application during the submission process by the due date.not applicableit is critical that applicants follow the instructions in the research (r) instructions in the sf424 (r&r) application guide, except where instructed to do otherwise (in this foa or in a notice from nih guide for grants and contracts).conformance to all requirements (both in the application guide and the foa) is required and strictly enforced. applicants must read and follow all application instructions in the application guide as well as any program-specific instructions noted in section iv. when the program-specific instructions deviate from those in the application guide, follow the program-specific instructions.applications that do not comply with these instructions may be delayed or not accepted for review.there are several options available to submit your application through grants.gov to nih and department of health and human services partners. you must use one of these submission options to access the application forms for this opportunity.purposethrough this funding opportunity announcement (foa), the national cancer institute (nci) encourages grant applications to support research in established cancer epidemiology cohort studies, defined as studies that have achieved their initial planned recruitment goal. applications must include hypothesis-based research using data from an established cohort study and are expected to include support for cohort maintenance, continued follow-up, and sharing of the existing resources in addition to addressing research questions across the cancer control continuum.key definitions for this foabackgroundlongitudinal prospective cohort studies have made major contributions to knowledge of environmental, behavioral, and genomic factors associated with cancer incidence, morbidity, and mortality and provided clues to intervention strategies to prevent or mitigate the effects of cancer and its treatment. nci has made significant investments into establishing and maintaining large-scale prospective cancer epidemiology cohorts (cecs) with a variety of exposure data, considerable follow-up time, and cancer information. opportunities to leverage existing cohort data are critical to maximizing the investment toward better understanding the determinants of cancer occurrence and outcomes. cec studies have helped advance our understanding of cancer etiology and outcomes, provided crucial insight into key environmental, lifestyle, and genomic factors, and informed intervention strategies to prevent or mitigate the effects of cancer and its treatment.well-designed, population-based cohort studies can provide a foundational framework for cancer prevention and control. nci recognizes that cecs are valuable resources, providing data and biospecimen collections from diverse populations, with great potential for innovative research into cancer risks and outcomes following cancer diagnosis. for example, cohort studies have enabled research linking sleep duration and breast cancer incidence, polygenic risk scores to predict disease, diet quality and blood nutrient values to cancer risk, ambient air pollution and cancer risk, and a host of other relationships across race, ethnicity, and sex. biospecimens collected in cohorts may reveal additional insight into the etiology of disease and provide a useful complement to participant-reported data. because cecs collect a broad array of information across many domains, research can proceed in many directions that leverage existing data. research should be driven by specific research questions that are important, innovative, and enable appropriate use of the existing data with the greatest potential to advance our understanding of cancer etiology and outcomes with the goal to improve cancer control.scope and research objectives of this foathis foa is intended to support research using data from established cancer epidemiology cohort studies, defined as studies that have achieved their initial planned recruitment goal. successful applications will address important hypothesis-based research questions using existing cohort resources, robust data collection as needed, and appropriate analytical plans. support for the cohort study must be related to the scientific research aims and will be evaluated based on the proposed scientific research questions and methods. applications designed solely to support cohort infrastructure are not appropriate for this foa. research questions that include understudied populations (e.g., race, ethnicity, ses, age, geography), less commonly studied cancer sites and exposures, and studies that directly inform interventions and guidelines are encouraged.non-responsive applicationsapplications that propose any of the following will not be reviewed, including:note: applicants to this foa are strongly encouraged to listen to the pre-application webinar sponsored by the nci (date to be published under separate cover) and contact nci staff as soon as possible in the development of the application to discuss the details of their proposed study so that nci staff can help the applicant understand whether the study is within the goals and mission of the institute and is appropriate for this foa. a recording of the pre-application webinar will be available the epidemiology and genomics research program’s website.see section viii. other

the nih mission are evaluated for scientific and technical merit through the nih peer review system.for this particular announcement, note the following:this foa supports cancer research in established cancer epidemiology cohort studies, defined as studies that have achieved their initial planned recruitment goal. .successful applications will address important hypothesis-based research questions with strong scientific approaches that use the existing cohort resources. support for developing and maintaining the cohort study related to the scientific research aims, will be evaluated on the appropriateness of methods proposed and future application of the data collected.overall impactreviewers will provide an overall impact score to reflect their assessment of the likelihood for the project to exert a sustained, powerful influence on the research field(s) involved, in consideration of the following review criteria and additional review criteria (as applicable for the project proposed).scored review criteriareviewers will consider each of the review criteria below in the determination of scientific merit, and give a separate score for each. an application does not need to be strong in all categories to be judged likely to have major scientific impact. for example, a project that by its nature is not innovative may be essential to advance a field.significancedoes the project address an important problem or a critical barrier to progress in the field? is the prior research that serves as the key support for the proposed project rigorous? if the aims of the project are achieved, how will scientific knowledge, technical capability, and/or clinical practice be improved? how will successful completion of the aims change the concepts, methods, technologies, treatments, services, or preventative interventions that drive this field?specific for this foahow likely is it that important scientific questions and/or gaps in knowledge related to cancer etiology and cancer-related outcomes will be addressed by data collected in this cohort?investigator(s)are the pd(s)/pi(s), collaborators, and other researchers well suited to the project? if early stage investigators or those in the early stages of independent careers, do they have appropriate experience and training? if established, have they demonstrated an ongoing record of accomplishments that have advanced their field(s)? if the project is collaborative or multi-pd/pi, do the investigators have complementary and integrated expertise; are their leadership approach, governance and organizational structure appropriate for the project?innovationdoes the application challenge and seek to shift current research or clinical practice paradigms by utilizing novel theoretical concepts, approaches or methodologies, instrumentation, or interventions? are the concepts, approaches or methodologies, instrumentation, or interventions novel to one field of research or novel in a broad sense? is a refinement, improvement, or new application of theoretical concepts, approaches or methodologies, instrumentation, or interventions proposed?specific for this foainnovation could come different forms. for example, does the proposed project provide information about a novel exposure, understudied group of participants, or less common cancer site? does the cohort study use state-of-the-art tools and technologies to maintain and manage the cec? have they developed a process that supports broad sharing of cohort data and biological specimens?approachare the overall strategy, methodology, and analyses well-reasoned and appropriate to accomplish the specific aims of the project? have the investigators included plans to address weaknesses in the rigor of prior research that serves as the key support for the proposed project? have the investigators presented strategies to ensure a robust and unbiased approach, as appropriate for the work proposed? are potential problems, alternative strategies, and benchmarks for success presented? if the project is in the early stages of development, will the strategy establish feasibility and will particularly risky aspects be managed? have the investigators presented adequate plans to address relevant biological variables, such as sex, for studies in vertebrate animals or human subjects?if the project involves human subjects and/or nih-defined clinical research, are the plans to address 1) the protection of human subjects from research risks, and 2) inclusion (or exclusion) of individuals on the basis of sex/gender, race, and ethnicity, as well as the inclusion or exclusion of individuals of all ages (including children and older adults), justified in terms of the scientific goals and research strategy proposed?specific for this foaare there appropriate plans for the rigorous management and quality control of data and biospecimens collected by the cec? how well does the study population approximate the relevant us population?are the cec research objectives described feasible and likely to be completed during the requested period? is there a strong plan for retention? are follow-up rates and/or response rates adequate? are the types and number of outcome variables tracked appropriate for the intended research scope?how appropriate are the existing resources and/or current age distribution and vital status of participants in follow-up to support the proposed scientific aims?environmentwill the scientific environment in which the work will be done contribute to the probability of success? are the institutional support, equipment and other physical resources available to the investigators adequate for the project proposed? will the project benefit from unique features of the scientific environment, subject populations, or collaborative arrangements?additional review criteriaas applicable for the project proposed, reviewers will evaluate the following additional items while determining scientific and technical merit, and in providing an overall impact score, but will not give separate scores for these items.resource/data sharingto what extent does the application describe the facilitation of timely and broad access to cohort-related data and resources to the external scientific community?protections for human subjectsfor research that involves human subjects but does not involve one of the categories of research that are exempt under 45 cfr part 46, the committee will evaluate the justification for involvement of human subjects and the proposed protections from research risk relating to their participation according to the following five review criteria: 1) risk to subjects, 2) adequacy of protection against risks, 3) potential benefits to the subjects and others, 4) importance of the knowledge to be gained, and 5) data and safety monitoring for clinical trials.for research that involves human subjects and meets the criteria for one or more of the categories of research that are exempt under 45 cfr part 46, the committee will evaluate: 1) the justification for the exemption, 2) human subjects involvement and characteristics, and 3) sources of materials. for additional information on review of the human subjects section, please refer to the guidelines for the review of human subjects.inclusion of women, minorities, and individuals across the lifespanwhen the proposed project involves human subjects and/or nih-defined clinical research, the committee will evaluate the proposed plans for the inclusion (or exclusion) of individuals on the basis of sex/gender, race, and ethnicity, as well as the inclusion (or exclusion) of individuals of all ages (including children and older adults) to determine if it is justified in terms of the scientific goals and research strategy proposed. for additional information on review of the inclusion section, please refer to the guidelines for the review of inclusion in clinical research.vertebrate animalsthe committee will evaluate the involvement of live vertebrate animals as part of the scientific assessment according to the following criteria: (1) description of proposed procedures involving animals, including species, strains, ages, sex, and total number to be used; (2) justifications for the use of animals versus alternative models and for the appropriateness of the species proposed; (3) interventions to minimize discomfort, distress, pain and injury; and (4) justification for euthanasia method if not consistent with the avma guidelines for the euthanasia of animals. reviewers will assess the use of chimpanzees as they would any other application proposing the use of vertebrate animals. for additional information on review of the vertebrate animals section, please refer to the worksheet for review of the vertebrate animal section.biohazardsreviewers will assess whether materials or procedures proposed are potentially hazardous to research personnel and/or the environment, and if needed, determine whether adequate protection is proposed.resubmissionsfor resubmissions, the committee will evaluate the application as now presented, taking into consideration the responses to comments from the previous scientific review group and changes made to the project.renewalsnot applicablerevisionsfor revisions, the committee will consider the appropriateness of the proposed expansion of the scope of the project. if the revision application relates to a specific line of investigation presented in the original application that was not recommended for approval by the committee, then the committee will consider whether the responses to comments from the previous scientific review group are adequate and whether substantial changes are clearly evident.note: effective for due dates on or after january 25, 2023, the data sharing plan and genomic data sharing plan (gds) as part of the resource sharing plan will not be evaluated at time of review.as applicable for the project proposed, reviewers will consider each of the following items, but will not give scores for these items, and should not consider them

subject to all provisions currently in effect or implemented during the period of the award, other department regulations and policies in effect at the time of the award, and applicable statutory provisions.should the applicant organization successfully compete for an award, recipients of federal financial assistance (ffa) from hhs must administer their programs in compliance with federal civil rights laws that prohibit discrimination on the basis of race, color, national origin, disability, age and, in some circumstances, religion, conscience, and sex (including gender identify, sexual orientation, and pregnancy). this includes ensuring programs are accessible to persons with limited english proficiency and persons with disabilities. the hhs office for civil rights provides guidance on complying with civil rights laws enforced by hhs. please see https://www.hhs.gov/civil-rights/for-providers/provider-obligations/index.html and https://www.hhs.gov/civil-rights/for-individuals/nondiscrimination/index.htmlhhs recognizes that research projects are often limited in scope for many reasons that are nondiscriminatory, such as the principal investigator’s scientific interest, funding limitations, recruitment requirements, and other considerations. thus, criteria in research protocols that target or exclude certain populations are warranted where nondiscriminatory justifications establish that such criteria are appropriate with respect to the health or safety of the subjects, the scientific study design, or the purpose of the research. for additional guidance regarding how the provisions apply to nih grant programs, please contact the scientific/research contact that is identified in section vii under agency contacts of this foa.please contact the hhs office for civil rights for more information about obligations and prohibitions under federal civil rights laws at

defense authorization act of fiscal year 2009 (public law 110-417), nih awards will be subject to the federal awardee performance and integrity information system (fapiis) requirements. fapiis requires federal award making officials to review and consider information about an applicant in the designated integrity and performance system (currently fapiis) prior to making an award. an applicant, at its option, may review information in the designated integrity and performance systems accessible through fapiis and comment on any information about itself that a federal agency previously entered and is currently in fapiis. the federal awarding agency will consider any comments by the applicant, in addition to other information in fapiis, in making a judgement about the applicant’s integrity, business ethics, and record of performance under federal awards when completing the review of risk posed by applicants as described in 45 cfr part 75.205and 2 cfr part 200.206 “federal awarding agency review of risk posed by applicants.” this provision will apply to all nih grants and cooperative agreements except fellowships.the following special terms of award are in addition to, and not in lieu of, otherwise applicable u.s. office of management and budget (omb) administrative guidelines, u.s. department of health and human services (dhhs) grant administration regulations at 45 cfr part 75, 2 cfr 200 and other hhs, phs, and nih grant administration policies.the administrative and funding instrument used for this program will be the cooperative agreement, an "assistance" mechanism (rather than an "acquisition" mechanism), in which substantial nih programmatic involvement with the recipients is anticipated during the performance of the activities. under
