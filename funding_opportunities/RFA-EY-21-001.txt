application instructions in the application guide as well as any program-specific instructions noted in section iv. when the program-specific instructions deviate from those in the application guide, follow the program-specific instructions.applications that do not comply with these instructions may be delayed or not accepted for review.there are several options available to submit your application through grants.gov to nih and department of health and human services partners. you must use one of these submission options to access the application forms for this opportunity.the brain initiativethe brain research through advancing innovative neurotechnologies (brain) initiative is aimed at revolutionizing our understanding of the human brain. by accelerating the development and application of innovative technologies, researchers will be able to produce a new dynamic picture of the brain that, for the first time, will show how individual cells and complex neural circuits interact in both time and space. it is expected that the application of these new tools and technologies will ultimately lead to new ways to treat and prevent brain disorders.nih is one of several federal agencies involved in the brain initiative. planning for the nih component of the brain initiative is guided by the long-term scientific plan, "brain 2025: a scientific vision," which details seven high-priority research areas and calls for a sustained federal commitment of $4.5 billion over 12 years. this foa and other recently issued foas are based on careful consideration by the nih of the recommendations of the brain 2025 report, and input from the nih brain multi-council working group. videocasts of the nih brain multi-council working group are available athttp://www.braininitiative.nih.gov/about/mcwg.htm.in addition to the national brain initiative, the nih continues to have a substantial annual investment in neuroscience research. the institutes and centers contributing to the nih brain initiative (http://braininitiative.nih.gov/) support those research efforts through investigator-initiated applications as well as through specific foas. potential applicants to this foa are strongly encouraged to contact scientific/program staff if they have any questions about the best foa for their research.to enable rapid progress in development of new technologies as well as in theory and data analysis, the brain initiative encourages collaborations between neurobiologists and scientists from statistics, physics, mathematics, engineering, and computer and information sciences; and nih welcomes applications from investigators in these disciplines.nih encourages brain initiative applications from investigators that are underrepresented in the biomedical, behavioral, or clinical research workforce (see data at http://www.nsf.gov/statistics/showpub.cfm?topid=2&subid=27and the most recent report on women, minorities, and persons with disabilities in science and engineering). such individuals include those from underrepresented racial and ethnic groups, those with disabilities, and those from disadvantaged backgrounds.the brain initiative will require a high level of coordination and sharing between investigators. it is expected that brain initiative awardees will cooperate and coordinate their activities after awards are made by participating in program director/principal investigator (pd/pi) meetings and in other activities.objectivesthis foa is related to the recommendations in sections ii.2, ii.3, and ii.4 from the brain 2025 report. these three recommendations call for accelerated development of new large-scale recording technologies and tools for neural circuit manipulation. these new technologies and approaches will provide unprecedented opportunities for exploring how the nervous system encodes, processes, utilizes, stores, and retrieves vast quantities of information. a better understanding of this dynamic neural activity will enable researchers to seek new ways to diagnose, treat, and prevent brain disorders.achieving these goals requires the ability to record simultaneously from thousands or tens-of- thousands of neurons contributing to the dynamic activity in a neural circuit. the relevant activity may be in clusters of cells packed closely together or may be in widely distributed circuits. current microelectrode and imaging technologies are limited in the number of cells from which activity can be isolated and sampled simultaneously, by the size or location of the area to be sampled, by the depth of penetration, and by the invasiveness of the technique that might prohibit their use in human experimentation. non-invasive technologies suitable for use in humans are currently limited in spatial resolution and temporal dynamics, as well as in their reflection of on-going electrical activity in circuit elements. this foa seeks entirely new ideas, concepts and/or approaches from physics and engineering, and biology, for how these limitations might be overcome to enable increased recording capabilities on the scale of one or more orders of magnitude beyond that of current technology.this foa is also related to the goals of the updated brain 2.0 report, which recommends expanding the functionality and integration of electrophysiological and neurochemical methods. the next generation of recording/modulation technology development should include efforts to improve cell-type and neurochemical specificity. thus, an equally important goal of this foa is to discover novel ideas for technology capable of precisely manipulating activity in circuits. dissecting the function of neural circuits requires the ability to precisely activate or inactivate brain cells (both neuronal and non-neuronal) in order to investigate underlying mechanisms and demonstrate causality. current technologies such as microstimulation and optogenetic approaches are limited in specificity, temporal dynamics, and by the invasiveness of the technique.applications are expected to propose the development of ideas in the earliest stages for entirely new approaches for neural recording and/or precise manipulation of neural activity. such ideas could encompass unique and innovative combinations of existing technology that create a synergistic result. an important goal is to stimulate new thinking and concepts for accelerating development of novel technologies that break current barriers to neural recording and/or manipulation. in addition to experimental approaches, this foa may support early-stage testing using calculations, simulations, computational models, or other mathematical techniques for demonstrating that the signal sources and/or measurement technologies are theoretically capable of meeting future demands. the support might also be used for building and testing phantoms, prototypes, in-vitro or other bench-top models in order to validate underlying theoretical assumptions in preparation for companion foas aimed at proof-of concept testing in animal models.applications are expected to propose research that will explore ideas in their earliest stages of development in order to be responsive to goals and objectives of this foa. the following topics are non-responsive: i) further development of existing technology; ii) neurobiological hypothesis-testing; iii) validation and/or refinement of current technology; or iv) development of analytical methods to be applied to existing technology and/or data.the technologies that would ultimately evolve from these new approaches should be compatible with experiments in humans and/or behaving animals and should dramatically improve capabilities in order to enable experiments that are currently not possible. preliminary data are not required; however, they may be included if available.applications from individuals not usually associated with neuroscience research or teams that cross boundaries forming interdisciplinary collaborations capable of bringing new and untested ideas are particularly encouraged. accordingly, applicants might consider, where appropriate, multi-pd/pi applications that integrate appropriate expertise, including but not limited to biological, chemical and physical sciences, engineering, computational modeling and statistics.see section viii. other

serves as the key support for the proposed project? have the investigators presented strategies to ensure a robust and unbiased approach, as appropriate for the work proposed? are potential problems, alternative strategies, and benchmarks for success presented? if the project is in the early stages of development, will the strategy establish feasibility and will particularly risky aspects be managed? have the investigators presented adequate plans to address relevant biological variables, such as sex, for studies in vertebrate animals or human subjects?if the project involves human subjects and/or nih-defined clinical research, are the plans to address 1) the protection of human subjects from research risks, and 2) inclusion (or exclusion) of individuals on the basis of sex/gender, race, and ethnicity, as well as the inclusion or exclusion of individuals of all ages (including children and older adults), justified in terms of the scientific goals and research strategy proposed?environmentwill the scientific environment in which the work will be done contribute to the probability of success? are the institutional support, equipment and other physical resources available to the investigators adequate for the project proposed? will the project benefit from unique features of the scientific environment, subject populations, or collaborative
