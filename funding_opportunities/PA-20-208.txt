doctoral dissertation research project. dissertation research topics should align with the funding priority areas of nida (http://www.drugabuse.gov/funding/funding-priorities) and the nida strategic plan (https://www.drugabuse.gov/about-nida/2016-2020-nida-strategic-plan), or within the nida hiv/aids research priorities (https://www.drugabuse.gov/offices/office-nida-director-od/aids-research-program-arp/hiv-research-priorities). this program will ultimately facilitate the entry of promising new investigators into the field of substance use/substance use disorder research and promote transdisciplinary collaborations.every facet of the united states scientific research enterprise—from basic laboratory research to clinical and translational research to policy formation–requires superior intellect, creativity and a wide range of skill sets and viewpoints. nih’s ability to help ensure that the nation remains a global leader in scientific discovery and innovation is dependent upon a pool of highly talented scientists from diverse backgrounds who will help to further nih's mission. applications are particularly encouraged from individuals who can contribute to the diversifying the biomedical research workforce as detailed in the notice of nih's interest in diversity (not-od-20-031).research objectivesresearch supported by nida encompasses basic, behavioral, and treatment research related to the underlying mechanisms and health effects of substances of abuse. this foa will provide students with support to perform substance use/substance use disorder (su/d) dissertation research on a topic related to the study of basic, clinical, developmental, epidemiology, prevention, treatment, services, or women and sex/gender differences as they relate to su/d research, and thereby increase the pool of highly talented su/d scientists who conduct research in these areas. nida is especially interested in improving the research career preparedness of individuals from underrepresented groups by providing support to complete the dissertation. this foa seeks to help individuals obtain the necessary qualifications at the doctoral-level with an intent to subsequently establish and lead a research program in nida-relevant fields. the r36 program provides support to complete su/d-related dissertation research and includes funds that may not be readily or sufficiently available in nrsa predoctoral programs that limit support to stipends, tuition and fees, and institutional allowancethe descriptions below are examples of research areas supported by this program and are provided to help potential applicants determine whether a particular scientific topic is appropriate for this initiative. these descriptions are not intended to be comprehensive. in addition, given the complexity of su/d research, it is permitted to conduct the proposed dissertation research in conjunction with an ongoing research study or to use extant data. research studies focused on high-priority nida hiv/aids topics (https://www.drugabuse.gov/offices/office-nida-director-od/aids-research-program-arp/hiv-research-priorities) and health disparities are also encouragedbasic and clinical researchdevelopment and epidemiologypreventiontreatmentservices:women and sex/gender differencesthrough this dissertation award program, nida seeks to foster research on females (both humans and in animal models) and sex/gender differences in all areas of substance use research. from basic cellular and genetics research to epidemiology, prevention, treatment, and services research, investigators are encouraged to explore the possible importance of sex/gender differences in their chosen area of study and to explore substance use issues specific to females.examples of research areas appropriate for this announcement include:special considerationsnational advisory council on drug abuse recommended guidelines for the administration of drugs to human subjects: the national advisory council on drug abuse (nacda) recognizes the importance of research involving the administration of drugs with abuse potential, and dependence or addiction liability, to human subjects. potential applicants are encouraged to obtain and review these recommendations of council before submitting an application that will administer compounds to human subjects. the guidelines are available on nida's web site at http://www.drugabuse.gov/funding/clinical-research/nacda-guidelines-administration-drugs-to-human-subjects.points to consider regarding tobacco industry funding of nida applicants: the national advisory council on drug abuse (nacda) encourages nida and its grantees to consider the points it has set forth with regard to existing or prospective sponsored research agreements with tobacco companies or their related entities and the impact of acceptance of tobacco industry funding on nida's credibility and reputation within the scientific community. please see http://www.drugabuse.gov/about-nida/advisory-boards-groups/national-advisory-council-drug-abuse-nacda/council-statements/points-to-consider-regarding- for details.data harmonization for substance abuse and addiction via the phenx toolkit: nida strongly encourages investigators involved in human-subjects studies to employ a common set of tools and resources that will promote the collection of comparable data across studies and to do so by incorporating the measures from the core and specialty collections, which are available in the substance abuse and addiction collection of the phenx toolkit (www.phenxtoolkit.org). please see not-da-12-008 (https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/not-da-12-008.html) for further details.grant: a support mechanism providing money, property,
