with the international ibd genetics consortium, has identified over 250 susceptibility loci for inflammatory bowel disease (ibd). the ibdgc was renewed recently with a continued mission to characterize the genetic architecture of ibd phenotypes in diverse populations and to elucidate the biological mechanisms by which genetic variants influence ibd pathophysiology and clinical course. however, current resources permit functional investigation of only a limited number of loci, genes and physiological domains, while the biological mechanisms underlying most of the identified ibd risk loci remain unknown. the purpose of this funding opportunity announcement (foa) is to expand the number of ibd susceptibility loci, causal variants and effector genes, and ibd-related phenotypes and physiological domains under investigation via ancillary studies utilizing the extensive resources, including subjects, samples and datasets, established by the ibdgc. proposed ancillary studies should focus on causal variant identification and/or functional characterization of effector genes within ibd risk loci and must not duplicate studies that are either ongoing or already completed by the ibdgc.30 days before application due dateall applications are due by 5:00 pm local time of applicant organization.applicants are encouraged to apply early to allow adequate time to make any corrections to errors found in the application during the submission process by the due date.not applicableit is critical that applicants follow the instructions in the research (r) instructions in the sf424 (r&r) application guide, except where instructed to do otherwise (in this foa or in a notice from nih guide for grants and contracts).conformance to all requirements (both in the application guide and the foa) is required and strictly enforced. applicants must read and follow all application instructions in the application guide as well as any program-specific instructions noted in section iv. when the program-specific instructions deviate from those in the application guide, follow the program-specific instructions.applications that do not comply with these instructions may be delayed or not accepted for review.there are several options available to submit your application through grants.gov to nih and department of health and human services partners. you must use one of these submission options to access the application forms for this opportunity.purpose and research objectivessince its establishment in 2002, the niddk ibdgc, in collaboration with the international ibd genetics consortium, has identified over 250 genetic susceptibility loci for inflammatory bowel disease (ibd). these discoveries have informed classification of ibd clinical subtypes, and improved understanding of the roles of the innate and acquired immune systems, of the autophagy pathway and of the intestinal microbiome in ibd pathophysiology. for the majority of ibd susceptibility loci, however, the causal genetic variants that confer disease risk or protection and the genes, proteins and pathways they modulate remain unidentified. the specific biological mechanisms by which most susceptibility loci affect ibd pathophysiology are thus unknown and have not yet been leveraged for improving disease management and patient outcomes. the niddk ibdgc was recently awarded renewed funding to continue to characterize the genetic architecture of ibd phenotypes, with a particular focus on increasing representation of patients of non-european ancestries, in order to improve biomarker and risk model development, enhance understanding of the underlying biological mechanisms and ultimately improve patient outcomes. the ibdgc's resources are limited in terms of the number of loci, genes, phenotypes and biological domains that can be studied; therefore, additional research is needed to identify the causal variants and effector genes underlying the known ibd susceptibility loci and to characterize their biological functions and mechanistic impact on ibd pathophysiology.this funding opportunity announcement (foa) invites applications for ancillary studies that will collaborate with the ibdgc and utilize the wealth of well-characterized patients, biological samples and datasets amassed by the ibdgc in order to expand the number of ibd loci and effector genes under functional and mechanistic investigation, and increase the breadth of experimental approaches taken to elucidate the biological mechanisms by which genetic variants contribute to ibd pathophysiology.high-throughput functional screening, focused mechanistic studies of candidate genes and variants and biological perturbation studies in a variety of experimental systems may be required to identify causal variants and to elucidate the mechanisms by which they act to influence ibd pathophysiology. functional and mechanistic studies may employ any number of a wide variety of assay platforms and model systems (e.g., cultured cells, organoids, zebrafish, mice) to investigate function in physiological domains relevant to ibd (e.g., gut barrier function, mucosal immunity). investigators may culture cells from patients carrying variants of interest and generate organoids from them; such patient-derived models should be representative of the ancestral diversity of ibd patients. alternatively, investigators may introduce mutations of interest into cell lines or model organisms via genome editing methods. these experimental systems and models may be used to test the effects of potential therapeutics suggested by the functional impacts of the genetic variants characterized. applications to this foa are expected to apply current versions of these approaches and/or propose innovative new methods with the overall goal of mechanistic characterization of a greater number of ibd loci, including loci identified in patient populations of diverse ancestries.investigators from a wide range of disciplines and methodological approaches with possible relevance to ibd (e.g., immunology, cell biology, microbiology, bioinformatics, systems biology) are encouraged to respond to this foa. applications must not duplicate studies already completed or ongoing within the ibdgc. at the time of submission, applications to this foa must include a letter from the chair or vice-chair of the steering committee of the ibdgc indicating that the ibdgc is willing to provide the ancillary study investigators with access to samples and/or data, as needed.specific areas of research interesttypes of projects appropriate for ancillary studies include, but are not limited to:applications not responsive to this foaapplications that will be

compliance with application instructions by the center for scientific review and for responsiveness by niddk, nih. applications that are incomplete, non-compliant and/or nonresponsive will not be reviewed.use of common data elements in nih-funded researchmany nih ics encourage the use of common data elements (cdes) in basic, clinical, and applied research, patient registries, and other human subject research to facilitate broader and more effective use of data and advance research across studies. cdes are data elements that have been identified and defined for use in multiple data sets across different studies. use of cdes can facilitate data sharing and standardization to improve data quality and enable data integration from multiple studies and sources, including electronic health records. nih ics have identified cdes for many clinical domains (e.g., neurological disease), types of studies (e.g., genome-wide association studies (gwas)), types of outcomes (e.g., patient-reported outcomes), and patient registries (e.g., the global rare diseases patient registry and data repository). nih has established a common data element (cde) repository (https://cde.nlm.nih.gov) to assist investigators in identifying nih-supported cdes when developing protocols, case report forms, and other instruments for data collection. the cde repository provides guidance about and access to nih-supported cde initiatives and other tools and resources for the appropriate use of cdes and data standards in nih-funded research. investigators are encouraged to consult the cde repository and describe in their applications any use they will make of nih-supported cdes in their projects.post submission materialsapplicants are required to follow the instructions for post-submission materials, as described in the policy1. criteriaonly the review criteria described below will be considered in the review process. applications submitted to the nih in support of the nih mission are evaluated for scientific and technical merit through the nih peer review system.note: effective for due dates on or after january 25, 2023, the data sharing plan and genomic data sharing plan (gds) will not be evaluated at time of review.reviewers will provide an overall impact score to reflect their assessment of the likelihood for the project to exert a sustained, powerful influence on the research field(s) involved, in consideration of the following review criteria and additional review criteria (as applicable for the project proposed).reviewers will consider each of the review criteria below in the determination of scientific merit and give a separate score for each. an application does not need to be strong in all categories to be judged likely to have major scientific impact. for example, a project that by its nature is not innovative may be essential to advance a field.does the project address an important problem or a critical barrier to progress in the field? is the prior research that serves as the key support for the proposed project rigorous? if the aims of the project are achieved, how will scientific knowledge, technical capability, and/or clinical practice be improved? how will successful completion of the aims change the concepts, methods, technologies, treatments, services, or preventative interventions that drive this field?specific to this foa: how well does the application demonstrate how the proposed experiments will lead to identification and/or functional characterization of causal variants and effector genes in known ibd susceptibility loci?are the pd(s)/pi(s), collaborators, and other researchers well suited to the project? if early stage investigators or those in the early stages of independent careers, do they have appropriate experience and training? if established, have they demonstrated an ongoing record of accomplishments that have advanced their field(s)? if the project is collaborative or multi-pd/pi, do the investigators have complementary and integrated expertise; are their leadership approach, governance, and organizational structure appropriate for the project?does the application challenge and seek to shift current research or clinical practice paradigms by utilizing novel theoretical concepts, approaches or methodologies, instrumentation, or interventions? are the concepts, approaches or methodologies, instrumentation, or interventions novel to one field of research or novel in a broad sense? is a refinement, improvement, or new application of theoretical concepts, approaches or methodologies, instrumentation, or interventions proposed?specific to this foa: how well does the application document that the screening methods, model systems, or other methods of functional and mechanistic investigation proposed have not previously been applied to ibd locus characterization?are the overall strategy, methodology, and analyses well-reasoned and appropriate to accomplish the specific aims of the project? have the investigators included plans to address weaknesses in the rigor of prior research that serves as the key support for the proposed project? have the investigators presented strategies to ensure a robust and unbiased approach, as appropriate for the work proposed? are potential problems, alternative strategies, and benchmarks for success presented? if the project is in the early stages of development, will the strategy establish feasibility and will particularly risky aspects be managed? have the investigators presented adequate plans to address relevant biological variables, such as sex, for studies in vertebrate animals or human subjects?if the project involves human subjects and/or nih-defined clinical research, are the plans to address 1) the protection of human subjects from research risks, and 2) inclusion (or exclusion) of individuals on the basis of sex/gender, race, and ethnicity, as well as the inclusion or exclusion of individuals of all ages (including children and older adults), justified in terms of the scientific goals and research strategy proposed?specific to this foa: how suitable to ibd biology and how well
