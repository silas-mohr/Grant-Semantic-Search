arthritis and musculoskeletal and skin diseases (niams)the purpose of this notice of special interest (nosi) is to inform potential applicants that the national institute of environmental health sciences (niehs), the national heart, lung, and blood institute (nhlbi), and the national institute of arthritis and musculoskeletal and skin diseases (niams) have special interest in applications to investigate the mechanisms controlling the resolution of inflammation in chronic disease states.backgroundinflammation is a critical, acute, and protective biological response to infection, injury, or environmental exposures; however, excessive, uncontrolled, and prolonged inflammatory states can lead to collateral damage to tissues and organs and is being recognized as a major contributor to the morbidity of chronic diseases. over the past decade, research efforts led to the identification of endogenous pathways that facilitate the resolution of inflammation presenting novel opportunities to expand our knowledge on the potential role of perturbations in these endogenous resolution pathways in the development of chronic inflammation. additionally, gaining a comprehensive understanding of the intersections of competing resolution and proinflammatory pathways could lead to new opportunities for therapeutic and intervention strategies to promote the resolution of inflammation and reduce the intensity, duration, and ultimately the development of chronic inflammation.to assess the current state of the science in the field of inflammation resolution biology, a trans-nih workshop was organized at the niehs (https://factor.niehs.nih.gov/2019/5/science-highlights/inflammation/index.htm). the participants of the workshop recognized the need to expand our fundamental understanding of resolution pathways and to assess the applicability in promoting resolution as a therapeutic/ intervention strategy to reduce the morbidity associated with diverse chronic inflammatory diseases. as an initial step, the participating nih institutes and centers are seeking grant applications focused on comprehensive molecular, biochemical, and physiological characterization of diverse players, pathways, and genetic and epigenetic regulation of the molecular pathways promoting the resolution of chronic inflammatory states.research objectivesthis trans-nih partnership seeks to support research to gain comprehensive understanding of the biology of the resolution of inflammation to elucidate the critical distinctions between resolution and anti-inflammatory mechanisms.specific topics of research interest include, but are not limited to the following:within this broad category of topics, each participating institute has a specialized focus of interest as outlined below:niehs:a vast literature knowledge base implicates induction of an acute inflammatory response following exposure to a diverse array of environmental and occupational chemicals. the resolution of this acute inflammatory response may be delayed or perturbed due to factors such as age, gender, and preexisting disease state. we are also beginning to understand that some environmental agents (e.g., air pollutants) induce chronic systemic inflammation. greater understanding of the contribution of compromised resolution of inflammation to chronic exposure-induced systemic inflammation may aid in developing preventive and interventional strategies to address environmental morbidity issues.this nosi encourages, but is not limited to, research applications in the following areas:research on identifying exposure-induced inflammatory mechanisms is considered non-responsive to this initiative.nhlbi:investigations into the factors and molecular mechanisms that are essential to enhance/promote inflammation resolution are considered to be responsive to this notice. research on identifying the role of inhibitors of inflammation or anti-inflammatory agents is not considered to be responsive to this announcement. this nosi encourages, but is not limited to, research applications in the following areas:niams:uncontrolled and dysfunctional resolution of inflammation can lead to chronic inflammation, a common pathogenic element among diseases within the niams core mission. therefore, unraveling basic, translational, and pre-clinical mechanisms of inflammation resolution would contribute significantly to the understanding of pathogenesis and the development of innovative therapies for chronic inflammatory diseases within the niams mission.this nosi encourages, but is not limited to, research applications in the following areas:application and submission informationapplicants must select the ic and associated foa to use for submission of an application in response to this nosi. the selection must align with the ic requirements listed in order to be considered responsive to that foa. non-responsive applications will be withdrawn from consideration for this
