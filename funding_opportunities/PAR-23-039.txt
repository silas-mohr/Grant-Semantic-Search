research infrastructure programs (orip) encourages resource-related research grant applications aimed at developing broadly applicable technologies, tools, and resources for validating animal models and enhancing rigor, reproducibility, and translatability of animal research. proposed studies, models, resources, or technologies submitted under this funding opportunity announcement (foa) must either address research interests of multiple nih institutes and centers (ics), explore multiple organ systems, or be applicable to diseases and processes that impact multiple organ systems in order to align with orip’s nih-wide mission and programs. applications should aim to enhance the rigor, reproducibility, and translatability of animal research through the development of technologies, tools, and resources that have significant impact across a broad range of research areas using animal models. applications must demonstrate how the proposed resources and technologies impact rigor and reproducibility of animal studies. applications for developing a limited quantity of resources are not suitable for this foa.not applicableall applications are due by 5:00 pm local time of applicant organization.applicants are encouraged to apply early to allow adequate time to make any corrections to errors found in the application during the submission process by the due date.not applicableit is critical that applicants follow the instructions in the research (r) instructions in the sf424 (r&r) application guide, except where instructed to do otherwise (in this foa or in a notice from nih guide for grants and contracts).conformance to all requirements (both in the application guide and the foa) is required and strictly enforced. applicants must read and follow all application instructions in the application guide as well as any program-specific instructions noted in section iv. when the program-specific instructions deviate from those in the application guide, follow the program-specific instructions.applications that do not comply with these instructions may be delayed or not accepted for review.there are several options available to submit your application through grants.gov to nih and department of health and human services partners. you must use one of these submission options to access the application forms for this opportunity.backgroundthe success of developing drugs and other therapeutic approaches relies heavily on the use of animal models in preclinical studies. the rigor and reproducibility of animal models are recognized as key factors facilitating the translation of findings in animal studies to successful clinical trials. the office of research infrastructure programs (orip) convened a group of experts from broad areas of animal research for a workshop entitled “validation of animal models and tools for biomedical research” that was held as a series of virtual sessions between november 2020 and january 2021. this workshop was organized by orip in collaboration with the national heart, lung, and blood institute (nhlbi), the national institute on aging (nia), the national institute of diabetes and digestive and kidney diseases (niddk), the national institute of general medical sciences (nigms), and the national institute of neurological disorders and stroke (ninds). the workshop participants identified technology and resource gaps and needs for assessing the value and limitations of animal models and for improving rigor, reproducibility, and translatability of animal research. the workshop participants also stressed the value of, and need for, two-way communication between basic science researchers using animal models and clinical researchers and clinicians.research objectiveswith this funding opportunity announcement (foa), orip intends to support resource-related research projects aimed at developing broadly applicable technologies, tools, and resources for validating animal models and enhancing rigor, reproducibility, and translatability of animal research. this foa seeks resource-related research projects that address key animal resource- and technology-related gaps identified in the “validation of animal models and tools for biomedical research” workshop organized by orip and its institute and center (ic) partners. the identified gaps include the need for systematically phenotyping animal models, improved genetic technologies, high-throughput screening, and integration of multiple research organisms. animal models of interest for this foa include, but are not limited to, invertebrate and vertebrate organisms ranging from c. elegans and drosophila to zebrafish, mice, rats, pigs, and nonhuman primates.orip advances the nih mission by supporting research infrastructure and research-related resource programs, including animal models and facilities for research relevant to human health and diseases (for more details see orip strategic plan for 2021-2025). proposed studies, models, resources, or technologies under this foa must either address research interests of multiple nih ics, explore multiple organ systems, or be applicable to diseases and processes that impact multiple organ systems. applications are not acceptable and will be withdrawn if they only address a specific disease or area of research, are relevant to the mission and programs of a single ic or are related predominantly to the interest of one ic and only peripherally to the interests of other ics.an application under this foa may be predominantly research based if that research potentially leads to the development of tools or resources that will have a broad impact on the nih-wide biomedical research community. an application also may be aimed at final development or enhancement of existing resources.applications responding to this foa should:cost recovery is not required for applications responding to this foa.examples of projects suitable for this foa include, but are not limited to:examples of projects that will not be supported under this foa include those that:applications submitted under this foa should aim to enhance the rigor, reproducibility, and translatability of animal research through the development of resources and technologies that have significant impact across a broad range of research areas using animal models. applications must demonstrate how the proposed resources and technologies impact rigor and reproducibility of animal studies. demonstration of the impact of the proposed project on translatability is not required but is a strength. applications for developing a limited quantity of resources are not suitable for this foa.investigators interested in submitting applications are strongly encouraged to contact orip program staff before submission to discuss whether their research plans are appropriate for and responsive to this foa. applications with projects outside the areas of interest of this foa will be considered nonresponsive and will be administratively withdrawn.see section viii. other information for award authorities and regulations.grant: a support mechanism providing money,
