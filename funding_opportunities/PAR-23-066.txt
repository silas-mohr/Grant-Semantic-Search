nonfatal injuries in the united states and constitutes a major public health crisis, especially among young people, and in particular among racial/ethnic minority, sexual and gender minority (sgm) and disability populations. nih is committed to supporting research that identifies innovative prevention approaches to reduce firearm and related violence, injury and mortality. within the legislative mandates and limitations of nih funding (not-od-21-058, not-od-21-056), this initiative will support a network of research projects to develop and test interventions at the community or community organization level that aim to prevent firearm and related violence, injury and mortality.this foa solicits bi-phasic research projects proposed in ug3/uh3 phased innovation awards cooperative agreement applications. funding for the ug3 phase (phase i) will be used to demonstrate sufficient preparation, feasibility and capacity to meet foundational milestone targets specific to the work proposed. a ug3 project that meets its milestones will be administratively considered by nih and prioritized for transition to the uh3 award (phase ii). applicants responding to this foa must address specific aims and milestones for both the ug3 and uh3 phases30 days before application due dateall applications are due by 5:00 pm local time of applicant organization.applicants are encouraged to apply early to allow adequate time to make any corrections to errors found in the application during the submission process by the due date.not applicableit is critical that applicants follow the instructions in the research (r) instructions in the sf424 (r&r) application guide, except where instructed to do otherwise (in this foa or in a notice from nih guide for grants and contracts ).conformance to all requirements (both in the application guide and the foa) is required and strictly enforced. applicants must read and follow all application instructions in the application guide as well as any program-specific instructions noted in section iv. when the program-specific instructions deviate from those in the application guide, follow the program-specific instructions.applications that do not comply with these instructions may be delayed or not accepted for review.purpose:the purpose of this foa is to fund additional research projects that will develop and test prospective interventions at the community or community organization level with the aim of preventing firearm and related violence, injury and mortality. these research projects will become part of the existing community-level interventions for firearm violence prevention research network (clif-vp), which also includes a coordinating center. funded under a cooperative agreement, members of the clif-vp research network will collaborate to share approaches, data, and methods, working closely with nih institutes, offices and centers. applicants applying to this foa are encouraged to review the coordinating center foa (par-22-120) to fully understand the clif-vp research network structure and activities.background:violence is defined by the world health organization as: “the intentional use of physical force or power, threatened or actual, against oneself, another person, or against a group or community, that either results in or has a high likelihood of resulting in injury, death, psychological harm, maldevelopment, or deprivation.” violence affects people of all ages and its impact is far-reaching. it is a leading cause of death and nonfatal injuries in the united states and constitutes a major public health crisis, especially among young people, and in particular among racial/ethnic minority, sexual and gender minority (sgm) and disability populations. each day more than 1000 youth are treated in emergency departments for physical assault related injuries. both direct and indirect (e.g., witnessing) violent victimization events are associated with not only physical injury or mortality, but also a range of acute and chronic physical, mental and behavioral health conditions, such as obesity, cardiovascular disease, asthma, substance use disorders, and sleep disturbance.cdc identifies a number of priority areas for violence prevention efforts including child maltreatment, elder abuse, intimate partner violence, community violence, firearm violence (including self-directed violence), sexual violence, and youth violence (including bullying). firearm related injuries and death, in particular, constitute an urgent public health crisis with firearms being involved in almost 80% of homicides and overall half of all suicides. the overall homicide rate increased by 35% from 2019 to 2020 to its highest rate in over 25 years, further widening disparities by race ethnicity, and poverty with black men showing the largest increase. in addition, firearm related injuries became the leading cause of death for children and youth ages 1-19 in 2020. homicide is also a significant cause of maternal mortality, as a recent study using national death certificate data found that pregnant women in the united states died by homicide (most often from partners) more often than they died of pregnancy-related causes. in 2020, firearms accounted for the highest proportion of all methods for suicide for males and females. american indian/alaska native individuals experienced the greatest increase in firearm suicide rate between 2019 and 2020 of all racial groups, with the greatest risk concentrated in those aged 10-44 years.despite recognition that violence is a public health condition that is linked to social determinants across the lifespan, most violence prevention and intervention programs remain focused on individual risk factors of violence victimization or perpetration. many current violence prevention strategies tend to be brief, psycho-educational programs that attempt to change individual knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors or are group based, such as bullying or dating violence prevention in schools. there is also a growing body of violence intervention programs aiming to reduce community violence, particularly firearm violence, which often focus on identifying and intervening directly with individuals at high risk of perpetrating violence. while existing violence prevention programs have demonstrated success in changing attitudes and in some cases violence-related behaviors, often such benefits are short-lived. in addition, little is known about the best implementation strategies to optimize the effectiveness, adoption, and scale up of existing evidence-based violence prevention programs, policies, and practices as well as the optimal combination of these individually focused programs with those focused on higher level influences. the limited resources for prevention or early intervention (e.g., funding, staff capacity) make it difficult to reach individuals one by one who might need or benefit from intervention.furthermore, recent events including the covid-19 pandemic and events focused on racial and social justice issues (e.g., police violence, mass shootings) have brought an increased recognition that social determinants of health (sdoh; see https://health.gov/healthypeople/priority-areas/social-determinants-health), namely the often-intersecting burden of poverty and structural racism, are drivers of population-level health disparities. violence prevention efforts must therefore address these sociocultural forces in order to reduce the disproportionate impact of violence and victimization on women, children, racial/ethnic minorities, sexual and gender minorities, and other socially marginalized groups. recent hhs efforts have specifically identified the critical need to focus on these determinants in developing and implementing interventions. for example, cdc’s new strategic vision for violence prevention prioritizes community or societal level preventive efforts along with identifying root causes that cut across these types of violence and address racial/ethnic, gender and economic disparities. similarly, as outlined in a recent nimhd science visioning process, there is a need for more community- and practice- derived, structural, multi-level, and multi-sectoral interventions in order to effectively and sustainably improve minority health and eliminate health disparities.as such, the current situation calls for firearm and related violence prevention and intervention strategies that can be implemented at the community level—which function by modifying characteristics of organizations, environments and settings such as schools, workplaces, and neighborhoods. see nimhd’s research framework (https://www.nimhd.nih.gov/about/overview/research-framework/nimhd-framework.html) for more details. these community-level interventions, in which interventions target determinants of health outcomes that are associated with community physical, built, sociocultural or institutional environments; resources; or functioning, address many of the hhs-identified priorities. by necessity, such interventions require community engaged research strategies, including but not limited to community-based participatory research, in order to develop, evaluate, and implement successfully. in addition, collaboration and coordination across research teams implementing these interventions can maximize impact through data harmonization and sharing that can enhance the generalizability or applicability of findings.key definitions for this foa:community: a specific group of people, often living in a defined geographic area, who share a common culture, values, and norms and who are arranged in a social structure according to relationships the community has developed over a period of time. the term “community” encompasses worksites, schools, and health care sites (see https://www.cdc.gov/healthyplaces/terminology.htm). communities may be self-defined (e.g., the sgm community in a city or county) or defined by the catchment area of local government or service providers (e.g., residents served by a county school district or community clinic). additional examples of communities include but are not limited to neighborhoods, reservations or tribal communities, military bases, or college campuses. virtual or other communities that do not reside in the same geographic location are not a priority for this initiative.community organization: a non-federal, non-academic organization that provides goods, services, support, resources, or advocacy to members of a defined community. examples include community or faith-based organizations, local businesses, neighborhood associations, labor unions, patient or consumer advocacy groups, public health departments, healthcare systems, school systems, law enforcement or criminal justice agencies, social service agencies, or departments of commerce, labor, transportation, housing, recreation. governmental organizations at the local, regional, tribal, or state level fall within this definition.community-level intervention: an intervention that modifies community-level or community organization/institution characteristics. this could include, but is not limited to:the physical/built environment (e.g. restoration of vacant lots or abandoned buildings)the social environment (e.g., community investment in private and public spaces; increasing options and opportunities for access to mental health and/or substance use services);policies or practices of organizations, institutions or governmental agencies that have community-level health impacts (e.g., zoning or permit policies to reduce the density of alcohol outlets; alternatives to incarceration/justice/legal system involvement or linking of services across sectors for individuals with substance use or mental health disorders; policies to increase quality housing or employment opportunities; school discipline policies and practices);norms, attitudes, or collective behaviors of community residents (e.g., community surveillance efforts, bystander de-escalation strategies).interventions that are delivered in community settings and/or use community-based outreach or enrollment but intervene only at the individual level and do not target community-level determinants of health are not considered community level interventions.clif-vp research network structure:the clif-vp research network consists of a coordinating center (cc) and several ug3/uh3 research projects testing a community or community organization level prevention program designed to prevent firearm and related violence, injury, and mortality. the cc and each of the research projects will also work collaboratively with one or more science officers and program officers from nih institutes, centers, and offices (icos). the clif-vp research network will include at least one stakeholder board (sb) to ensure that the network research and priorities align with the current needs in the field and to increase the likelihood that the interventions being tested can be feasibly adopted and sustained if found to be effective.the clif-vp research network priorities and activities will be governed by a steering committee (sc) which at a minimum will include at least two representatives from each of the research projects (e.g., both academic pi and community organization/partner key personnel or mpi), the cc, and at least one nih representative. the clif-vp research network steering committee will meet at least monthly and be chaired by a person (or people) with relevant expertise who will be determined by nih, the cc and all research projects. based on the priorities set by the steering committee, workgroups will be established to carry out cross-project activities. for example, nih anticipates there will be at least three workgroups, one on data harmonization, one on community engagement, and one on network dissemination activities.research objectives:the clif-vp research network will support a network of research projects to develop and test prospective interventions at the community or community organization level that aim to prevent firearm and related violence, injury and mortality.research questions could include but are not limited to:what new and innovative violence intervention practices can be developed from existing theory and/or basic social and behavioral research that would provide additive or complementary effectiveness to existing programs and practices?how can the type and dose of various intervention components be combined and/or sequenced to optimize effectiveness and/or adoption potential in a broad range of communities to reduce violence, especially firearm violence? this could include examination of dosing and timing of intervention components that occur in different sectors such as healthcare, education, and policing.what role do the unique contextual factors of communities and/or community organizations play in enhancing or inhibiting the potential effects of intervention programs? which program components are generalizable across communities/organizations and which may be effective only under certain contextual conditions? this could include examination of whether interventions are effective across different socially marginalized populations (e.g., lgbtq, disability) that are known to be disproportionally impacted by firearm and related violence.how do various sources of adaptation (e.g., intervention content, mode of delivery, population, setting) within a range of community or community organizational contexts impact the effectiveness of the intervention on both (firearm) violence prevention and implementation outcomes? what are the community, organizational and contextual level barriers and facilitators to adoption, scale up, and sustainability of programs and practices and what are the best implementation strategies to address those barriers?in order to foster scientific planning activities, applications are expected to have the following features:led by or conducted in collaboration with appropriate community organizations. a representative from a community organization must serve as the principal investigator (pl), multiple principal investigator (mpi) or other key personnel; the budget allocated to each entity appropriately; and there must be joint development of the research and intervention plan.include multi-sectoral (e.g., education, physical and behavioral health, justice/legal, social services) collaborations involving partnerships with multiple types of stakeholder organizations in the public and private sector are encouraged, when possible, in order to facilitate sustainability once project funding is complete. interventions focused solely on the health care setting are not a priority for this initiative, though interventions that seek to integrate healthcare interventions with those from other sectors are encouraged. for example, multidisciplinary research teams, include researchers from areas outside of the health sciences, such as data science, economics, education, history, criminology, law, and political science.propose interventions that seek to foster change in the environment (physical, built or sociocultural) at the organizational and/or community level. multi-level interventions that also include intervention elements addressing individual- or family-level determinants are encouraged.be guided by a conceptual model identifying hypothesized pathways between the community or organizational level intervention, community- or organizational level determinants, and (firearm) violence related injury or mortality. additionally, projects should propose to use appropriate measures and analytic methods to examine community-and organizational-level mechanisms of action and (firearm) violence related outcomes. research designs that allow for the assessment of mechanisms through which the intervention impacts individual, community or population level violence outcomes are encouraged. mechanisms of interest include changes to behaviors, environments, or policies at the interpersonal, organizational, or neighborhood/community level.research designs (e.g., cluster randomized trials or rigorous quasi-experimental designs) should include the community or organization as the unit of analysis. individual-level randomized designs are not appropriate for this initiative. more information is available here: https://researchmethodsresources.nih.gov/methods/grtcollect or obtain data beyond individual self-report to determine how the intervention is impacting community- or organizational-level determinants of firearm and related violence. violence related outcomes can be assessed at a combination of the individual, interpersonal, organizational, and/or community level.be supported by relevant preliminary data from at least one setting. it is not required for the intervention to have been pilot tested in multiple communities, organizations, or settings.prospectively test the impact of community level interventions on firearm and related violence and victimization outcomes. the intervention(s) may include interventions already planned by community organizations but not yet implemented or new interventions developed as part of this research study. however, regardless of the nature of the intervention, it must be rigorously tested prospectively as outlined above.applicants are strongly encouraged to consider and assess the role of intersecting social determinants of health in developing interventions, including the use of measures available in the social determinants of health collection of the phenx toolkit (www.phenxtoolkit.org), as appropriate.nimh encourages applications consistent with nimh priorities for research on violence and aggression towards others as described innot-mh-22-095. all applications to nimh that involve clinical trials are expected to follow the nimh mechanism-based, experimental therapeutics approachto intervention development and testing (seesupport for clinical trials at nimh and contact nimh program staff for more information about nimh clinical trials practices and research priorities).ug3/uh3 phased innovation awards:this ug3/uh3 phased innovation award supports bi-phasic projects for up to five years. the ug3 (phase 1) will be a one to two-year award for a milestone-driven developmental/exploratory study that can demonstrate sufficient preparation, feasibility, capacity and leveraging of foundational activities needed for the implementation studies planned in phase 2 (uh3). phase 1 includes scientific, operational and collaborative planning activities as well as tangible deliverables/preliminary findings that could be informative to the field as appropriate.scientific planning activities may include: development, adaptation or refinement of interventions or strategies; feasibility, acceptability and pilot testing of a proposed intervention or strategy; and development and testing of engagement and implementation strategies (e.g., fidelity monitoring, training). operational planning activities may include development of: the intervention, strategy or model protocol; the intervention manual or equivalent (as appropriate); data collection and management safety and operational oversight plans; recruitment, engagement and retention strategies, regulatory approvals (e.g., irb, dsmp); and other essential documents and procedures. collaborative planning activities may include: finalizing mous with collaborators, forming additional partnerships as needed with community based organizations or service providers, forming advisory boards, and other related activities.the uh3 phase will provide support for up to four additional years (for three years if the ug3 phase lasts two years) to conduct the implementation phase of research that will advance our knowledge of community or community level interventions to reduce firearm and related violence injury and mortality. the uh3 phase award will support the implementation and evaluation of the interventions or strategies planned or developed in the ug3 phase. ug3 projects that have met the milestones for the first phase (e.g., scientific, operational, collaborative) will be programmatically considered and prioritized for transition to the uh3 phase.funding of the ug3 (phase 1) does not guarantee support of the uh3 (phase 2) award for research implementation, and all funded ug3 projects may not transition to the uh3 phase. transition to the uh3 phase will be determined by the availability of funds and the outcome of a programmatic evaluation at nih that is based on 1) appropriate sustainability plans with successful engagement of local collaborating agencies and partners and 2) go/no-go transition milestone accomplishment specific to the project being proposed [e.g.; establishment of relevant collaborations with community and other sector partners needed to advance achievement of the research objectives as demonstrated by the execution of necessary agreements with these agencies for committed financial and/or human resources, data sharing, etc.; demonstrated ability to recruit appropriate individual and/or organizational population samples, conduct data collection, access to data for appropriate data linkages, etc.]. continued programmatic priorities and availability of funds will impact the decision to transition to the uh3 award. appeals of the transition decision will not be accepted.applications not responsive to the foa:applications that do not include specific aims for both a ug3 and a uh3 phase.applications that do not specify a well-defined set of milestones for the planning phase (ug3), the transition to the uh3 phase, and annual milestones for the implementation phase (uh3).projects that focus exclusively on virtual or other communities that do not reside in the same geographic location.projects that do not prospectively test a community level intervention. retrospective analysis of existing or past community or organizational level interventions or initiatives are not responsive to this initiative.projects that do not include baseline data (i.e., prior to the implementation of the intervention) on the outcomes of interest in the populations receiving the intervention.projects that use only individual-level data, are exclusively qualitative (though mixed-methods are encouraged) or that focus on helping individuals or populations cope with the impacts of (firearm) violence and do not directly address community- or organizational-level root causes of firearm and related violence.projects that do not involve one or more community partners who are responsible for implementing or delivering the community-level intervention as indicated by inclusion of representatives of community organizations as key personnel and/or proposed subcontracts to collaborating institutions.projects that propose data collection or testing of interventions outside of the u.s.projects that include prohibited policy lobbying or advocacy activities

45 cfr part 75.205 and 2 cfr part 200.206 “federal awarding agency review of risk posed by applicants.” this provision will apply to all nih grants and cooperative agreements except fellowships.the following special terms of award are in addition to, and not in lieu of, otherwise applicable u.s. office of management and budget (omb) administrative guidelines, u.s. department of health and human services (dhhs) grant administration regulations at 45 cfr part 75 and 2 cfr part 200, and other hhs, phs, and nih grant administration policies. the administrative and funding instrument used for this program will be the cooperative agreement, an "assistance" mechanism (rather than an "acquisition" mechanism), in which substantial nih programmatic involvement with the recipients is anticipated during the performance of the activities. under the cooperative agreement, the nih purpose is to support and stimulate the recipients' activities by involvement in and otherwise working jointly with the recipients in a partnership role; it is not to assume direction, prime responsibility, or a dominant role in the activities. consistent with this concept, the dominant role and prime responsibility resides with the recipients for the project as a whole, although specific tasks and activities may be shared among the recipients and the nih as defined below.the pd(s)/pi(s) will have the primary responsibility for:prior to the end of the ug3, recipients will submit the transition package, which will include the ug3 progress report delineating progress toward achieving ug3 milestones.all aspects of their study, including any modification of study design, conduct of the study, quality control, data analysis and interpretation, preparation of publications, dissemination of data, tools, and technologies, and collaboration with other investigators.the recipient agrees to accept close coordination, cooperation, and participation of nih staff in those aspects of scientific and technical management of the study including those outlined under "nih staff responsibilities" and to work cooperatively with other recipients and the coordinating center where it is scientifically advantageous to pursue common methods and protocols.recipients will participate in annual meetings of the recipients and will support any committees, task forces, and advisory panels related to the project, as needed and will participate in regularly scheduled conference calls with the awarding agency. project budgets should include travel for participation in these activities.upon implementation of the project, each recipient will follow the procedures required by the protocol regarding study conduct and monitoring and data collection.support or other involvement of industry or any other third party in the study--e.g., participation by the third party; involvement of project resources or citing the name of the project or the nih support; or special access to project results, data, findings, or resources--may be advantageous and appropriate. however, except for licensing of patents or copyrights, support or involvement of any third party will occur with the concurrence by the nih program officer to ensure objectivity of research.obtaining prior written approval of the nih grants management specialist in consultation with the nih program officer for a change in any of the key personnel identified in the notice of award.award recipients should aim to make resulting publications, code, and to the extent possible, the underlying primary data immediately and broadly available to the public. see section 8.2.3.1of the nih gps.award recipients will retain custody of and have primary rights to the data and software developed under these awards, subject to government rights of access consistent with current dhhs, phs, and nih policies.nih staff have substantial programmatic involvement that is above and beyond the normal stewardship role in awards, as described below:the nih project scientists will have access to the data and work with the pd(s)/pi(s) to ensure the objectives of the program are being met. the primary responsibility for the program resides with the recipient, although specific tasks and activities will be shared among the recipient and the nih project scientists.nih staff will act as resources and facilitators for activities of the recipient, and will coordinate activities with federal and non-federal agencies outside of the project recipients.the nih, as primary funder and administrator reserves the right to phase out or curtail the award (or an individual component of the award) in the event of inadequate progress or data reporting. nih support of this study is contingent upon adequate participant recruitment based on the grantee’s milestone accrual plan submitted at the time of funding.nih staff will ensure the recipient demonstrates best effort compliance. failure to achieve minimally acceptable milestone recruitment levels may result in the withholding future support and/or negotiating an orderly close-out of this study.nih staff will serve as resources to provide: scientific/programmatic support in the development and modification of study protocols and the design of project activities; advice in the selection of sources or resources; advice in management and technical performance; and assistance in the preparation of publications, as warranted.nih staff will participate in the monitoring of issues relating to recruitment, retention and follow-up of study participants, and monitoring of data integrity and quality control through consideration of the annual reports, site visits, patient logs, etc. this review may include, but is not limited to, compliance with the study protocol, meeting enrollment targets, adherence to uniform data collection procedures, and the timeliness and quality of data reporting as needed to the coordinating center.nih scientific officers will interact with the pd(s)/pi(s) on a regular basis to monitor progress. monitoring may include: regular communication with the pd(s)/pi(s) and his/her staff, periodic site visits for discussion with the recipients research team, observation of field data collection and management techniques, fiscal reviews, and other relevant stewardship matters.additionally, an agency program official or ic program director will be responsible for the normal scientific and programmatic stewardship of the award and will be named in the award notice.areas of joint responsibility include:the pd(s)/pi(s) provide, in concert with the nih staff, support necessary to ensure that sites and investigators, and nih and other research partners fully comply with federal regulatory requirements, including but not limited to those relating to human subjects protections, informed consent, and reporting of adverse events.'recipients and nih will jointly develop appropriate confidentiality procedures for data collection, processing, storage and analysis to ensure the confidentiality of data.all recipients and nih will cooperate to ensure the timely and broad dissemination of lessons learned, to inform researchers and health care, justice, education, social services and other systems as appropriate.the steering committee (managed by the coordinating center) is the primary governing body of the network. recipients must participate in the steering committee. the steering committee reviews and approves the agenda for collaborative research activities, develops and monitors policies and procedures guiding the research activities, and oversees communications. recipients agree to abide by the procedures and policies established by the steering committee.the steering committee, with the support of the coordinating center, will facilitate these and other joint activities including, but not limited to: coordination of research protocols when appropriate, human subjects and other regulatory protocols when appropriate, data harmonization and archiving, manuscript and other information dissemination planning, and initial clearance of manuscripts or other dissemination products resulting from collaborative projects across the network.dispute resolution:any disagreements that may arise in scientific or programmatic matters (within the scope of the award) between recipients and the nih may be brought to dispute resolution. a dispute resolution panel composed of three members will be convened. it will have three members: a designee of the steering committee chosen without nih staff voting, one nih designee, and a third designee with expertise in the relevant area who is chosen by the other two; in the case of individual disagreement, the first member may be chosen by the individual recipient. this special dispute resolution procedure does not alter the recipient's right to appeal an adverse action that is otherwise appealable in accordance with phs regulation 42 cfr part 50, subpart d and dhhs regulation 45 cfr part 16.3. data management and sharingnote: the nih policy for data management and sharing is effective for due dates on or after january 25, 2023.consistent with the nih policy for data management and sharing, when data management and sharing is applicable to the award, recipients will be
