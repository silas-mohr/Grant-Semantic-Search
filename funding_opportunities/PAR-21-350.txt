funding opportunitysee section iii. 3. additional information on eligibility.this funding opportunity announcement (foa) invites research projects that seek to model the underlying mechanisms, processes, and trajectories of social relationships and how these factors affect outcomes in health, illness, recovery, and overall wellbeing. both animal model and human subjects research projects are welcome; however, clinical trials are not allowed. researchers proposing basic experimental studies with humans (besh) should consider the companion foa, par-21-349, "research on biopsychosocial factors of social connectedness and isolation on health, wellbeing, illness, and recovery (r01 basic experimental studies with humans required)".not applicableall applications are due by 5:00 pm local time of applicant organization. all types of non-aids applications allowed for this funding opportunity announcement are due on the listed date(s).applicants are encouraged to apply early to allow adequate time to make any corrections to errors found in the application during the submission process by the due date.not applicableit is critical that applicants follow the instructions in the research (r) instructions in the sf424 (r&r) application guide,except where instructed to do otherwise (in this foa or in a notice from nih guide for grants and contracts ).conformance to all requirements (both in the application guide and the foa) is required and strictly enforced. applicants must read and follow all application instructions in the application guide as well as any program-specific instructions noted in section iv. when the program-specific instructions deviate from those in the application guide, follow the program-specific instructions.applications that do not comply with these instructions may be delayed or not accepted for review.there are several options available to submit your application through grants.gov to nih and department of health and human services partners. you must use one of these submission options to access the application forms for this opportunity.purposethis funding opportunity announcement (foa) invites research projects that seek to explain the underlying mechanisms, processes, and trajectories of social relationships and how these factors affect outcomes in health, illness, recovery, and overall wellbeing.research areas of interest include understanding differences and similarities between objective social isolation and loneliness, how complex biopsychosocial processes are regulated in the body, what occurs in response to dysregulation, and antecedent processes that influence responses to the trajectories of social relationships. studies that involve neurobiological approaches—for example, how social or isolated settings influence neurobiological systems, brain function, and/or behavior are welcome. projects designed to study how changes in the quantity and/or quality of social connections influence health behaviors and outcomes are encouraged. this foa also encourages projects that incorporate aims to promote methods and measures needed to support a cumulative and integrated approach to the study of social connectedness and isolation.the terms "social connection" and "social connectedness" often are used interchangeably in research. for the purposes of this foa, "social connectedness" encompasses both perceived and actual connections to others, as well as an individual's perception of belongingness to a social environment. researchers with questions regarding these terms should inquire with ic scientific contacts.backgroundit is well-established that social ties can facilitate overall wellbeing, recovery from acute illness, and self-management of chronic conditions. less well understood are the processes by which connection and isolation lead to positive or negative impacts on health, wellbeing, illness, or recovery. a more comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms, processes, and trajectories involved in social connectedness and isolation may identify novel targets to inform future intervention developments and to strengthen individual and group functions.for example, the prefrontal cortex can handle multiple, yet not infinite, concurrent processes. changes in prefrontal processing may lead individuals to adaptively self-isolate as a way to reduce external social stimulation, to protect or avoid stress, or to focus on specific cognitive tasks. yet extended isolation can lead to negative changes in neuronal size, activity patterns, and intracellular processes that can reduce cognitive and sensory capacities and subsequent behavior.social media usage, such as sharing photos and videos with family members and friends, can facilitate connections and have salutary effects. social media also can be used to publicly bully or shame others, often youth. targets of social media abuse subsequently may engage in maladaptive behaviors including aggression, delinquency, substance use and misuse, self-harm, social withdrawal, or suicidal ideation. we currently lack an understanding of the biopsychosocial processes that facilitate wellbeing among some who use social media but not others.this foa solicits research to better model the basic individual, social, and biobehavioral processes by which social connectedness and isolation have positive or negative impacts across the lifespan. it encourages projects that accelerate our understanding among relationships between several factors, including those that can be measured objectively (e.g., biomeasures, health records data, occurrence, or length of relationship disruption) and those that require self-report and/or can be objectively observed and reported.the arena of social connectedness, connection, and isolation health research is relatively new, and therefore ripe for construct, theory, and measurement mapping and measurement harmonization efforts. therefore, in addition to understanding the mechanistic relationships between aspects of social connection and isolation in health contexts, research projects in the areas such as knowledge representation and behavioral ontology development are welcomed. if appropriate, projects may use nih-supported common data elements (cdes), electronic health record data, and/or propose sophisticated statistical analyses of existing and/or synthesized datasets.also encouraged are projects that strive to determine optimal measurement approaches across species, that validate and utilize measures across the lifespan, and that test measures in a range of clinical contexts.this foa invites r01 applications that may range between 2-5 years. the r01 mechanism, common to all nih icos participating in this foa, was chosen expressly to empower investigators to propose innovative scopes of work with correspondingly appropriate budgets. regardless of the number of project-years proposed, investigators should budget each year for travel to an annual meeting of grantees on or near the nih campus in bethesda, md, to share research methods and findings. awardees will be encouraged to work together on some shared scientific opportunities at the annual meeting and across the award period.three areas of focus especially of interest to oppnet and participating nih ico’s include, but are not limited to, those listed below:1. effects of social connectedness, connection, and isolation across the lifespan2. mechanisms of connectedness, connection, and isolation3. knowledge representation and behavioral ontology developmentabout oppnetoppnet is a trans-nih initiative that funds research activities that build the collective body of knowledge on the nature of behaviors and social systems and deepen our understanding of basic social-behavioral mechanisms and processes. all oppnet initiatives invite investigators to propose research projects that will advance basic social and behavioral sciences and produce knowledge and/or tools of potential relevance to multiple domains of health research. all nih institutes and centers that fund research and program coordination offices within the nih office of the director (icos) collectively manage oppnet's scientific direction yet may not participate in every oppnet foa. consequently, applicants should review the list of icos in this foa's components of participating organizations. for more information about oppnet, visit https://oppnet.nih.gov.oppnet strives to ensure that proposed projects focus primarily on basic socio-behavioral and biopsychosocial sciences. though oppnet defers from imposing a definition on the field, oppnet uses the following statement to guide the concepts it develops toward funding opportunity announcements: basic behavioral and social sciences research (b-bssr) furthers our understanding of fundamental mechanisms and patterns of behavioral and social functioning, relevant to the nation's health and wellbeing, and as they interact with each other, with biology, and with the environment. oppnet acknowledges that disease-, risk-, and wellness-contexts can provide opportunities to study basic behavioral or social processes, basic biobehavioral or biosocial interrelationships, or methodology and measurement relevant to b-bssr.research objectivesoppnet recognizes that basic research in the behavioral and social sciences can be conducted in a broad variety of settings, including general population and clinical samples. it can also be embedded within studies that include disease (or risk-factor) outcomes, so long as the focus of the study is on basic behavioral or social processes, basic biobehavioral or biosocial interrelationships, or methodology and measurement relevant to bssr research. basic experimental studies designed to understand behavioral, biological, and/or sociological processes and/or mechanisms are ineligible for this foa but eligible for submission through the companion foa listed above. investigators who wish to conduct studies with clinical endpoints as the primary outcomes should consider other nih foas. the ics participating in this foa have specific interests and priorities listed below. oppnet strongly encourages researchers to correspond with scientific/research contacts well in advance of submitting applications. oppnet strongly encourages researchers to correspond with scientific/research contacts well in advance of submitting applications.national center for complementary and integrative health (nccih)understanding mechanisms of action through which complementary and integrative health approaches affect social connection or isolation across the lifespan. complementary health approaches include a broad range of practices and interventions that are not typically part of conventional medical care. complementary approaches can be classified by their primary therapeutic input, which may be dietary (e.g., special diets, dietary supplements, herbs, probiotics, and microbial-based therapies), psychological (e.g., meditation, hypnosis, music-based interventions, relaxation therapies), physical (e.g., acupuncture, massage, chiropractic manipulation, devices related to these approaches), or a combination of psychological and physical (e.g., yoga, tai chi, dance therapies, some forms of art therapies).nccih will not accept applications with feasibility, efficacy, or effectiveness studies to analyze the effect size of an intervention(s) on clinical outcomes as the primary outcomes. applicants for such studies should consult with the nccih clinical research branch.national cancer institute (nci)understanding mechanisms through which social connectedness and social isolation influence cancer prevention and control outcomes, including:studies that engage individuals and segments of the u.s. population that have been typically underrepresented, underserved, and excluded from biomedical, clinical, behavioral, and social sciences research are encouraged.national eye institute (nei)social connection and isolation across the lifespan in people with visual impairment (i.e., living with blindness or low vision), including but not limited to:national institute on aging (nia)causal pathways and mechanisms through which social connectedness and social isolation are associated with health and well-being in aging, including but not limited to:national institute on alcohol abuse and alcoholism (niaaa)impact of social connection and/or isolation across the lifespan, e.g.,research shows that diverse teams working together outperform homogenous teams. scientists and trainees from diverse backgrounds and with different life experiences bring different perspectives, creativity, and individual enterprise to address complex scientific problems. diverse teams of scientists will lead the way to develop more innovative inclusive research that will more broadly enhance public health. fostering diversity by addressing underrepresentation in the scientific research workforce is a key component of the nih strategy to identify, develop, support, and maintain the quality of our scientific workforce. it is expected that the alcohol research centers will include a diverse group of scientists, including individuals from underrepresented backgrounds as per not-od-20-031 (notice of nih's interest in diversity). niaaa is especially interested in enhancing representation from racial, ethnic and gender minorities and early-stage investigators.eunice kennedy shriver national institute on child health and human development (nichd)typical and atypical social development in childhood and adolescencenational institute of dental and craniofacial research (nidcr)mechanistic research on the processes underlying social connection or isolation as they relate to dental, oral, or craniofacial health. specific topics may include:national institute on drug abuse (nida)mechanistic research on the impact of social connection or isolation on the substance use trajectory, including but not limited to:national institute on mental health (nimh) mechanistic studies of the biopsychosocial causes and effects of social connection and isolation across the lifespan, including but not limited to:national institute on minority health and health disparities (nimhd)the mission of the nimhd is to lead scientific research to improve minority health and reduce health disparities. nimhd supports the study of many aspects of minority health and health disparities— from biological and population sciences to clinical, behavioral, and translational research, as well as research on health care services, health systems and workforce development. nimhd focuses on the full continuum of causes of health disparities and the interrelation of these causes. projects must include a focus on one or more of the following nih-designated populations that experience health disparities in the united states: african americans, latinos/hispanics, american indians and alaska natives, asian americans, native hawaiians and other pacific islanders, less privileged socioeconomic groups, underserved rural populations, and sexual and gender minorities (sgms). comparison groups/populations may also be included as appropriate for the research questions posed. nimhd encourages projects that use approaches encompassing multiple domains of influence (e.g., biological, behavioral, sociocultural, environmental, physical environment, health system) and multiple levels of influence (e.g., individual, interpersonal, family, peer group, community, societal) to understand and address health disparities (see the nimhd research framework, https://www.nimhd.nih.gov/about/overview/research-framework.html, for more information).nimhd will not support animal studies under this foa.for the purposes of this funding opportunity announcement, we seek to understand the interrelation between social connectedness and social isolation and minority health and health disparities.national institute of neurological disorders and stroke (ninds)ninds supports neurobiological mechanisms underlying the influence of social connection and isolation on the development, progression, and recovery of neurological disorders. some examples include, but are not limited to:national institute of nursing research (ninr)the national institute of nursing research (ninr) supports research that builds the scientific foundation for nursing practice and policy across clinical and community settings, and advances the prevention, detection, and management of disease and disability. drawing on nursing’s holistic perspective, ninr supports observational, intervention, and translational research that integrates factors at multiple levels to identify their role in health, health improvement and health inequities in varied settings including hospitals and clinics, but also people’s homes, schools, workplaces, long-term care facilities, and communities. for this par, ninr is especially interested in in research related to social connectedness/isolation that addresses:• social connectedness barriers and facilitators at multiple levels: interpersonal, institutional, community, and policy• health disparities and health disparity populations• resilience, community support, and other potential factors that may reduce or buffer the impact of social isolation on health outcomes• epigenetic and gene expression correlates of social isolation that may inform interventions• the potential for covid-19 mitigation practices (e.g., social distancing, decreased family and community contact) to further exacerbate the risk for experiencing social isolation and associated poor health outcomessee section viii. other information for award authorities and regulations.grant: a support mechanism providing money, property, or both

to advance a field.does the project address an important problem or a critical barrier to progress in the field? is the prior research that serves as the key support for the proposed project rigorous? if the aims of the project are achieved, how will scientific knowledge, technical capability, and/or clinical practice be improved? how will successful completion of the aims change the concepts, methods, technologies, treatments, services, or preventative interventions that drive this field?are the pd(s)/pi(s), collaborators, and other researchers well suited to the project? if early stage investigators or those in the early stages of independent careers, do they have appropriate experience and training? if established, have they demonstrated an ongoing record of accomplishments that have advanced their field(s)? if the project is collaborative or multi-pd/pi, do the investigators have complementary and integrated expertise; are their leadership approach, governance and organizational structure appropriate for the project?does the application challenge and seek to shift current research or clinical practice paradigms by utilizing novel theoretical concepts, approaches or methodologies, instrumentation, or interventions? are the concepts, approaches or methodologies, instrumentation, or interventions novel to one field of research or novel in a broad sense? is a refinement, improvement, or new application of theoretical concepts, approaches or methodologies, instrumentation, or interventions proposed?are the overall strategy, methodology, and analyses well-reasoned and appropriate to accomplish the specific aims of the project? have the investigators included plans to address weaknesses in the rigor of prior research that serves as the key support for the proposed project? have the investigators presented strategies to ensure a robust and unbiased approach, as appropriate for the work proposed? are potential problems, alternative strategies, and benchmarks for success presented? if the project is in the early stages of development, will the strategy establish feasibility and will particularly risky aspects be managed? have the investigators presented adequate plans to address relevant biological variables, such as sex, for studies in vertebrate animals or human subjects? if the project involves human subjects and/or nih-defined clinical research, are the plans to address 1) the protection of human subjects from research risks, and 2) inclusion (or exclusion) of individuals on the basis of sex/gender, race, and ethnicity, as well as the inclusion or exclusion of individuals of all ages (including children and older adults), justified in terms of the scientific goals and research strategy proposed?will the scientific environment in which the work will be done contribute to the probability of success? are the institutional support, equipment and other physical resources available to the investigators adequate for the project proposed? will the project benefit from unique features of the scientific environment, subject populations, or collaborative arrangements?as applicable for the project proposed, reviewers will evaluate the following additional items while determining scientific and technical merit, and in providing an overall impact score, but will not give separate scores for these items.for research that involves human subjects but does not involve one of the categories of research that are exempt under 45 cfr part 46, the committee will evaluate the justification for involvement of human subjects and the proposed protections from research risk relating to their participation according to the following five review criteria: 1) risk to subjects, 2) adequacy of protection against risks, 3) potential benefits to the subjects and others, 4) importance of the knowledge to be gained, and 5) data and safety monitoring for clinical trials. for research that involves human subjects and meets the criteria for one or more of the categories of research that are exempt under 45 cfr part 46, the committee will evaluate: 1) the justification for the exemption, 2) human subjects involvement and characteristics, and 3) sources of materials. for additional information on review of the human subjects section, please refer to the guidelines for the review of human subjects.when the proposed project involves human subjects and/or nih-defined clinical research, the committee will evaluate the proposed plans for the inclusion (or exclusion) of individuals on the basis of sex/gender, race, and ethnicity, as well as the inclusion (or exclusion) of individuals of all ages (including children and older adults) to determine if it is justified in terms of the scientific goals and research strategy proposed. for additional information on review of the inclusion section, please refer to the guidelines for the review of inclusion in clinical research.the committee will evaluate the involvement of live vertebrate animals as part of the scientific assessment according to the following criteria: (1) description of proposed procedures involving animals, including species, strains, ages, sex, and total number to be used; (2) justifications for the use of animals versus alternative models and for the appropriateness of the species proposed; (3) interventions to minimize discomfort, distress, pain and injury; and (4) justification for euthanasia method if not consistent with the avma guidelines for the euthanasia of animals. reviewers will assess the use of chimpanzees as they would any other application proposing the use of vertebrate animals. for additional information on review of the vertebrate animals section, please refer to the worksheet for review of the vertebrate animal section.reviewers will assess whether materials or procedures proposed are potentially hazardous to research personnel and/or the environment, and if needed, determine whether adequate protection is proposed.for resubmissions, the committee will evaluate the application as now presented, taking into consideration the responses to comments from the previous scientific review group and changes made to the project.not applicablenot applicablenote: effective for due dates on or after january 25, 2023, the data sharing plan and genomic data sharing
