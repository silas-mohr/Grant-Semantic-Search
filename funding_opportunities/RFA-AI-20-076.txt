therapy has exciting potential as a cure for numerous diseases and conditions, including hiv. strategies being explored include genetically engineering immune cells to generate an hiv resistant immune system, to enhance effector cell activity against hiv-infected cells, or a combination approach to produce hiv-resistant anti-hiv immune effector cells. another active area of research is the specific excision of integrated hiv dna from infected cells using novel genome-editing technologies.the protection of hematopoietic stem cells (hscs) or t cells from infection has involved disruption of hiv co-receptor genes, rna-based gene silencing, and expression of diverse inhibitory modalities. gene therapies aimed at enhancing anti-hiv specific immunity include chimeric antigen receptor expression, t cell receptor engineering, and vector-mediated antibody gene delivery. nuclease-based platforms (e.g., zn finger, talens, homing endonucleases, recombinases, crispr/cas) have been used for site-specific editing of host factors necessary for infection and for hiv inactivation through mutation and/or deletion of hiv proviruses.current gene therapy approaches for hiv are primarily focused on ex vivo transduction of hsc or t cells, followed by reinfusion of the modified cells. many of these approaches show potential in vitro, and in some cases, in animal studies and pilot clinical trials. despite recent advances in the therapeutic cell manufacturing process, ongoing efforts to improve engraftment of modified cells, as well as reducing or ameliorating graft-versus host disease (gvhd), the ex vivo genetic modification of cells remains a relatively inefficient and technically complex process. in vivo gene therapy delivery by direct administration would be minimally invasive, potentially more selective, less toxic, and avoid the current poor in vivo survival and engraftment of ex vivo modified cells. in vivo delivery approaches, by simplifying and enhancing effectiveness of hiv gene therapy interventions, would increase the accessibility and application of anti-hiv gene therapeutics.for successful in vivo gene therapy applications, there is a critical need for developing mechanisms for cell-specific targeted delivery. while some other clinical conditions may require only localized in vivo gene therapy delivery, hiv cure approaches, defined as either sustained viral remission or eradication of hiv infection from the body, will require targeting cells distributed throughout the body. identifying gene delivery vectors with high specificity for the hiv reservoir is particularly important to fully realize the potential of genome editing platforms capable of excising or silencing integrated hiv proviruses in latently-infected cells in anatomical sites that are not accessible for ex vivo manipulation.in vivo gene delivery platforms that are targeted to specific cells/organs/sites are critical, not only for efficacy, but also for safety. the selectivity of transgene expression or activity in target cells is another key determinant of the therapeutic outcome. uncontrolled transgene expression in non-target as well as target cells could lead to unintended adverse effects from high biological activities of transgene products and/or off-target effects of genome editing approaches. also, undesirable biodistribution to nontarget tissues and cells following direct in vivo administration as well as immune responses raised against vectors or the transgenes can lead to their loss and increase the potential for unwanted side effects.purpose and objectivesthe purpose of this foa is to support the development and evaluation of novel targeting technologies to deliver anti-hiv gene therapies to specific cells or sites in vivo. there is a significant gap in knowledge of how to deliver therapies efficiently to reservoir sites or specific cell subsets in vivo (for example hiv-infected cells in tissue sanctuaries or rare central memory stem cells) for more effective treatment and/or eradication of hiv. some of the challenges to be overcome with in vivo gene therapeutic strategies are: inefficient delivery to specific target cells and sites, selective regulation of genetic payload expression to maximize on-target efficacy and minimize off-target effects, and the potential immunogenicity of delivery vectors and the transgenes themselves.responsive areas of research interestthis foa will support the design and development of novel approaches, technologies, tools, and methodologies that will result in new anti-hiv gene delivery systems capable of efficient in vivo targeting or engineering of relevant cell types.applicants should have a successful therapeutic approach, with preliminary data, at the time of submission. for this foa, a successful therapeutic approach is defined as a gene therapy strategy that has shown some anti-hiv efficacy, but not necessarily specific cell targeting in an in vitro or ex vivo system. projects should focus on developing and optimizing delivery vehicles or cell-targeting strategies, in combination with an existing therapeutic strategy, for targeted delivery of the therapeutic following direct in vivo administration in an animal model context. expression and activity of the therapeutic moiety will be studied and optimized as part of the iterative early-stage discovery process of improving specific and efficient cell targeting. applicants are also encouraged to leverage the growing knowledge of markers/features specific to viral infected cells or tissue sanctuary sites to target hiv reservoir cells.numerous anti-hiv gene therapeutic approaches would benefit from safe and targeted in vivo delivery. therefore targeted in vivo delivery of a broad range of gene and cell therapies will be supported under this foa and may include, but are not limited to:similarly, a broad range of delivery platforms will be supported under this foa, including, but not limited to: viral vectors, and non-viral methods of gene delivery such as polymer or liposome-based nanoparticles, nucleic acid complexes modified to facilitate uptake and delivery into cells, and exosomes.examples of activities supported by this foa include, but are not limited to:applications not responsive to the foaapplications addressing the following topics will be deemed non-responsive and will not be reviewed:solving the challenges of cell-specific targeted in vivo gene delivery will likely require the expertise from many scientific fields, including hiv virology, immunology, gene therapy, chemical and biomedical engineering, pharmacology, and analytical chemistry, and thus multidisciplinary teams of scientists and bioengineers are especially encouraged to apply.nimh will support research to develop and evaluate novel techniques to deliver anti-hiv gene therapies across the blood-brain barrier and effectively target cns cells that harbor latent virus such as macrophages, microglia, and astrocytes with limited brain toxicity.see section viii. other information for award authorities and regulations.grant: a support mechanism providing money, property, or
