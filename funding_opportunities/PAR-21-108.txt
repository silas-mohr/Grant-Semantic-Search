dentist phd scientists across the transition from predoctoral dual degree student to postdoctoral scholar. this program is intended to stimulate research and retain dentist scientists in the dental, oral and craniofacial research workforce and enhance their progression to independent research careers.backgroundnidcr invests in integrated predoctoral dual degree dds/dmd and phd training to develop a dentist scientist workforce with the unique abilities to incorporate basic and clinical perspectives into dental, oral and craniofacial health research.following completion of predoctoral dual degree training programs, dentist-scientists can find it challenging to transition to postdoctoral research training positions. clinician scientists particularly benefit from mentorship across career stage transitions (permar et. al. 2020). high levels of educational debt from combined degree programs and low postdoctoral salaries can serve as disincentives to research career progression (d’souza et. al. 2017, physician scientist workforce report, 2014). research intensive faculty positions in most dental schools require rigorous postdoctoral research training and/or clinical dental specialty training (physician scientist workforce report, 2014.) dual degree dentist scientists often struggle to identify institutional support and mentorship to enable them to balance research training with subsequent specialty training or continued engagement in clinical dentistry.the nidcr f99/k00 award is intended to provide individualized mentorship over the transition from predoctoral student to postdoctoral researcher through two continuous phases of support. the first phase (f99) will support up to 2 years of predoctoral training at 100% effort for individuals enrolled in integrated dual degree dentist scientist programs in the united states. during this phase, students are expected to complete their dental dds/dmd and phd training, identify postdoctoral research mentor(s) distinct from their primary dissertation advisor(s), and work with these mentors to develop a postdoctoral research project in a field directly related to the nidcr mission and nidcr grant programs. the second phase (k00) will provide up to 3 years of mentored postdoctoral research career development support. during the k00 phase, a minimum of 75% effort must be dedicated to k00 research career development; up to 25% effort is allowed for clinical activities or customized part time dental specialty training. f99/k00 applicants are not required to identify postdoctoral research mentors or postdoctoral institutions at the time of application. prior to the anticipated time of transition, f99 awardees are encouraged to apply for postdoctoral positions at departments and institutions different from where they conducted their graduate research. the k00 award phase can be activated only after the f99 awardee has successfully completed doctoral degree requirements and the f99 research training program, secured a postdoctoral position in dental, oral, and craniofacial research, and, in collaboration with the k00 mentorship team and sponsoring institution, provided nidcr with a k00 research training and career development plan that will facilitate an independent dental, oral, and craniofacial research career.this program is expected to enhance the research career trajectories of dual degree dentist scientists and foster progression to research independence. k00 awardees remain eligible to apply to subsequent mentored career development (k) and pathway to independence (k99/r00) award programs. the f99/k00 program is intended to complement the spectrum of research training and career development opportunities for dentist scientists. for more information on nidcr opportunities for dentists, see: https://www.nidcr.nih.gov/careers-training/interns-fellows/dentists-physicians.note: this funding opportunity announcement (foa) does not allow applicants to propose to lead an

contribute up to $75,000 toward the salary of the career award recipient. the requested salary must be consistent both with the established salary structure at the institution and with salaries actually provided by the institution from its own funds to other staff members with equivalent qualifications, rank, and responsibilities in the department concerned. further guidance on budgeting for career development salaries is provided in the sf424 (r&r) application guide. fringe benefits, based on the sponsoring institution's rate and the percent of effort, are provided in addition to salary.f99 phasenidcr will contribute to the combined cost of tuition and fees at the rate in place at the time of award, at the same levels set for predoctoral dual degree students under ruth l. kirschstein national research service awards (nrsa). see: https://researchtraining.nih.gov/resources/policy-notices.allowable costs: f99 phase the applicant should request an institutional allowance to help defray the cost of fellowship expenses such as health insurance, research supplies, equipment, books, and travel to scientific meetings. the annual institutional allowance level for the f99 phase is the same as that provided for the f30 ruth l. kirschstein national research service award (nrsa) awards. see: https://researchtraining.nih.gov/resources/policy-notices.k00 phase the nidcr will provide up to $10,000 per year towards the research development support for the award recipient, which must be justified and consistent with the stage of development of the candidate and the

national origin, disability, age and, in some circumstances, religion, conscience, and sex. this includes ensuring programs are accessible to persons with limited english proficiency. the hhs office for civil rights provides guidance on complying with civil rights laws enforced by hhs. please see https://www.hhs.gov/civil-rights/for-providers/provider-obligations/index.html and http://www.hhs.gov/ocr/civilrights/understanding/section1557/index.html.hhs recognizes that research projects are often limited in scope for many reasons that are nondiscriminatory, such as the principal investigator’s scientific interest, funding limitations, recruitment requirements, and other considerations. thus, criteria in research protocols that target or exclude certain populations are warranted where nondiscriminatory justifications establish that such criteria are appropriate with respect to the health or safety of the subjects, the scientific study design, or the purpose of the research. for additional guidance regarding how the provisions apply to nih grant programs, please contact the scientific/research contact that is identified in section vii under agency contacts

facilitate the successful transition to the postdoctoral career stage. consequently, a requirement for the k00 phase award is successful completion of the dual degree program and subsequent transition to a mentored postdoctoral research position. applicants are encouraged to apply for postdoctoral positions at departments and institutions different from where they conducted their doctoral research. it is important for all applicants, but especially so for applicants who intend to stay at the predoctoral phase institution for the postdoctoral phase, to provide a plan by which they will separate from their phd sponsor(s) research program and primary mentorship. the phd sponsor is encouraged to continue to serve as a resource for career development during the k00 phase but may not be the primary k00 phase mentor.the postdoctoral research advisor(s) will provide plans to promote the candidate’s research productivity, including publications, along with career development training in areas necessary for an independent research career, such as grant writing and laboratory management. it is strongly encouraged for the mentorship team to include a dentist scientist.the transition from the predoctoral phase to the postdoctoral phase is intended to be continuous in time and, except in unusual circumstances, nidcr will not extend the f99 phase. to begin the k00 award phase of the grant, individuals must have been offered and accepted a postdoctoral appointment to carry out dental, oral, and craniofacial research. upon starting the k00 phase of the award, the f99 phase of the award is terminated. early transitions to the k00 phase of the award may be allowed on a case by case basis.f99 awardees are strongly encouraged to contact the nidcr program official as soon as an offer for a postdoctoral position develops, and not later than 6 months prior to the end of the f99 phase of the award.an eligible k00 institution must have appropriate research facilities and the mentor(s) must have a history of external research awards and sufficient funds to support the proposed postdoctoral research program. foreign institutions are not eligible. applicants may apply for postdoctoral positions within the nih intramural research program (irp). however, should the individual accept such a position in the irp as described under eligibility, the postdoctoral phase will be supported directly by nih intramural funds and the k00 will not be awarded. the individual will be required to submit a final progress report and a final evaluation statement by the primary f99 mentor.the k00 career development phase institution must submit the materials on behalf of the candidate for the k00 award, no later than 8 weeks prior to the proposed start of the k00 award. the institution's authorized organizational representative will email the application in pdf format to the nidcr financial or grants management contact person listed on the notice of award. the k00 application will be evaluated by nidcr staff for completeness and responsiveness to the program.candidates who are not approved to transition will receive written notification from the awarding component communicating the rationale for the disapproval. this notification typically will be sent within 60 days of receipt of the k00 application.although the financial plans of nidcr provide support for this program, awards pursuant to this funding opportunity are contingent upon the availability of funds.instructions for the k00 transition awardf99 awardees wishing to submit a k00 transition application must follow the career development (k) instructions in the sf424 (r&r) application guide, including supplemental grant application instructions except where instructed in this funding opportunity announcement to do otherwise, as described here.the k00 transition application will include the following components:termination of the f99 award phaseif the transition from the f99 phase to the k00 phase at an extramural institution occurs prior to the scheduled end date of the f99 award phase, then a revised notice of award will be issued to terminate the f99 phase award. carry-over of unspent funds from a partially completed f99 phase year into the k00 phase is not permitted.the taxability of stipends is described in the nih grants policy statement.fellowships funded primarily for educational purposes are exempted from the phs invention requirements and thus invention reporting is not required. more details, including exceptions for fellows training at nih are
