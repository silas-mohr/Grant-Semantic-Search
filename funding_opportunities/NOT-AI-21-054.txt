national institute of mental health (nimh)national institute on drug abuse (nida)national institute of mental health (nimh)the purpose of this notice of special interest (nosi) is to promote and support innovative methods in big data science (bds) to identify unappreciated biomedical, behavioral, social patterns and other social determinants that shed light on hiv acquisition, transmission, the development of comorbidities, and long-term viral control as in the hiv treatment continuum. bds approaches can bring together data to evaluate the complex interplay between individual, contextual, and structural factors influencing the epidemiology of risk and care. further, because this field can reveal unexpected associations through analysis of diverse data, bds approaches may reveal events that are unseen or transient in traditional analysis of datasets. discovery of these events will considerably advance research on hiv networks of transmission and the care continuum. this nosi will support the establishment of bds standards, bioinformatics data tools, machine-learning algorithms, mathematical modeling, advanced epidemiology and statistical analytic methods, and consideration and application of privacy and ethical issues in the use of public and personal data in the context of hiv research.backgroundthe nih established the nih strategic plan for data science to promote research and to develop biomedical computing and informatics focused on important biomedical and behavioral problems. bds specifically refers to research that capitalizes on the increased analytical speed, data storage capacity and liquidity of diverse data from health, genomics, community characteristics, environment, social media, and commercial activities. thus, data in bds are characterized by their high volume and variety, and the field is evolving to capture, manage, organize, integrate, harmonize, and analyze data to extract new knowledge.the nih is interested in promoting and applying bds technologies, computing, informatics, and analytics to address gaps in our understanding of hiv transmission risks, social networks, and the hiv treatment continuum, including comorbidities such as mental health and substance use disorders. the nih seeks to expand actionable approaches to improve hiv prevention and treatment. while bds methods can provide insight into health behaviors, there are also ethical considerations. examples include issues of anonymity and the use of data, collected under conditions thought to be private or combined in ways unanticipated by the community. yet, because of the ability to elucidate associations not seen in less diverse data sets and the inherent scalability, these methods may yield transformative approaches in hiv prevention, treatment, and long-term outcomes. bds research may also be able to shed light on behaviors that occur outside of venues surveyed by health professionals, or behaviors that are significantly modified by the presence of others, and thus are difficult to document. research that seeks to identify rare, unseen, and perhaps transient events, networks, risk and health seeking behaviors as they pertain to hiv will fundamentally improve the quality of the inferences but may risk a loss of privacy or confidentiality. accompanying this work, the nih expects the involvement of a bioethicist and development of an ethical framework where appropriate.research objectivesthis nosi seeks to promote multidisciplinary collaborations across epidemiology, bioinformatics, mathematical modeling, statistics, social and behavioral sciences, hiv prevention and care, and bioethics, among others, to address the following:specific areas of research interest include but are not limited to:nida is interested in research proposing novel ways to integrate data of different types and scales to allow new types of analysis through big data science approaches to:it is critical to enhance data-sharing and access to ensure that funded data be findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (fair).all niaid-funded researchers are encouraged to share research data, tools, software, or resources to enhance the rigor and reproducibility of research results and secondary use per the niaid data sharing guidelinesat: https://www.niaid.nih.gov/research/data-sharing-guidelines, as appropriate.the nih recognizes that certain factors (e.g.,legal, ethical, technical) may limit the ability to preserve and share data. any data or resource sharing plans must ensure data security and compliance with privacy protections for human data. plans should include consideration of these factors, when applicable, in describing the approach to data management and data sharing.
