opportunity announcement (foa) invites applications that propose to establish a national coordinating center that will serve as a centralized hub for accessing, harmonizing, linking, and sharing environmental contextual data and individual exposure data with nia/nih-funded projects. the aim of this initiative is to foster collaboration and accelerate life course research on the social, behavioral, psychological, and economic exposures that shape alzheimer’s disease (ad) and ad-related dementias (adrd) outcomes and inequities.applications to establish the ad/adrd exposome coordinating center must identify five to seven social, behavioral, psychological, and economic exposome domains relevant to ad/adrd, and describe activities related to the domains that will achieve the following objectives of this foa:august 27, 2023all applications are due by 5:00 pm local time of applicant organization.applicants are encouraged to apply early to allow adequate time to make any corrections to errors found in the application during the submission process by the due date.no late applications will be accepted for this funding opportunity announcement.not applicableit is critical that applicants follow the instructions in the research (r) instructions in the sf424 (r&r) application guide, except where instructed to do otherwise (in this foa or in a notice from nih guide for grants and contracts ).conformance to all requirements (both in the application guide and the foa) is required and strictly enforced. applicants must read and follow all application instructions in the application guide as well as any program-specific instructions noted in section iv. when the program-specific instructions deviate from those in the application guide, follow the program-specific instructions.applications that do not comply with these instructions may be delayed or not accepted for review.there are several options available to submit your application through grants.gov to nih and department of health and human services partners. you must use one of these submission options to access the application forms for this opportunity.a variety of exposures in the environments where people live, work, pray, and play shape health, including one’s risk profile for alzheimer’s disease (ad) and ad-related dementias (adrd). together, this comprehensive set of exposures across domains (e.g., physical, chemical, social, psychological, economic) constitute the “exposome.” the exposome impacts individuals’ health and development from before they are born and continues throughout their lives. aspects of the exposome salient for ad/adrd range from the microscopic (e.g., microbiome, particulate matter, sars-cov-2) to the individual (e.g., early life adversity, occupational history, lifestyle) to the macro level (e.g., structural racism, climate change). moreover, exposures vary by place and individual life history and change over time. this underscores the need for longitudinal studies to examine the timing, dose, and duration of unique or combined exposures that may account for individual differences and group disparities in dementia-related outcomes and help us identify potential targets for prevention. central to this research agenda is the recognition that exposures are inequitably distributed in our society. social and environmental contexts are key social determinants of health but often tend to cluster. for example, individuals with less education or members of marginalized populations are more likely to live in communities with fewer resources and be exposed to more environmental hazards. behavioral and social research on the exposome seeks to understand how contextual features of social, economic, cultural, and built environments and individual-level behavioral and social factors interact with biological processes to “get under the skin” to affect health. a recent nia workshop, understanding the role of the exposome in brain aging, alzheimer’s disease (ad) and ad-related dementias (adrd), highlighted the need for further investigation into how social environmental and behavioral factors impact disparities in, and the etiology of, ad/adrd.exposome measures include environmental contextual data and individual exposure data. environmental contextual exposure information can be linked to, and data from questions about individual exposures can be incorporated in, longitudinal population-representative surveys or deeply phenotyped studies. in addition to information collected from individual survey items, exposome data can be gathered from personally worn sensors or from administrative data linkages. together, these data can allow us to answer rich questions about the impact of various environmental and personal exposures on the social and behavioral life course processes that influence health outcomes, including cognitive aging and ad/adrd.in response to congressional report language “recogniz[ing] the importance of mechanistic research to address adrd disparities, including the social and contextual factors that contribute to increased risk for disease,” this foa invites applications that propose to establish a national ad/adrd exposome coordinating center, which henceforth will be referred to as "the cc." the cc will serve as a centralized hub for accessing, harmonizing, linking, and sharing environmental contextual data and individual exposure data with nia/nih-funded projects that hold potential for advancing the understanding of links between life course exposures and ad/adrd risk and resilience, as well as disparities in ad/adrd across populations.the objectives of this foa are the following:nia already supports numerous population-based longitudinal studies that capture variation in the social, healthcare, and policy environment and have worked to harmonize data to facilitate cross-national comparative research on aging. for example, nia supports a set of nationally representative international studies harmonized with the health and retirement study (hrs) in the u.s. a number of these studies, including the hrs, incorporates the harmonized cognitive assessment protocol (hcap) to allow for the study of environmental and behavioral factors linked to dementia risk. resources such as gateway to global aging data and national archive of computerized data on aging (nacda) support these efforts by providing researchers with information about variables shared across studies. in addition, the hrs has, and continues to develop, contextual data linkages allowing researchers (via the micda enclave virtual desktop infrastructure) to examine hrs data in combination with geographically-linked data on health care and long-term care access, air quality, land use, crime, food access, covid-19 policies, etc. additional sources of contextual data on topics ranging from community resilience to disasters (such as the census community resilience estimates) to economic vulnerability (e.g., housing eviction) are available from federal and private sources and offer opportunities for expansion of these nia-funded resources.additional nia-funded longitudinal studies of aging and ad/adrd that focus on the role of social, behavioral, psychological, and economic exposures in shaping health outcomes hold potential for advancing this work (see, for example, data resources for behavioral and social research on aging). similarly, other ad/adrd studies/projects may benefit from the addition of resources developed under this initiative as they seek to incorporate a wider array of risk and protective factors into their analyses to better understand ad/adrd etiology and disparities. alongside the population-based longitudinal studies, nia also supports educational cohort studies seeking to elucidate how education and other social and economic factors (e.g., social relationships, occupation) operate as risk and protective factors for ad/adrd risk across the life course, and social inequities therein. a recent funding initiative aims to enhance measures of educational exposures and cognitive assessments in existing studies to support this line of ad/adrd research. nia also has investments in longitudinal deeply-phenotyped biosocial surveys – collectively spanning the full life course – that are rich in psychological, social, behavioral, and biological content. these surveys often bring participants into clinics or neuroscience labs for health, performance, and imaging protocols, allowing the study of integrative pathways linking social environments, psychological processes, behaviors, cognition, and physical health.in addition, a number of nia-supported centers that support centralized infrastructure for aging and ad/adrd science may contribute to, or leverage, resources from this initiative to support the harmonization of exposure measures and enable comparability across studies. finally, nia supports behavioral and social research networks that develop and share resources for contextual and individual exposure assessment in social, behavioral, psychological, and economic domains, including psychosocial stress, early life adversity, education, criminal justice involvement, state and local policy, rurality, and other social determinants of health.alongside these studies, centers, and networks, there exist multiple federal and private sources of administrative and contextual data, a variety of nia-funded efforts to forge links between some of these sources and specific nia studies, and a widely dispersed set of efforts to create tools to address the needs of various groups working in exposome science. common data elements (cdes) and databases of vetted measures may be helpful for investigators and could advance research on the role of the exposome in health. in addition to selecting appropriate measures, a significant hurdle for researchers is combining and harmonizing datasets to create larger data resources, with challenges that may be specific to some forms of social and behavioral data. the federal statistical system, including the census bureau and the national center for health statistics, as well as private sources, have extensive sets of validated measures that investigators may be able to use, which can then facilitate comparisons of non-representative samples to larger populations. however, investigators currently spend considerable time selecting measures specifically tailored to their own protocol. as concerns grow about the role of social and behavioral determinants of health, obtaining and assembling contextual data and individual level exposure data requires common solutions that would benefit multiple investigators and accelerate the study of the role of the exposome in ad/adrd risk.while these valuable and disparate projects are all actively contributing to exposome research on the social and behavioral determinants of aging and ad/adrd, there is value in greater coordination among them to accelerate progress on understanding the role of the exposome in ad/adrd risk. to date, the rich resources and infrastructure described above are not centrally organized, which reduces the potential impact of existing investments. the resources developed through this initiative, if widely shared and disseminated to the broad range of nia-supported programs examining ad/adrd risk and resilience factors, may support efforts to understand whether and how exposures operate differently in different contexts to shape ad/adrd etiology and disparities.the cc will facilitate and advance research on the role of social, behavioral, psychological, and economic exposures in the etiology of, and disparities in, ad/adrd risk and resilience through research development and sharing activities intended to support the field. it will offer researchers across the many disciplines addressing ad/adrd science an authoritative source of guidance and tools for the study and measurement of environmental contextual and individual exposures in their work. applicants are strongly encouraged to consider types of exposures operating at multiple levels of influence across the life course, with attention to timing, dose, and duration. each application must propose five to seven social, behavioral, psychological, and economic exposome domains relevant to ad/adrd, justify that relevance, and articulate strategies to develop or link measures within these domains to nia infrastructure projects and disseminate tools for their wider use by the research community. examples of socially- and behaviorally-driven exposure domains that fall within the scope of this foa include, but are not limited to, the following:examples of types of exposure data that fall within the scope of this foa include, but are not limited to, the following:the cc will facilitate the development and

contained in section 872 of the duncan hunter national defense authorization act of fiscal year 2009 (public law 110-417), nih awards will be subject to the federal awardee performance and integrity information system (fapiis) requirements. fapiis requires federal award making officials to review and consider information about an applicant in the designated integrity and performance system (currently fapiis) prior to making an award. an applicant, at its option, may review information in the designated integrity and performance systems accessible through fapiis and comment on any information about itself that a federal agency previously entered and is currently in fapiis. the federal awarding agency will consider any comments by the applicant, in addition to other information in fapiis, in making a judgement about the applicant’s integrity, business ethics, and record of performance under federal awards when completing the review of risk posed by applicants as described in 45 cfr part 75.205 and 2 cfr part 200.206 “federal awarding agency review of risk posed by applicants.” this provision will apply to all nih grants and cooperative agreements except fellowships.”the following special terms of award are in addition to, and not in lieu of, otherwise applicable u.s. office of management and budget (omb) administrative guidelines, u.s. department of health and human services (dhhs) grant administration regulations at 45 cfr part 75 and 2 cfr part 200, and other hhs, phs, and nih grant administration policies. the administrative and funding instrument used for this program will be the cooperative agreement, an "assistance", rather than an "acquisition" mechanism in which substantial nih programmatic involvement with the recipients is anticipated during the performance of the activities. under the cooperative agreement, the nih purpose is to support and stimulate the recipients' activities by involvement in and otherwise working jointly with the recipients in a partnership role; it is not to assume direction, prime responsibility, or a dominant role in the activities. consistent with this concept, the prime responsibility of conducting study aims resides with the recipients for the project as a whole, although specific tasks and activities may be shared among the recipients and the nih as defined below.the pd(s)/pi(s) will have the primary responsibility for:nih staff have substantial programmatic involvement that is above and beyond the normal stewardship role in awards, as described below:a reas of joint responsibility include:coordinating center advisory committeethe nia program official and the pis may request the ccac’s assistance on specific issues. the nia program official and the investigators will consider the recommendations of the ccac regarding implementation of cc aims, as well as additions or changes to content and methods, during the execution of the cooperative agreement. any new ccac chair and members will be appointed by nia when necessary. nia will provide a charter for the ccac that describes the selection, composition, tenure, and responsibilities of the ccac membership.dispute resolution:any disagreements that may arise in scientific or programmatic matters (within the scope of the award) between recipients and the nih may be brought to dispute resolution. a dispute resolution panel composed of three members will be convened: a designee of the ccac chosen by majority vote of the ccac, one nih designee chosen by the nia program official, and a third designee with expertise in the relevant area who is chosen by the other two members. this special dispute resolution procedure does not alter the recipient's right to appeal an adverse action that is otherwise appealable in accordance with phs regulation 42 cfr part 50, subpart d and dhhs regulation 45 cfr part 16.3. data management and sharingnote: the nih policy for data management and sharing is effective for due dates on or after january 25, 2023.consistent with the nih policy for data management and sharing, when data management and sharing is applicable to the award, recipients will be required to adhere to the data management and sharing requirements as outlined in the nih grants policy statement. upon the approval of a data management and sharing plan, it is required for recipients to implement the plan as described.this program requires sharing of research resources to facilitate collaboration across multiple projects/programs. the goal of this requirement is to facilitate innovative, replicable, and comparable social, behavioral, psychological, and economic research on the ad/adrd exposome. the nih requires awardees to implement a data management and sharing plan. applicants are required to provide an overarching data and resource sharing plan consistent with achieving the program's goals of sharing project information/findings, and common data construct/cde guidance.4. reportingwhen multiple years are involved, recipients will be required to submit the research performance progress report (rppr) annually and financial statements as required in the nih grants policy statement.a final rppr, invention statement, and the expenditure data portion of the federal financial report are required for closeout of an award, as described in the nih
