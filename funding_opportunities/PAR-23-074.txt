announcement (foa) is to encourage applications to phenotype and/or perform research on embryonic lethal knockout (ko) mouse strains being generated through the international mouse phenotyping consortium (impc) of which the nih knockout mouse phenotyping program (komp2) is a member. the mission of impc is to generate a comprehensive catalogue of mammalian gene function that will provide the foundation for functional analyses of human genetic variation. the current (july 19, 2022) impc data release includes phenotypic data for 8260 knockout genes. overall, the impc hopes to generate a null mutant and undertake broad-based phenotyping for every gene in the mouse genome. about 30% of these strains are expected to be either embryonic or perinatal lethal, or subviable. however, a large portion of homozygous lethal mutations are expected to have viable heterozygous phenotypes. the scientific community has the unique opportunity to leverage these mouse strains while they are being created and bred as part of the impc adult mouse phenotyping effort to perform additional in-depth phenotyping and research.30 days prior to application due dateall applications are due by 5:00 pm local time of applicant organization.applicants are encouraged to apply early to allow adequate time to make any corrections to errors found in the application during the submission process by the due date.not applicableit is critical that applicants follow the instructions in the research (r) instructions in the sf424 (r&r) application guide, except where instructed to do otherwise (in this foa or in a notice from nih guide for grants and contracts).conformance to all requirements (both in the application guide and the foa) is required and strictly enforced. applicants must read and follow all application instructions in the application guide as well as any program-specific instructions noted in section iv. when the program-specific instructions deviate from those in the application guide, follow the program-specific instructions.applications that do not comply with these instructions may be delayed or not accepted for review.there are several options available to submit your application through grants.gov to nih and department of health and human services partners. you must use one of these submission options to access the application forms for this opportunity.purposethe purpose of this funding opportunity announcement (foa) is two-fold: 1) to encourage submission of applications to do more in-depth phenotyping on investigator-selected cohorts of embryonic lethal or subviable knockout (ko) mouse strains generated by the international mouse phenotyping consortium (impc) of which the nih knockout mouse phenotyping program (komp) is a member; and, 2) to encourage submission of applications to use investigator-selected embryonic lethal, perinatal lethal, or subviable impc-generated ko mouse strains in hypothesis-driven research focused on placental defects, structural birth defects, and/or fertility issues. the komp2 program is in its final phase (2022-2027) of production and primary phenotyping of ko strains, and it is anticipated that the number of available strains for analyses by the research community will increase substantially.in-depth phenotyping and further research using embryonic lethal, perinatal lethal, and subviable ko mouse strains are of strategic importance for several reasons. most obviously, these genes are critical to embryonic growth, differentiation, and organogenesis. early lethals have defects in pre- and peri-implantation processes in embryonic or extra-embryonic tissues. mid-gestational lethals have defects in organogenesis. lethality in the fetal or immediate perinatal periods (late lethals) indicates failures in the transition to adult functioning organ systems. these mouse strains are extremely useful as models for a range of congenital human diseases, structural birth defects, infertility, and spontaneous miscarriage. viable heterozygote alleles are likely to be widely represented in human disease because of their haploinsufficiency or dominant phenotypic effects. so, there is significant and complementary value in also phenotyping heterozygote mutants of these ko strains for clinical phenotypes.backgroundthe mouse has long been an important mammalian model system for the study of gene function in human health and disease. mouse mutants with phenotypes that mimic human traits have served as critical research tools in understanding the genetics underlying mammalian biology. equally important, mouse mutants have been the tools used to begin to understand gene function and pathways as the science has moved from gene identification to mammalian functional genomics.in 2006, the trans-nih knockout mouse project (komp) was launched with the goal of generating ko mutations in 8,500 genes in c57bl/6 mouse lines by deleting all or most of the exons in target genes or producing knockout-first conditional ready alleles. together with the european conditional mouse mutagenesis program (eucomm) and the north american conditional mouse mutagenesis program (norcomm), these efforts produced knock out embryonic stem cells for 18,000 protein coding genes, as well as live mouse lines, frozen embryos and sperm, and vectors which are available from public repositories under the auspices of the international knockout mouse consortium (ikmc). the first phase of the komp program was completed in 2011.in 2011 the komp program was expanded as the knockout mouse phenotyping program (komp2), funded as a joint trans-nih and common fund program, with the goal of generating and phenotyping mice strains. since its launch, komp2 integrated operations with other members of the international mouse phenotyping consortium (impc). adoption of crispr technology in 2014 greatly increased the efficiency of this program. the current (july 19, 2022) impc data release includes phenotype data for 8260 knockout genes.the current phase of the komp2 program was funded in 2022 to extend the trans-nih program for additional five years (2022-2027). the purpose is to support production of approximately 1,200 mutant mouse lines using crispr/cas9 technology and perform a series of phenotyping assays; representing substantive contribution to completion of all high priority mouse:human orthologs.scopea tiered triage approach to the phenotyping of embryonic lethal ko strains to facilitate flexibility in experimental design and economize on breeding strategies is in place. primary tier screening begins with a careful evaluation of genotype ratios during breeding to generate adult cohorts for the adult phenotyping pipeline. a mid-gestation stage of e12.5 is the initial reference time point for a "first look" at strains deemed embryonic lethal or subviable and for assessment of developmental anomalies. based on the e12.5 analysis, embryos are triaged for further analyses at either earlier or later time points (e.g., e9.5 or e14.5 in komp or e18.5 across other impc centers) as recommended by the bloomsbury report. the established phenotyping pipeline includes collection of robust, three-dimensional imaging datasets that are accessible and free to be mined through the impc data portal (http://www.mousephenotype.org/data/embryo). in addition to the embryonic lethal ko strains, it is important to note two other cohorts of interest: the estimated 15% of perinatal lethal ko strains and 10% of subviable ko strains. these represent cohorts for further study as these are likely to represent models of human structural birth defects as well.depending upon the data available from the embryonic lethal pipeline primary tier screening being performed by the impc centers, investigators may consider three options when applying for funding through this foa:research interests of participating institutesthe participating nih institutes have provided a brief outline of their interests as they relate to the goals of this foa. these mission statements are intended to indicate the breadth of the biomedical areas of interest.nichdthe nichd is interested in the evaluation and use of embryonic lethal, perinatal lethal, and subviable ko strains exhibiting structural and other defects in embryonic development. this includes, but is not restricted to, defects affecting post-implantation development, gastrulation and organogenesis, especially those that affect multiple organ systems; limb, neural, cardio-vascular, musculoskeletal, urogenital, digestive, and respiratory. additionally, understanding potential links between fertility status and any co-morbid conditions in the subviable ko strains would be of interest. finally, evaluation and use of ko lines with defects in trophoblast development, allantois-chorion fusion, or other aspects of placental development or function are of interest. the focus should be on the determination of placental etiology resulting in embryonic lethality at the pathohistological and molecular levels as well as delineating the possible regulatory mechanism(s) affected by loss of gene function.nidcrthe nidcr supports research into all areas of dental, oral, and craniofacial biology including but not limited to: aspects of craniofacial development such as neural crest migration and the regulation and disorders thereof; mineralized tissues; and, salivary gland development and function. studies characterizing embryonic, perinatal, and adult phenotypes of ko mice relevant to dental, oral, and craniofacial biology are welcome.orwhthe office of research on women’s health (orwh) is part of the nih office of the director, and works in partnership with the 28 nih institutes, centers, and offices (icos) to ensure that women's health research is part of the nih scientific framework and supported throughout the biomedical enterprise. orwh uses a multidimensional framework to represent the intersection of factors that underlie patterns of disease and determinants of health outcomes in populations.orwh is interested in supporting biomedical research that considers sex and/or gender influences and includes adequate plans for collecting and reporting sex-specific data. there is a crucial need to address sex and/or gender influences in basic, translational, interdisciplinary, behavioral, clinical, and/or health services research relevant to women's health, and, where appropriate, include both sexes to better understand the influence of sex as a biological variable (sabv) on health and disease. integrating the purposeful accounting for sabv in biomedical research, from the most basic to the clinical and applied efforts, will fill gaps in our knowledge, and will inform more effective and personalized approaches for women and men. for additional guidance, please review the 2019-2023 trans-nih strategic plan for the health of women

considerations. thus, criteria in research protocols that target or exclude certain populations are warranted where nondiscriminatory justifications establish that such criteria are appropriate with respect to the health or safety of the subjects, the scientific study design, or the purpose of the research. for additional guidance regarding how the provisions apply to nih grant programs, please contact the scientific/research contact that is identified in section vii under agency contacts of this foa.please contact the hhs office for civil rights for more information about obligations and
