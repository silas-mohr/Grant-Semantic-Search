clinical trial required)national institute on deafness and other communication disorders (nidcd)the purpose of this notice of special interest (nosi) is to encourage applications for research on hearing health care in adults in support of improving access and affordability. further research is needed to strengthen the evidence base with a goal of delivering better hearing health care outcomes in adults.backgroundhearing loss (hl) is a leading public health concern. untreated hl significantly impacts communication abilities and quality of life, and has serious psychosocial and economic ramifications. approximately 17 percent of american adults, or 36 million people, report some degree of hl. age-related hearing loss is of increasing public health concern as the older adult population grows. globally, hearing loss has been identified as the fifth leading cause of years lived with disability.hearing aids remain the primary treatment modality for individuals with chronic sensorineural hl. yet, fewer than 20 percent of those with hl who require assistance seek intervention for their condition, even when they report substantial hearing difficulties. this is due to many reasons, including the perceived and actual benefits of hearing health care (hhc), the perceived need for hhc, the high cost, confusing access, stigma, and value (benefit relative to price) associated with hearing aids. in the adult hhc system, most costs are out of pocket and the costs are relatively high. medicare does not cover the cost of hearing aids or associated services, and the vast majority of employers do not provide hhc insurance. even when a hearing aid is obtained, its use may be curtailed or discontinued because of perceived lack of benefit, interference from background noise, or sound quality. before seeking a hearing aid, most hearing aid users have lived with hl for more than 10 years, and their impairment has progressed to moderate-to-severe levels. for many reasons the needs of the vast majority of adults with hl are not being met.to further explore this problem, the nidcd/nih convened a panel of scientific experts on accessible and affordable hearing health care for adults with mild to moderate hearing loss in august 2009. the panel developed a research agenda to increase the accessibility and affordability of hhc for adults with mild to moderate hearing hl. an extensive inventory of research recommendations was outlined. these extensive recommendations remain timely, and seek quality solutions that are effective, affordable, and deliverable to those who need them as well as implementable and sustainable in settings beyond the research environment. a summary of the panel’s report with the accompanying suggestions can be found at:http://www.nidcd.nih.gov/funding/programs/09hhc/summary.htm.in june 2016, the national academies of science, engineering, and medicine (nasem), released a consensus study report entitled "hearing health care for adults: priorities for improving access and affordability" (http://nationalacademies.org/hmd/reports/2016/hearing-health-care-for-adults.aspx). the nasem report focused on improving the accessibility and affordability of hhc for adults of all ages, and encompassed the range of services (e.g., diagnosis and evaluation, auditory rehabilitation) and hearing technologies (hearing aid and hearing assistive technologies) relevant to adult hearing loss. the numerous research recommendations included in the report were designed to lead to a hhc system that allows a range of solutions, provides a person-centered, person-directed continuum of care across the life span, provides improved outcomes, and allows for an integrated approach that provides a variety of options.purpose and research objectivesthis nosi encourages applications on hearing loss and hearing health care in adults in support of improving access and affordability. further research is needed to strengthen the evidence base with a goal of delivering better hearing health care outcomes in adults.nidcd encourages applications addressing the research recommendations in the 2009 nidcd research workshop on aahhc
