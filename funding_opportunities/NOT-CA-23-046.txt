february 23, 2023pa-20-272 - administrative supplements to existing nih grants and cooperative agreements (parent admin supp clinical trial optional)national cancer institute (nci)the purpose of this notice is to encourage currently funded nci extramural investigators to apply for administrative supplements to conduct systematic evidence reviews assessing the state of the science on the clinical utility (cu) of cancer-site specific polygenic risk scores (prs) for cancer risk assessment and inform future trials and research directions for clinical translation and implementation. the goals of this supplement opportunity are to 1) identify the potential for cu of cancer-site specific prs for cancer risk assessment; 2) describe the state of the science in terms of cancer-site specific prs development and evaluation; 3) assess the current evidence for efficacy and/or effectiveness of prs cu and potential benefits and harms of their clinical use (including consideration of available screening and prevention interventions based on risk); and 4) propose criteria and optimal study designs and methods for which prs are candidates for evaluation of cu through clinical trials.backgroundthe development of prs for cancer risk assessment has the potential to clarify risk assessment and improve preventive care and risk management. here we are referring to prs as mathematical models that use germline genetic information to estimate cancer risk. prior to the development of prs, risk models were based on family history and other known risk factors. studies have been conducted to assess the validity of prs as estimates of risk, comparing prs to other models of risk, and examining the validity of models combining prs with other risk factors. models have been developed for a variety of different types of cancers, including breast, prostate, ovarian, lung, colorectal, pancreatic, head and neck, kidney, and melanoma. the development, evaluation, and implementation of prs alone or combined with other risk models for cancer risk assessment are complex and it is critical that these models are thoroughly evaluated prior to implementation to ensure that they can be effectively used in clinical practice to improve patient outcomes.while prs have the potential to improve cancer risk assessment and preventive care, additional research is needed to understand issues related to evaluation and establishment of cu prior to clinical implementation. the determination of cu involves the identification of the clinical benefits and harms of the use of prs in terms of patient outcomes, ideally evaluated in randomized controlled trials. before clinical use, the validity of the scores must be established. factors to consider for validity include sensitivity, specificity, and discriminatory value to identify those at risk. clinical utility considers whether the use of prs guides appropriate clinical management and the benefits and harms of clinical use. implementation of prs, once cu is established, may consider additional factors such as positive and negative predictive value. a clear understanding of the cu of prs would allow for the development of guideline-driven care that is linked to a specific threshold of risk and appropriate intervention.research objectivesthe research objective of this nosi is to conduct a systematic evidence review on the cu of cancer-site specific prs for cancer risk assessment. (prs for cancer prognosis should not be included in the systematic reviews.) the review should include a detailed description and discussion of cancer-site-specific prs with respect to their development and validation and describe what is known about the efficacy and/or effectiveness of their application for guiding risk management, and potential harms and benefits associated with the clinical use of prs. in addition, the review should propose criteria for which prs are candidates for evaluation of cu through clinical trials and discuss the optimal study designs and methods to assess efficacy and effectiveness. the review should emphasize issues and challenges as it relates to evaluating the cu of prs for significant clinical and public health outcomes including descriptions of ongoing and proposed research studies.each proposal should include a systematic review of prs for two or more cancer-specific sites, excluding breast, prostate, and colorectal cancers, and address the following:questions that should be addressed and discussed include:the completed systematic review must be submitted for publication in an open-access, peer-reviewed journal.applications for this initiative must be submitted using the following opportunity or its subsequent reissued equivalent.all instructions in the sf424 (r&r) application guide and pa-20-272 must be followed, with the following additions:eligibility and eligible individuals (program director/principal investigator)budgetrequestspage limits â€“ these sections have the following limits:review and selection processnci program staff will evaluate applications taking into consideration the following factors:applicants are strongly encouraged to discuss their application with the scientific/research contact listed below prior to submission to ensure responsiveness and facilitate processing of the application.please direct all inquiries to:nonniekaye shelburnenational cancer institute (nci)telephone: 240-276-6897email: nshelburne@nih.govweekly toc for this announcement nih funding opportunities and noticesnote: for help accessing pdf, rtf, ms word, excel, powerpoint, audio or video files, see help downloading files.
