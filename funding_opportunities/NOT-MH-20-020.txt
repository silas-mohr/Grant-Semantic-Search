grant (parent t32)issued by national institute of mental health (nimh)purposethis notice calls for research on understanding and addressing the impact of stigma or other social determinants of health as they relate to hiv prevention and treatment for socially disadvantaged populations.stigma and other social determinants of health, that is, those social conditions and economic circumstances that influence health, are known barriers to hiv prevention and hiv treatment. for example, stigma related to hiv or other intersecting forces of discrimination or disadvantage (intersectional stigma or intersectional discrimination), socio-economic factors such as homelessness, lack of employment and having no high school education are all associated with increased risk of hiv in cities or regions with high hiv/aids prevalence. remaining in school is associated with delayed sexual debut and potentially reduces risk of hiv acquisition among young girls in sub-saharan africa. the mechanisms through which stigma and other social determinants exert their effect may include but are not limited to the following multi-level factors: social/interpersonal (e.g., social capital, social cohesion, culture), and systems/community (e.g., unemployment, legislation, access to health care, institutionalized racism, policies).many studies are cross-sectional and focus on one type of stigma or a limited set of social determinants and by doing so, miss an opportunity to understand the mechanisms by which stigma or other social determinants are interrelated and interact to impact hiv prevention and hiv treatment outcomes. there is a specific interest in understanding mutable mechanisms by which stigma or other social determinants exert their effects, at multiple levels that could be targeted for intervention. the field would also benefit from a greater understanding of protective factors and resilience, particularly why some individuals, despite facing intersectional stigma or discrimination and living in highly disadvantaged environments, are able to maintain their health. research that characterizes the social and structural conditions (e.g., culture, community organization) which facilitate resilience is particularly encouraged. filling these research gaps is fundamental to the development of effective structural and/or multi-level interventions to prevent hiv and improve hiv care outcomes.this notice solicits theoretically-driven research grant applications which will: 1) advance measurements of intersectional stigma (or discrimination) or other social determinants of health to examine the mechanisms and pathways by which they are a barrier to hiv prevention and hiv treatment; or 2) develop and test interventions to address their impact to improve hiv prevention and hiv treatment outcomes.applicants are strongly encouraged to utilize community-informed participatory research approaches to meaningfully engage communities most impacted by social determinants in hiv to help frame research questions and approach and to synthesize findings in order to inform effective policy and programming. research teams are encouraged to include experts across disciplines, sectors, conditions and communities. the strategic integration of mixed methodologies is also strongly encouraged. finally, non-intervention research applications should clearly indicate how this is the first step in a planned program of research that would inform future interventions to reduce the impact of social determinants of health on hiv prevention and treatment outcomes.areas of research interestresearch to understand and address stigma or other social determinants of health in hiv, including, but not limited to:it is strongly recommended that applicants review the nimh division of aids research current funding opportunity announcements (available on our website at https://www.nimh.nih.gov/about/organization/dar/aids-related-funding-opportunity-announcements-foas.shtml), and consult with a program officer before application submission.the nimh has published updated policies and guidance for investigators regarding human research protection and clinical research data and safety monitoring (not-mh-15-025). the application’s protection of human subjects section and data and safety monitoring plans should reflect the policies and guidance in this notice. plans for the protection of research subjects and data and safety monitoring will be reviewed by the nimh for consistency with nimh and nih policies and federal regulations.application and submission informationthis notice applies to due dates on or after may 7, 2020 and subsequent receipt dates through september 8, 2022.submit applications for this initiative using one of the following funding opportunity announcements (foas) or any reissues of these announcement through the expiration date
