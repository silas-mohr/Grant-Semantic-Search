answer questions from potential applicants.the overall goal of the nih research career development program is to help ensure that a diverse pool of highly trained scientists is available in appropriate scientific disciplines to address the nation's biomedical, behavioral, and clinical research needs. nih institutes and centers (ics) support a variety of mentored and non-mentored career development award programs designed to foster the transition of new investigators to research independence and to support established investigators in achieving specific objectives. candidates should review the different career development (k) award programs to determine the best program to support their goals. more information about career programs may be found at the nih extramural training mechanisms website.the objective of the nih pathway to independence award (k99/r00) is to help outstanding postdoctoral researchers complete needed, mentored training and transition in a timely manner to independent, tenure-track or equivalent faculty positions. the k99/r00 award is intended to foster the development of a creative, independent research program that will be competitive for subsequent independent funding and that will help advance the mission of the nih. applicants must have no more than 4 years of postdoctoral research experience at the time of the initial or the subsequent resubmission. the k99/r00 award is intended for individuals who require at least 12 months of mentored research training and career development (k99 phase) before transitioning to the r00 award phase of the program. consequently, the strongest applicants will require, and will propose, a well-conceived plan for 1–2 years of substantive mentored research training and career development that will help them become competitive candidates for tenure-track faculty positions and prepare them to launch robust, independent research programs. an individual who cannot provide a compelling rationale for at least one year of additional mentored research training at the time of award is not a strong candidate for this award.individuals must be in mentored, postdoctoral training positions to be eligible to apply to the k99/r00 program. if an applicant achieves independence (any faculty or non-mentored research position) before a k99 award is made, neither the k99, nor the r00 award, will be made. the k99/r00 award will provide up to 5 years of support in two phases. the initial (k99) phase will provide support for up to 2 years of mentored postdoctoral research training and career development. the second (r00) phase will provide up to 3 years of independent research support, which is contingent on satisfactory progress during the k99 phase and an approved, independent, tenure-track (or equivalent) faculty position. the two award phases are intended to be continuous in time. therefore, although exceptions may be possible in limited circumstances, r00 awards will generally only be made to those k99 pds/pis who accept independent, tenure-track (or equivalent) faculty positions by the end of the k99 award period.background informationthe national institutes of health (nih) recognizes the need to diversify the scientific workforce by enhancing the participation of individuals from groups identified as underrepresented in the biological, clinical, behavioral, and social sciences (collectively termed "biomedical") research workforce. diversity at all levels — from the kinds of science to the regions in which it is conducted to the backgrounds of the people conducting it — contributes to excellence in research training environments and strengthens the research enterprise. while the proportion of graduates from underrepresented groups in biomedical programs is increasing slightly, the representation of these groups in later career stages remains small (see http://www.nsf.gov/statistics/wmpd/).the national alzheimer's project act (napa), enacted into public law in january 2011, is a detailed plan that directs activities, drives the development of recommendations, and monitors progress on alzheimer's disease (ad) and ad-related dementias (adrd). to provide a living framework for napa, the u.s. department of health and human services (hhs) proposed the national plan to address alzheimer’s disease in 2012, which is organized into five strategic goals. goal 1 of the national plan is to prevent and effectively treat (delay onset, slow progression of) ad/adrd by 2025. to achieve this ambitious goal, the national plan has recognized a critical need to increase the number of health professionals and researchers, including those from underrepresented groups, who are trained to meet the expanding demand for cognitive impairment and dementia diagnosis, care, and research.purposethe specific purpose of this funding opportunity announcement (foa) is to assist eligible postdoctoral researchers from diverse backgrounds with their transition to tenure-track or equivalent faculty positions and establishment of independent research programs in the field of ad/adrd. the ninds ad/adrd k99/r00 program is intended to foster the development of a creative, independent researcher that will be competitive for subsequent independent funding and that will help advance the mission of the nih and ad/adrd research areas in particular. it is expected that the proposed research be rigorously designed, executed, analyzed, and interpreted (https://grants.nih.gov/policy/reproducibility/index.htm).applications appropriate for this foa may propose biomedical research across the spectrum of ad/adrd, including ad, lewy body dementia, vascular contributions to cognitive impairment and dementia, frontotemporal dementia, and mixed dementias, especially mixed with cerebrovascular disease or lewy bodies. the pre-symptomatic, early symptomatic, and dementia stages of these diseases and syndromes can be addressed. applications may include, but are not limited to, the following research areas:program considerationsindividuals must be in mentored, postdoctoral training positions to be eligible to apply to the k99/r00 program. the k99 is not intended to extend time in the postdoctoral lab while an individual is on the job market. individuals who are applying or interviewing for tenure track (or equivalent) faculty positions at research-intensive institutions are not the intended candidates for the ad/adrd k99/r00 transition award. if an applicant achieves independence (any faculty or non-mentored research position) before a k99 award is made, neither the k99, nor the r00 award, will be made.the k99/r00 award will provide up to 5 years of support in two phases. the initial (k99) phase will provide support for up to 2 years of mentored postdoctoral research training and career development. the second (r00) phase will provide up to 3 years of independent research support, which is contingent on satisfactory progress during the k99 phase and an approved, independent, tenure-track (or equivalent) faculty position. the two award phases are intended to be continuous in time. although exceptions may be possible in limited circumstances, r00 awards will generally only be made to those k99 pds/pis who accept independent, tenure-track (or equivalent) faculty positions by the end of the k99 award period.additional information for physician-scientists: for the purposes of this program, physician-scientists include individuals with an md, do, dds/dmd, dvm/vmd, or nurses with research doctoral degrees who devote the majority of their time to biomedical research. the k99/r00 is intended for those physician-scientists who already have substantial research training and are dedicated to initiating a strong, research-intensive career as physician-scientists. the k99/r00 program is designed to facilitate a timely transition of outstanding physician-scientists from mentored, research positions to independent, tenure-track or equivalent faculty positions, and to provide independent nih research support during the transition. individuals who need a longer period of mentored career development before they are prepared to begin the transition to research independence should consider the k08 or k23 program (see: k kiosk).applicants must have no more than 4 years of postdoctoral research experience at the time of the initial or the subsequent resubmission application. candidates are strongly encouraged to apply no later than the third year of their postdoctoral training to ensure awardees receive maximum benefit from both the k99 phase of the award and to facilitate a timely transition to independence.the k99/r00 award is intended for individuals who require at least 12 months of mentored research training and career development (k99 phase) before transitioning to the r00 award phase of the program. consequently, the strongest applicants will require and propose a well-conceived plan for 1–2 years of substantive mentored research training and career development that will help them become competitive candidates for tenure-track faculty positions and prepare them to launch robust, independent research programs. an individual who cannot provide a compelling rationale for at least one year of additional mentored research training at the time of award is not a strong candidate for this award (e.g., individuals who are actively applying or interviewing for independent positions at research-intensive institutions). if an applicant achieves independence (any faculty or non-mentored research position) before a k99 award is made, neither the k99, nor the r00 award, will be made.pre-submission consultationapplicants are strongly encouraged to consult with nih scientific/research staff as early as possible before the due date when planning an application. early contact provides an opportunity for nih scientific/research staff to provide guidance on program scope and appropriateness of the proposed research and training for potential funding in response to this foa.note: this funding opportunity announcement (foa) is designed specifically for applicants proposing research that does not involve leading an independent clinical trial, a clinical trial feasibility study, or a separate ancillary clinical trial. applicants to this foa are permitted to propose research experience in a clinical trial led by a mentor or co-mentor.see section viii. other information for award authorities and regulations.grant: a support mechanism providing money, property, or both to an eligible entity to carry out an approved project or activity.the oer glossary and the sf424 (r&r) application guide provide details on these application types.note: applicants may propose to gain experience in a clinical trial led by a mentor/co-mentor as part of their research career development.need help determining whether you are doing a clinical trial?ninds intends to fund an estimate of 3 awards, corresponding to a total of $450,000, in fiscal year 2022. future year amounts will depend on annual appropriations and the submission of a sufficient number of meritorious applications.mentored phase (k99)ninds will provide up to $75,000 per year for salary support, plus fringe, and up to $20,000 for research support costs. for applicants with medical degrees who are licensed to practice, ninds will provide up to $125,000 per year for salary support. applicants must commit a minimum of 9 person months effort to the k99/r00 research during both phases of the award (note: neurosurgeons must commit a minimum of 6 person months effort to the k99/r00 research during both phases of the award). further guidance on budgeting for career development salaries is provided in the sf424 (r&r) application guide. see also not-od-17-094intramural: mentored candidates in the nih intramural program will be supported by intramural funds provided by the nih institute/center intramural laboratory in which they are conducting their research. budget details for the mentored phase will be negotiated with the sponsoring intramural laboratory. salary will be consistent with that offered scientists in similar, intramural nih positions.extramural: mentored candidates at an extramural sponsoring institution/organization will be supported by nih extramural funds. the requested salary must be consistent both with the established salary structure at the institution and with salaries actually provided by the institution from its own funds to other staff members with equivalent qualifications, rank, and responsibilities in the department concerned. further guidance on budgeting for career development salaries is provided in the sf424 (r&r) application guide.the total nih contribution to salary may not exceed the legislatively mandated salary cap. see: http://grants.nih.gov/grants/policy/salcap_summary.htm.independent phase (r00)the total cost for the independent phase (r00) may not exceed $249,000 per year. this amount includes salary, fringe benefits, research costs, and applicable indirect costs. indirect costs will be reimbursed at the extramural sponsoring institution's indirect cost rate.research development costs must be justified and consistent with the stage of development of the candidate and the proportion of time to be spent in research or career development activities. expenses may include (a) tuition and fees related to career development activities; (b) supplies, equipment and technical personnel; (c) statistical services including personnel and computer time; and (d) expenses to attend relevant scientific meetings.salary for mentors, secretarial and administrative assistants, etc. is not allowed.higher education institutionsthe following types of higher education institutions are always encouraged to apply for nih support as public or private institutions of higher education:nonprofits other than institutions of higher educationfor-profit organizationsgovernmentsthe sponsoring institution may be private (profit or nonprofit) or public, including the nih intramural programs and other federal laboratories.the applicant institution will be the mentored phase (k99) institution. all institution/organization types listed above are eligible for both the mentored (k99) and independent (r00) phase, with the following exceptions: (1) eligible agencies of the federal government, such as the nih intramural program, are eligible only for the mentored phase; and (2) eligibility of organizations, other than institutions of higher education, for the r00 phase depends on the nature of the appointment, and the ability of the pd/pi to conduct independent research and apply for nih research (r01 or r01-equivalent) grants.applicant organizationsapplicant organizations must complete and maintain the following registrations as described in the sf 424 (r&r) application guide to be eligible to apply for or receive an award. all registrations must be completed prior to the application being submitted. registration can take 6 weeks or more, so applicants should begin the registration process as soon as possible. the nih policy on late submission of grant applications states that failure to complete registrations in advance of a due date is not a valid reason for a late submission.program directors/principal investigators (pd(s)/pi(s))all pd(s)/pi(s) must have an era commons account. pd(s)/pi(s) should work with their organizational officials to either create a new account or to affiliate their existing account with the applicant organization in era commons. if the pd/pi is also the organizational signing official, they must have two distinct era commons accounts, one for each role. obtaining an era commons account can take up to 2 weeks.any candidate with the skills, knowledge, and resources necessary to carry out the proposed research as the program director/principal investigator (pd/pi) is invited to work with his/her mentor and organization to develop an application for support. individuals from underrepresented racial and ethnic groups as well as individuals with disabilities are always encouraged to apply for nih support. multiple pds/pis are not allowed.k99/r00 applicants must have no more than 4 years of postdoctoral research experience as of the relevant application due date regardless of whether it is a new or resubmission application. individuals must be in mentored, postdoctoral training positions to be eligible to apply to the k99/r00 program. if an applicant achieves independence (i.e., any faculty or non-mentored research position) before a k99 award is made, neither the k99 award, nor the r00 award, will be issued.parental, medical, or other well-justified leave for personal or family situations of generally less than 12 months duration is not included in the 4-year eligibility limit, nor is clinical training with no research involvement (e.g., full-time residency training). nih will approve an extension of one year for childbirth within the 4 year k99 eligibility window. applicants who will be pd/pis on a k99 application must provide the child’s date of birth in the extension request justification submitted to ic program officials and/or scientific/research contacts listed in the foa at least 12 weeks before submitting an application. part-time postdoctoral research training, related to personal or family situations or occurring during a research residency or fellowship, will be pro-rated accordingly. in addition, time spent conducting postgraduate clinical training that does not involve research is not considered as part of the 4-year research training eligibility limit. only time dedicated to research activities counts toward the 4-year limit.additional clarifications are provided under frequently asked questions.by the time of award, the individual must be a citizen or a non-citizen national of the united states or have been lawfully admitted for permanent residence (i.e., possess a currently valid permanent resident card uscis form i-551, or other legal verification of such status). potential candidates are encouraged to discuss their individual situation with an nih institute or center scientific program contact listed in section vii before applying. k99/r00 applicants must have no more than 4 years of postdoctoral research experience as of the relevant application due date regardless of whether it is a new or resubmission application. individuals must be in mentored, postdoctoral training positions to be eligible to apply to the k99/r00 program. if an applicant achieves independence (i.e., any faculty or non-mentored research position) before a k99 award is made, neither the k99 award, nor the r00 award, will be issued.enhancing diversitythe overarching goal of this program is to enhance the diversity of independent investigators conducting research on ad/adrd. fostering diversity by addressing underrepresentation in the scientific research workforce is a key component of the nih strategy to identify, develop, support and maintain the quality of our scientific human capital. in spite of tremendous advancements in scientific research, information, educational and research opportunities are not equally available to all. nih encourages institutions to diversify their student, post-doctorate, and faculty populations to enhance the participation of individuals from groups identified as underrepresented in the biomedical sciences (see not-od-20-031, notice of nih’s interest in diversity).for the purpose of this announcement, institutions are encouraged to identify candidates who will enhance diversity on a national basis. in addition, it is recognized that underrepresentation can vary from setting to setting; individuals from racial or ethnic groups that can be demonstrated convincingly to be underrepresented by the grantee institution should be encouraged to participate in this program. a clear commitment to enhancing diversity in the biomedical research workforce is required from the institutional environment letter.candidates for the k99/r00 award must have a clinical or research doctorate (including phd, md, do, dc, nd, dds, dmd, dvm, scd, dns, pharmd or equivalent doctoral degrees). clinicians (including those with md, dds, dvm and other licensed health professionals) in a clinical faculty position that denotes independence in clinical responsibilities but not in research may also be eligible for the k99/r00 award. individuals are not eligible if they:ph.d. (or equivalent research doctorate degree) candidates in positions other than postdoctoral fellow positions: it is recognized that some institutions appoint postdoctoral fellows in positions with other titles although they are still in non-independent, mentored training positions. candidates in such positions are encouraged to obtain confirmation of their eligibility from the relevant ic before they begin to prepare their applications. it is incumbent upon the candidate to provide evidence that his or her position complies with the intent of this eligibility requirement. if a potential applicant is in a position that is not clearly identifiable as a postdoctoral training position, candidate should provide the relevant nih institute or center an official statement of the institution’s policy (e.g. published position description in an official institutional document) which documents the position as a mentored, postdoctoral training position. clinicians (including those with m.d., d.d.s, d.v.m. and other licensed professionals) in positions not designated as postdoctoral positions: following clinical training or fellowship training periods, clinicians often obtain a clinical faculty position that denotes independence in clinical responsibilities but not in research. a clinical faculty member who does not hold an independent research faculty position may be eligible for the k99/r00 award, and should contact a program director at the relevant nih institute for guidance. clinicians in such positions are encouraged to obtain confirmation of their eligibility before they begin to prepare their applications. such individuals may also wish to consider other career awards (see k kiosk) available for junior faculty development. the following is provided as an aid to distinguish independent from non-independent positions: however, it is not sufficient merely to cite one or more of the following items to document eligibility. evidence for non-independence may include:conversely, evidence for independence, and therefore lack of eligibility, includes:applicant organizations may submit more than one application, provided that each application is scientifically distinct, and each is from a different candidate.the nih will not accept duplicate or highly overlapping applications under review at the same time. an individual may not have two or more competing nih career development applications pending review concurrently. in addition, nih will not accept:at the time of award, the candidate must have a “full-time” appointment at the academic institution. candidates are required to commit a minimum of 75% of full-time professional effort (i.e., a minimum of 9 person-months) to their program of career development. candidates may engage in other duties as part of the remaining 25% of their full-time professional effort not covered by this award, as long as such duties do not interfere with or detract from the proposed career development program.candidates who have va appointments may not consider part of the va effort toward satisfying the full time requirement at the applicant institution. candidates with va appointments should contact the staff person in the relevant institute or center prior to preparing an application to discuss their eligibility.after the receipt of the award, adjustments to the required level of effort may be made in certain circumstances. see not-od-09-036 for more details.r00 phase. although candidates are required to devote no less than 75% of their full-time, 12-month professional effort to research (i.e., full-time for 9 person-months), the required 9 person-months of research effort need not be devoted exclusively to the r00-supported research.mentor(s)before submitting the application, the candidate must identify a mentor who will supervise the proposed career development and research experience in the field of ad/adrd. the mentor should be an active investigator in the area of the proposed research and be committed both to the career development of the candidate and to the direct supervision of the candidate’s research. the mentor must document the availability of sufficient research support and facilities for high-quality research. candidates are encouraged to identify more than one mentor, i.e., a mentoring team, if this is deemed advantageous for providing expert advice in all aspects of the research career development program. in such cases, one individual must be identified as the primary mentor who will coordinate the candidate’s research. the candidate must work with the mentor(s) in preparing the application. the mentor, or a member of the mentoring team, should have a successful track record of mentoring individuals at the candidate’s career stage. where feasible, women, individuals from diverse racial and ethnic groups, and individuals with disabilities should be involved as mentors to serve as role models.the mentor(s) or mentoring team must demonstrate appropriate expertise, experience, and ability to guide the applicant in the organization, management and implementation of the proposed research. for this foa, the composition of the mentoring team should reflect knowledge and experience requisite for guiding the applicant's career development in the ad/adrd field.the applicant institution must have a strong, well-established record of research and career development activities and faculty qualified to serve as mentors in biomedical or clinical research in the field of ad/adrd. the applicant institution should have a clear commitment to enhancing diversity in the biomedical research workforce and promoting inclusive and supportive scientific research environments, as described in the institutional environment letter.buttons to access the online assist system or to download application forms are available in part 1 of this foa. see your administrative office for instructions if you plan to use

described in the nih grants policy statement.a formal notification in the form of a notice of award (noa) will be provided to the applicant organization for successful applications. the noa signed by the grants management officer is the authorizing document and will be sent via email to the recipient’s business official.awardees must comply with any funding restrictions described in section iv.5. funding restrictions. selection of an application for award is not an authorization to begin performance. any costs incurred before receipt of the noa are at the recipient's risk. these costs may be reimbursed only to the extent considered allowable pre-award costs.any application awarded in response to this foa will be subject to terms and conditions found on the award conditions and information for nih grants website. this includes any recent legislation and policy applicable to awards that is highlighted on this website.there will not be a formal notice of award (noa) associated with the k99 phase of the award conducted in the nih intramural program. the awarding institute will transmit to the successful candidate an approval letter which will include the terms and conditions of the nih intramural “k99” award, as well as expectations for the transition to the r00 phase of the award.individual awards are based on the application submitted to, and as approved by, the nih and are subject to the ic-specific terms and conditions identified in the noa.institutional review board or independent ethics committee approval: recipient institutions must ensure that all protocols are reviewed by their irb or iec. to help ensure the safety of participants enrolled in nih-funded studies, the awardee must provide nih copies of documents related to all major changes in the status of ongoing protocols.all nih grant and cooperative agreement awards include the nih grants policy statement as part of the noa. for these terms of award, see the nih grants policy statement part ii:

of race, color, national origin, disability, age and, in some circumstances, religion, conscience, and sex. this includes ensuring programs are accessible to persons with limited english proficiency. the hhs office for civil rights provides guidance on complying with civil rights laws enforced by hhs. please see https://www.hhs.gov/civil-rights/for-providers/provider-obligations/index.html and http://www.hhs.gov/ocr/civilrights/understanding/section1557/index.html.hhs recognizes that research projects are often limited in scope for many reasons that are nondiscriminatory, such as the principal investigator’s scientific interest, funding limitations, recruitment requirements, and other considerations. thus, criteria in research protocols that target or exclude certain populations are warranted where nondiscriminatory justifications establish that such criteria are appropriate with respect to the health or safety of the subjects, the scientific study design, or the purpose of the research. for additional guidance regarding how the provisions apply to nih grant programs, please contact the scientific/research contact that is identified in section vii under agency contacts

defense authorization act of fiscal year 2009 (public law 110-417), nih awards will be subject to thefederal awardee performance and integrity information system (fapiis) requirements. fapiis requires federal award making officials to review and consider information about an applicant in the designated integrity and performance system (currently fapiis) prior to making an award. an applicant, at its option, may review information in the designated integrity and performance systems accessible through fapiis and comment on any information about itself that a federal agency previously entered and is currently in fapiis. the federal awarding agency will consider any comments by the applicant, in addition to other information in fapiis, in making a judgement about the applicant’s integrity, business ethics, and record of performance under federal awards when completing the review of risk posed by applicants as described in 45 cfr part 75.205 “federal awarding agency review of risk posed by applicants.” this provision will apply to all nih grants and cooperative agreements except fellowships.transition to the independent phasetransition from the mentored phase to the independent phase is intended to be continuous in time and, except in unusual, extenuating circumstances, the awarding nih institute/center will not extend the k99 phase beyond the 2-year limit. ics may, at their discretion, make exceptions to this time limitation when individuals have been invited for faculty job interviews but final decisions have not yet been made by the potential r00 institution or, rarely, because of unusual, extenuating circumstances. to activate the independent phase of the grant, individuals must have been offered and accepted a tenure-track, full-time assistant professor position (or equivalent) by the end of the k99 project period.an eligible r00 institution will have appropriate infrastructure to support the proposed research program and a history of external research funding. applicants are free to apply for independent phase positions within the nih intramural research program (irp). however, should the individual accept such a position in the irp, the independent phase of the award will not be activated. this is because nih intramural scientists are supported directly by nih intramural funds and are not eligible for nih extramural grant awards. eligibility of for-profit organizations for the r00 phase depends on the nature of the appointment, and the ability of the pd/pi to conduct independent research and apply for nih r01 or r01-equivalent research grants. pis are encouraged to discuss job offers at for-profit organizations with nih program staff well in advance of accepting such an offer.to avoid potential problems in activating the independent phase, applicants are strongly encouraged to contact their nih program official as soon as plans to apply for and, assume an independent position develop, and not later than 6 months prior to the termination of the k99 phase of the award.at that time, individuals should discuss plans for transition to, and application for, the r00 phase with their nih program official. the application for the r00 phase of the award should be submitted no later than 2 months prior to the proposed activation date of the r00 award by the r00 phase recipient organization.the independent phase institution will submit an application on behalf of the candidate for the r00 award using the phs 398 application. the r00 application must include:these materials should be sent directly to the awarding institute or center (ic). the original application plus one copy (preferably in pdf format) are to be mailed (or e-mailed) to the financial or grants management contact person of the awarding nih institute or center listed in the notice of award. the r00 application will be evaluated by extramural program staff of the awarding component for completeness and appropriateness to the program.two additional documents are included with the r00 application. a letter from the r00 department or division chairman must be submitted that describes the r00 institution’s commitment to the candidate and plans for his/her career development (see below). if not already provided, the final evaluation statement by the k99 phase mentor, must be provided.in addition to space, facilities, resources, and other support needed to conduct the proposed research, the sponsoring institution must provide protected research time (minimum of 9 person-months or 75% of the candidate’s full time professional effort) at least for the duration of the r00 award. the start-up package and other institutional support must be described in detail and must be comparable to that given to other faculty recently hired into tenure-track or equivalent faculty positions. institutions must provide a startup and salary package equivalent to that provided to a newly hired faculty member who does not have a grant; r00 funds may not be used to offset the typical startup package or to offset the usual institutional commitment to provide salary for tenure-track (or equivalent) assistant professors who are hired without grant support. the r00 sponsoring institution must describe the candidate’s academic appointment, bearing in mind that it must be tenure-track assistant professor (or equivalent), and confirm that the appointment is not contingent on the transfer of the award to the institution. the r00 phase institution must describe how the awardee’s ability to apply for and secure independent research grant (r01) support will be fostered and supported during the r00 phase of the award.the r00 award requires that a minimum of 9 person-months (75% of the candidate’s full time professional effort) be devoted to research activities. consequently, teaching, clinical duties and other non-research activities should be minimal during the r00 award period. nih staff may review start-up packages and other commitments between the institution and candidate prior to activating the independent phase of the award. it is suggested that the applicant and/or the hiring institution discuss the institutional commitment with the relevant nih institute program official prior to finalizing the offer. nih will not activate the independent phase if the institutional commitment is deemed inadequate. applicants who are approved to transition will receive a notice of award reflecting the new r00 grant mechanism, the dollar amount, and the new recipient organization (if applicable).the k99/r00 award is intended to facilitate successful transition to independence. consequently, a requirement for activation of the r00 phase is successful completion of this transition. applicants are encouraged (but not required) to apply for independent positions at departments and institutions different from where they conducted their mentored research. it is important for all applicants, but especially so for applicants who intend to stay at the mentored phase institution for the independent phase, to provide a plan by which they will separate from their mentor and advance to independence. awardees are also encouraged to include a plan and timeline for submitting an independent research grant application in a research area relevant to the mission of an nih awarding component.candidates who are not approved to transition will receive written notification from the awarding component communicating the rationale for the disapproval. this notification typically will be sent within 60 days of receipt of the r00 application.although the financial plans of the nih institute or center provide support for this program, awards pursuant to this funding opportunity are contingent upon the availability of funds.termination of the k99 award phaseif transition from the k99 phase at an extramural institution to the r00 phase occurs at the originally scheduled end date of the k99 award, then no specific steps to terminate the k99 award are necessary. if the transition at an extramural institution occurs prior to the scheduled end date, then a revised notice of award will be issued to terminate the k99 phase award. carry-over of unspent funds from a partially completed year in the k99 phase into the r00 phase may be permitted.data management and sharingnote: the nih policy for data management and sharing is effective for due dates on or after january 25, 2023.consistent with the nih policy for data management and sharing, when data management and sharing is applicable to the award, recipients will be required to adhere to the data management and sharing requirements as outlined in the nih grants policy statement. upon the approval of a data management and sharing plan, it is required for recipients to implement the plan as described.a final rppr, invention statement, and the expenditure data portion of the federal financial report are required for closeout of an award, as described in the nih grants policy statement.the federal funding accountability and transparency act of 2006 (transparency act), includes a requirement for awardees of federal grants to report information about first-tier subawards and executive compensation under federal assistance awards issued in fy2011 or later. all awardees of applicable nih grants and cooperative agreements are required to report to the federal subaward reporting system (fsrs) available at www.fsrs.gov on all subawards over $25,000. see the nih grants policy statement for additional information on this reporting requirement.in accordance with the regulatory requirements provided at 45 cfr 75.113 and appendix xii to 45 cfr part 75, recipients that have currently active federal grants, cooperative agreements, and procurement contracts from all federal awarding agencies with a cumulative total value greater than $10,000,000 for any period of time during the period of performance of a federal award, must report and maintain the currency of information reported in the system for award management (sam) about civil, criminal, and administrative proceedings in connection with the award or performance of a federal award that reached final disposition within the most recent five-year period. the recipient must also make semiannual disclosures regarding such proceedings. proceedings information will be made publicly available in the designated integrity and performance system (currently fapiis). this is a statutory requirement under section 872 of public law 110-417, as amended (41 u.s.c. 2313). as required by section 3010 of public law 111-212, all information posted in the designated integrity and performance system on or after april 15, 2011, except past performance reviews required for federal procurement contracts, will be publicly available. full reporting requirements and procedures are found in appendix xii to 45 cfr part 75 – award term and conditions for recipient integrity and performance matters.in carrying out its stewardship of human resource-related programs, the nih may request information essential to an assessment of the effectiveness of this program from databases and from participants themselves. participants may be contacted after the completion of this award for periodic updates on various aspects of their employment history, publications, support from research grants or contracts, honors and awards, professional activities, and other information helpful in evaluating the impact of the program.within
