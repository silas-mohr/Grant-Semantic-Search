institute (nci)the nih investigation of co-occurring conditions across the lifespan to understand down syndrome (include) project seeks to improve health and quality-of-life for individuals with down syndrome (ds). this notice of special interest (nosi) announces nih's continued support for administrative supplement applications for actively funded projects to meet nih down syndrome research objectives related to the nih include project as listed below.backgrounddown syndrome is the most common genetic cause of intellectual disability, the most common autosomal trisomy, and one of the most visible and universally recognized genetic syndromes. each year there are approximately 5300 babies born in the united states with down syndrome (ds). within the past 25 years, the average lifespan for a person with down syndrome has doubled, from 30 to 60 years. despite this increase in lifespan, individuals with down syndrome and their families face significant and changing health challenges with age, and they have often been excluded from participation in research that could improve their health outcomes and quality of life. while all people with down syndrome are connected by the common feature of a complete or partial copy of chromosome 21 (trisomy 21), there are significant physical and cognitive differences among them, indicating that inter-individual variability exists.down syndrome is associated with an increased prevalence of autism and epilepsy. about 75% of individuals experience cognitive decline in a syndrome that resembles alzheimer’s disease but has its onset a decade or two earlier than typical alzheimer’s disease. individuals with down syndrome also have high rates of hearing loss, eye abnormalities, congenital heart defects, sleep apnea, pulmonary hypertension, gastrointestinal malformations, thyroid disease, leukemia, and other autoimmune or immune dysregulation disorders including celiac disease. however, people with down syndrome infrequently develop solid tumors such as breast or prostate cancer, and despite multiple risk factors for coronary artery disease and high rates of obesity, sleep apnea, and type 1 diabetes, they rarely develop atherosclerosis or have myocardial infarctions. understanding this unique combination of risk and resiliencies will inform medical advances for individuals with down syndrome, and for individuals who do not have down syndrome but share these co-occurring conditions.this foa is one of several trans-nih research initiatives created in response to fiscal year 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, and 2022 omnibus appropriations reports, which encourage nih to expand its current efforts on down syndrome and common co-occurring conditions also seen in the general population, while increasing the pipeline of down syndrome investigators. together, the initiatives are called the include project (investigation of co-occurring conditions across the lifespan to understand down syndrome). information about projects that were funded in prior years, as well as the nih include down syndrome research plan, are available on the include project website at https://www.nih.gov/include-project/.research objectivesthe purpose of this notice of special interest (nosi) is to administrative supplement applications that are focused on down syndrome and that meet programmatic objectives for the include project. sharing of resources and effective communication of outputs to the broader communities are a high priority of the include project. applicants responding to this nosi are strongly encouraged to describe plans for rapid sharing of data and results as well as innovative data analytics approaches (see goal 3, nih strategic plan for data science).applications in response to this nosi should be aligned with the overall nih include project research plan, which consists of three components:applications will be considered eligible for funding if they:supplements to existing clinical trials are allowed. the proposed research must be within the scope of the parent clinical trial and the parent clinical trial award must have two or more budget years remaining in the current project period. the addition of a new clinical trial that was not a part of the parent award is not allowed. supplement requests addressing include components 2 or 3 should encourage participants with ds or their caregivers to register in ds-connect®: the down syndrome registry. for those applications that generate clinical data, it is expected that the data sharing plan will include the include data coordinating center (dcc; https://includedcc.org/). applications generating clinical data should describe the anticipated timelines, formats, and approach to submitting data to the include dcc.the include website has a list of funding priorities by institute and center, as well as list of contacts for each participating nih institute and center.award project periodto be eligible, the parent award must be active in the current fiscal year (i.e., the parent award received funds in the current fiscal year and is not in an extension period), and the research proposed in the supplement should be requested for one year. the awarding institute may consider a no-cost extension of up to an additional year at the conclusion of the first year.budgetrequests must reflect the actual needs of the proposed project. supplement budget requests that exceed $500,000 in direct costs or 50% of the direct costs of the current year of the parent award (exclusive of facilities and administrative costs on sub-contracts) must receive permission from the program officer for the parent award and ic contact prior to submission.eligible individuals (program director/principal investigator)individual(s) must hold an active grant or cooperative agreement. for supplements to parent awards that include multiple pds/pis, the supplement may be requested by any or all of the pds/pis (in accordance with the existing leadership plan) and submitted by the awardee institution of the parent award.application and submission information: applications in response to this nosi must be submitted to pa-20-272 administrative supplements to existing nih grants and cooperative agreements (parent admin supp clinical trial optional) or its subsequent reissued equivalent. all instructions in the sf424 (r&r) application guide and pa-20-272 must be followed, with the following additions:in order to ensure identification, tracking, and appropriate review of their applications, all applicants must follow these special instructions:additional considerations: to maximize comparisons across datasets or studies, and facilitate data integration and collaboration, researchers funded through this nosi are strongly encouraged to use the following standards and resources (where applicable):page limits: nih will consider supplements with a research strategy of no more than 6 pages.review process: each ic will conduct administrative reviews of applications from their ic separately.please direct all inquiries to:investigators planning to submit an application in response to this nosi are strongly encouraged to contact and discuss their proposed research/aims with a program officer from the appropriate institute or center listed on this nosi well in advance of the grant receipt date to better determine appropriateness and interest of the awarding ico.please direct all inquiries to the contact at the institute, center or office supporting the parent award as indicated on the funding page of the include project website.weekly toc for this announcement nih funding opportunities and noticesnote: for help accessing
