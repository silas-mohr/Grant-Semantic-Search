vulnerable populations.backgroundthe healthcare landscape in the united states is constantly changing, creating new challenges to the delivery of high-quality treatments and services to children, youth, adults, and older adults with unmet or under-met mental health needs. epidemiological findings suggest that approximately one-half of the united states population meets lifetime criteria for a mental disorder, and approximately one-quarter of the population meets criteria in any given year. however, only one-half of people with any mental health disorder and only two-thirds of people with a serious mental health disorder received mental health services in the previous year. of those that find their way into mental health care, many fall out of care and/or do not receive guideline concordant treatment, including suicide risk assessment and evidence-based preventive interventions. disparities in population status (e.g., members of racial, ethnic, sexual, and gender minority communities), a fragmented healthcare system, provider shortages, healthcare affordability, and other factors moderate these findings.digital health incorporates mobile health (mhealth) and health information technology (smartphones, wearable sensors, internet platforms, and electronic health records) with biological, social, and behavioral data. digital health technology offers unprecedented opportunities to help consumers, clinicians, and researchers measure, manage, and improve health and productivity. these tools also have the potential to improve our understanding of mental illness, to track the course of illnesses and recovery, and to provide and enhance mental health care. digital mental health interventions are treatments that aim to improve mental health and deliver the treatment as a standalone intervention or as an adjunct to face-to-face interventions via a digital health platform (including mobile phone, website, virtual reality systems, and offline computer programs). digital health interventions offer the potential to bridge the treatment gap and provide evidence-based interventions to the many individuals who currently are unable to access treatments.over the last decade, nimh has supported the development and testing of digital health technology, with a focus on establishing the efficacy of digital health assessments and digital health interventions. this research has demonstrated that digital health technology can be used to passively monitor clinical states and as a means for reducing symptoms. however, with few exceptions, the majority of nimh funded research of digital health interventions has not moved into or beyond the effectiveness stage of research. in contrast to federally funded mental health research, the pace of commercial technology development has progressed rapidly. over the last 5 years commercially available digital health platforms for mental health have gained considerable traction in the marketplace. recent estimates suggest that greater than 25% of commercially available digital health apps focus on mental health and a significant cross section of consumers are regularly utilizing digital health technology to access treatment for mental health. as digital health technology for mental health is being increasingly used to provide standalone self-managed interventions and/or to supplement in-person treatment, well-designed pragmatic research is necessary to evaluate the effectiveness of existing digital health technology, optimize existing digital health interventions, and examine factors related to uptake and engagement.research scope and objectivesthis foa uses the r01 mechanism and is intended promote partnerships between software developers and academic researchers and leverage existing digital mental health platform infrastructure. it is expected that the proposed digital mental health platforms will be well established, provide evidence-based interventions and have a substantial existing user base. it is also expected that these partnerships will enable applicants to conduct research both to rapidly test ideas and conduct exploratory research as well secondary data analyses and large cost-effective pragmatic effectiveness trials. while this foa will support testing of evidence-based digital health intervention approaches, it is not intended to support the translation of existing face-to-face treatments into technology-based applications.investigators are strongly encouraged to review not-mh-18-031 for guidance concerning the nimh high priority topics in digital mental health. for this foa, nimh requires investigators to develop and leverage partnerships with digital health developers and existing well-established digital health delivery platforms, so that the research follows a deployment-focused model of services design and testing. deployment-focused studies take into account the perspective of relevant stakeholders and key characteristics of settings intended to implement optimized digital mental health interventions. potential stakeholders include, but are not limited to, federal agencies (e.g., centers for medicare and medicaid services, substance abuse and mental health services administration, health resources and services administration, department of defense, department of veterans affairs); commercial health insurers/funders; public and commercial disability insurers; employers and other payers; delivery systems; professional/trade associations; accrediting and licensing organizations; medical education and other training programs; clinicians; vendors of information technology and other relevant products/services; service users; family members; and community organizations. the applicant should identify key stakeholders based on the characteristics of the proposed intervention and how the intervention will be deployed within service systems. such communication and collaboration will ensure findings are relevant and practical, create opportunities for research that is not otherwise feasible, and enable stakeholders to anticipate relevant research initiatives in their planning and activities. where appropriate, it is strongly encouraged that applicants seek consultation from the food and drug administration for guidance related to regulatory approval/certification of the digital mental health interventions that are being tested.consistent with the nimh experimental therapeutics approach to intervention development and testing, this foa is intended to support studies that not only examine the intervention effects on outcomes of interest, but also inform understanding of the intervention’s mechanisms of action. as such, the scope of work must include specification of intervention target(s)/mechanism(s) and assessment and analysis of intervention-induced changes in the presumed target(s)/mechanism(s) that are hypothesized to account for the intervention outcomes (see the nimh clinical trials web page for additional information).proposed studies should capitalize on existing infrastructure (e.g., existing evidence based digital mental health platforms) to increase the efficiency of participant recruitment, and data collection and management. platforms should be well established with a sufficient existing user base (i.e. at least a thousand or more users) to support nimble intervention refinement and testing with appropriate sample size to achieve adequate statistical power.of note, the goal of this funding announcement is not just to conduct pragmatic trials on digital health platforms. rather, applicants are also expected to propose additional research beyond the primary effectiveness trial that capitalize on the unique features of the proposed digital health platform. such additional research might include but is not limited to: analyses of baseline characteristics of users to develop treatment matching algorithms, analyses of existing data to determine the optimal sequence and dose of the digital intervention, development and testing of real time adaptive customized interventions that augment the base digital intervention.examples of responsive applications include, but are not limited to, studies that:test strategies to rapidly identify and enroll participants, and parametrically refine intervention content, dose, and delivery parameters to optimize the digital health intervention’s therapeutic benefit and efficiency.test the effectiveness of digital health platforms to optimize the benefit of in-person treatment and bridge therapy sessions and promote between-session skill practice/acquisition.develop and test adaptive interventions and just-in-time interventions that can be ‘pushed out’ via mobile technology based on information regarding the individual’s current state. for example, interventions that prompt users to complete an assessment at specific times during the day or passive ascertainment of changes in clinical status, immediately followed by provision of behavioral support, such as self-management strategies.test strategies to deliver digital mental health interventions designed to overcome well-documented uptake and adherence challenges with digital health interventions (e.g., using research-informed approaches to enhance motivation and promote continued engagement).test digital health technology-driven approaches to improve access to and promote engagement with and continuity of care during known periods of heightened risk, such as care transitions between systems (e.g., handoffs between emergency departments and inpatient psychiatric or substance abuse treatment; transitions between outpatient mental health/substance abuse programs and primary care settings).leverage patterns of use to identify subcategories of users (i.e., brief users, social users, persistent users) and develop and test strategies to encourage continued engagement.within digital health platforms that connect users with paraprofessionals and clinicians, test flexible patient matching algorithms and strategies to increase treatment fidelity to evidence based practices (ebps).test whether digital interventions can mitigate racial/ethnic/gender disparities in access, service utilization, and mental health outcomes.utilize electronic health record data in conjunction with digital health interventions to examine the clinical epidemiology, service utilization, response to treatment, within or across large systems responsible for mental health service delivery in order to inform timing and targets for intervening.areas of high program prioritydigital mental health interventions being tested should be based on existing social and behavioral science theories.interventions should take advantage of the unique functionality of mobile and wireless devices. utilization of real-time data collection and feedback is encouraged where appropriate.studies designed to test if the proposed digital mental health intervention yields significant reductions in symptoms in individuals who exhibit clinically significant symptoms and/or functional impairment at baseline.applications that propose digital mental health interventions that focus on treating serious mental illness (smi).studies that utilize software, devices, and systems that are interoperable with existing infrastructure such that resulting data is interoperable with relevant health information systems where applicable.applications that test generalizable principles or approaches to using technology to improve the accuracy and efficiency of assessment and the effectiveness and quality of intervention and service delivery.studies that address known challenges with uptake and adherence/sustained use of technology-based approaches and attention to privacy and other safety/ethical considerations associated with the use of technology for research and clinical purpose.applications not responsive to this foa:the following will be considered non-responsive for this announcement and will not be reviewed:applications that leverage digital mental health interventions that are not empirically based.testing of digital mental health interventions that do not focus on reducing the severity of clinically significant mental health symptoms and/or functional impairments.proposed studies that do not plan to enroll participants with baseline levels of measurable clinically significant symptoms and/or functional impairment.proposing the use of digital mental health platforms with insufficient users to conduct rapid, appropriately powered studies.applications that propose the translation of existing face-to-face treatments into digital health interventions.applications that propose clinical trials with a non-active comparator.scale and scope of studies covered under this announcement this foa encourages studies that utilize well-established digital mh platforms to conduct statistically powered trials testing strategies to optimize existing evidence-based digital health interventions. applicants pursuing other stages of research (e.g., intervention development, pilot testing, clinical trials outside of existing well-established platforms) are encouraged to visit the support for clinical trials at nimh webpage for a list of alternative foas for other stages of intervention development and testing. applicants are strongly encouraged to consult with nimh staff when developing plans for an application (see agency contacts, section vii). this early contact will provide an opportunity to clarify nimh policies and guidelines, and discuss whether the proposed project is consistent with nimh program priorities.the nimh has published updated policies and guidance for investigators regarding human research protection and clinical research data and safety monitoring (not-mh-19-027). the application’s phs human subjects and clinical trials information, including the data and safety monitoring plan, should reflect the policies and guidance in this notice. plans for the protection of research participants and

widespread data sharing among researchers, investigators funded under this foa are expected to share those data via the national institute of mental health data archive (nda; see not-mh-19-033). established by the nih, nda is a secure informatics platform for scientific collaboration and data-sharing that enables the effective communication of detailed research data, tools, and supporting documentation. nda links data across research projects through its global unique identifier (guid) and data dictionary technology. investigators funded under this foa are expected to use these technologies to submit data to nda.to accomplish this objective, it will be important to formulate a) an enrollment strategy that will obtain the information necessary to generate a guid for each participant, and b) a budget strategy that will cover the costs of data submission. the nda web site provides two tools to help investigators develop appropriate strategies: 1) the nda data submission cost model which offers a customizable excel worksheet that includes tasks and hours for the program director/principal investigator and data manager to budget for data sharing; and 2) plain language text to be considered in your informed consent available from the nda's data contribution page. investigators are expected to certify the quality of all data generated by grants funded under this foa prior to submission to nda and review their data for accuracy after submission. submission of descriptive/raw data is expected semi-annually (every january 15 and july 15); submission of all other data is expected at the time of publication, or prior to the end of the grant, whichever occurs first (see nda sharing regimen for more information); investigators are expected to share results, positive and negative, specific to the cohorts and outcome measures studied. the nda data sharing plan is available for review on the nda website. nda staff will work with investigators to help them submit data types not yet defined in the nda data dictionary.only limited appendix materials are allowed. follow all instructions for the appendix as described in the sf424 (r&r) application

the center for scientific review and responsiveness by components of participating organizations, nih. applications that are incomplete, non-compliant and/or nonresponsive will not be reviewed.use of common data elements in nih-funded researchmany nih ics encourage the use of common data elements (cdes) in basic, clinical, and applied research, patient registries, and other human subject research to facilitate broader and more effective use of data and advance research across studies. cdes are data elements that have been identified and defined for use in multiple data sets across different studies. use of cdes can facilitate data sharing and standardization to improve data quality and enable data integration from multiple studies and sources, including electronic health records. nih ics have identified cdes for many clinical domains (e.g., neurological disease), types of studies (e.g. genome-wide association studies (gwas)), types of outcomes (e.g., patient-reported outcomes), and patient registries (e.g., the global rare diseases patient registry and data repository). nih has established a “common data element (cde) resource portal" (http://cde.nih.gov/) to assist investigators in identifying nih-supported cdes when developing protocols, case report forms, and other instruments for data collection. the portal provides guidance about and access to nih-supported cde initiatives and other tools and resources for the appropriate use of cdes and data standards in nih-funded research. investigators are encouraged to consult the portal and describe in their applications any use they will make of nih-supported cdes in their projects.nimh has released expectations for collecting common data elements when an application involves human research participants. details can be found at not-mh-20-067 and the nimh webpage on data sharing for applicants and awardees.applicants are required to follow the instructions for post-submission materials, as described in the policy1. criteriaonly the review criteria described below will be considered in the review process. applications submitted to the nih in support of the nih mission are evaluated for scientific and technical merit through the nih peer review system.note: effective for due dates on or after january 25, 2023, the data sharing plan and genomic data sharing plan (gds) will not be evaluated at time of review.a proposed clinical trial application may include study design, methods, and intervention that are not by themselves innovative but address important questions or unmet needs. additionally, the results of the clinical trial may indicate that further clinical development of the intervention is unwarranted or lead to new avenues of scientific investigation.overall impactreviewers will provide an overall impact score to reflect their assessment of the likelihood for the project to exert a sustained, powerful influence on the research field(s) involved, in consideration of the
