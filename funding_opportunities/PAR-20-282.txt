purpose of this funding opportunity announcement (foa) is to support exploratory/developmental research that explores the premise that fertility status can be a marker for overall health. chronic conditions such as cancer, diabetes, and obesity can impair fertility; however, less is known about the extent to which fertility status can impact or act as a marker for overall health. data suggest that infertility is not necessarily a unique disease of the reproductive axis but is often physiologically or genetically linked with other diseases and conditions. recent epidemiologic studies demonstrate links between fertility status in both males and females and various somatic diseases and disorders. taken together, these data strongly suggest that fertility status can be a window into overall health. advancing this premise will require substantive involvement of experts in reproductive health/fertility along with expert in another non-reproductive specialty appropriate to the area of overall health being investigated, for example, experts in other fields such as epidemiology, or the somatic disease in question. this foa focuses on studies evaluating fertility as a marker for overall health, and therefore applications that look at the effects of a disease or disorder on fertility are outside of the scope of this program. recruitment of new cohorts will not be supported by

understanding the potential link(s) between fertility status and overall health. the reciprocal relationship between fertility status and overall health was a cross-cutting theme in the 2011 nichd white paper on reproduction (https://www.nichd.nih.gov/vision/pages/index.aspx), and the 2014 national public health action plan of the centers for disease control (cdc) stated that a clear need exists to identify public health priorities regarding infertility and its effect on health. in april 2016, the nichd and cdc sponsored “fertility status and overall health (fsoh)”, a workshop that brought together experts in cancer, cardiovascular disease, metabolic function, epidemiology, and reproductive health to obtain information about the current state of the science, including critical gaps in the link between fertility status and overall health, to identify the potential conceptual or technical barriers limiting progress in the field and what is needed to overcome them, and to determine the highest priorities to move the field forward.the concept of fertility as a window into overall health informed theme 2 of nichd’s strategic plan, “promoting gynecologic, andrologic and reproductive health”, and it addresses the cross-cutting theme of disease prevention. fertility status as a marker for overall health is a high program priority area for the fertility and infertility branch of nichd.this foa and the companion r01 foa promote the primary research goals identified in these sources. these foas focus on fertility as a marker for overall health, and therefore applications that look at the effects of a disease or disorder on fertility are outside of the scope of this program.purpose/research objectivesthe objective of the r21 support mechanism is to encourage new exploratory and developmental research projects. such projects are to assess the feasibility of a novel area of investigation or a new experimental system that has the potential to enhance health-related research, as well as the unique and innovative use of an existing methodology to explore a new scientific area. these studies may involve considerable risk but may lead to a breakthrough in a particular area, or to the development of novel techniques, agents, methodologies, models, or applications that could have a major impact on a field of biomedical, behavioral, or clinical research.the purpose of this foa is to support research that explores the premise that fertility status can be a marker for overall health. it is clear that chronic conditions such as cancer, diabetes, and obesity can impair fertility; however, less is known about the extent to which fertility status can impact or act as a marker for overall health. the purpose of this foa is to support research that explores the premise that fertility status can be a marker for overall health. it is clear that chronic conditions such as cancer, diabetes, and obesity can impair fertility, however less is known about the extent to which fertility status can impact or act as a marker for overall health.data suggest that infertility is not necessarily a unique disease of the reproductive axis, but is often physiologically or genetically linked with other diseases and conditions. recent epidemiologic studies demonstrate links between fertility status in both males and females and various somatic diseases and disorders. taken together, these data strongly suggest that fertility status can be a window into overall health. advancing this premise will require substantive involvement of experts in reproductive health/fertility status along with experts in another non-reproductive specialty appropriate to the area of overall health being investigated, for example, experts in other fields such as epidemiology, or the somatic disease in question.validation of this premise would strengthen the evidence base, thereby providing a valuable opportunity to affect future health during fertility evaluation, allowing early intervention in serious, chronic diseases. with an increase in the number of couples seeking infertility treatment, there is increased potential to reach people during reproductive years, when they are both highly motivated to protect their future health and young enough to harbor earlier, more responsive stages of disease.this foa encourages research to bolster evidence of fertility status as a marker for overall health in cases where the epidemiologic data is not already solid, and to explore the mechanistic links between fertility status and a later, known adverse health outcome. ultimately, such efforts could inform the counseling and interdisciplinary clinical care of infertility patients at higher risk for other diseases or disorders.applications to this foa must address fertility status as a marker for overall health; applications that assess the effects of somatic health on reproductive health or fertility status are out of scope of this foa and will be deemed low program priority.inclusion of minority and/or underserved populations is strongly encouraged. for studies using human subjects, existing cohorts must be used as recruitment of new cohorts will not be supported.specific areas of research interest for nichd: specific areas of research could include, but are not limited to, the following examples:specific areas of research interest for the nci: applications must focus on interests within the mission of nci. examples of areas of interest include but are not limited to:specific areas of research interest for niehs: research areas must focus on interests within the mission of niehs. examples include research on fertility status as a marker for health and disease such as metabolic diseases, cancers, cardiovascular disease, and other disease conditions.see section viii. other information for award authorities and regulations.grant: a support mechanism providing money, property,

also apply:nichd plans for sharing human and non-human data and/or biospecimensnichd expects that data, biospecimens, and results of nichd-funded research will be shared with the wider scientific community to the extent feasible and in a timely manner. nih data sharing policy expects the timely release and sharing of data to be no later than the acceptance for publication of the main findings from the final dataset.all nichd applications, regardless of the amount of direct costs requested for any one year, are expected to include a sharing plan that addresses sharing of data as well as biospecimens, if applicable. ideally, this plan would include submitting data or biospecimens to an appropriate repository. these plans will also be considered by program staff as award decisions are being made as appropriate and consistent with achieving the goals of the program.specifically, for human data, the nichd encourages the use of the data and specimen hub (dash), a centralized resource for researchers to store and access de-identified data from studies funded by nichd. they can also submit information about the location and availability of biospecimens to dash, if applicable. submission of data to the nichd dash is one way that grantees may meet the requirements of the nih data sharing policy and make study data available for secondary analyses. information about dash may be obtained at https://dash.nichd.nih.gov/if use of dash is not feasible, nichd expects awardees to share data and/or biospecimens through other equivalent broad-sharing data and/or biospecimen repositories. for projects generating large-scale human genetic data, applicants should provide a provisional or institutional certification specifying whether the individual-level data can be shared through an nih approved repository, such as dbgap, in line with the nih genomic data sharing policy (https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/not-od-14-124.html).only limited appendix

particular announcement, note the following:the r21 exploratory/developmental grant supports investigation of novel scientific ideas or new model systems, tools, or technologies that have the potential for significant impact on biomedical or biobehavioral research. an r21 grant application need not have extensive background material or preliminary information. accordingly, reviewers will emphasize the conceptual framework, the level of innovation, and the potential to significantly advance our knowledge or understanding. appropriate justification for the proposed work can be provided through literature citations, data from other sources, or, when available, from investigator-generated data. preliminary data are not required for r21 applications; however, they may be included if available.reviewers will provide an overall impact score to reflect their assessment of the likelihood for the project to exert a sustained, powerful influence on the research field(s) involved, in consideration of the following review criteria and additional review criteria (as applicable for the project proposed).reviewers will consider each of the review criteria below in the determination of scientific merit, and give a separate score for each. an application does not need to be strong in all categories to be judged likely to have major scientific impact. for example, a project that by its nature is not innovative may be essential to advance a field.significancedoes the project address an important problem or a critical barrier to progress in the field? is the prior research that serves as the key support for the proposed project rigorous? if the aims of the project are achieved, how will scientific knowledge, technical capability, and/or clinical practice be improved? how will successful completion of the aims change the concepts, methods, technologies, treatments, services, or preventative interventions that drive this field?to what extent does the application make the case, through literature citations and/or preliminary data, that reproductive health/fertility status could act as a marker for the given domain of somatic health? that is, is the reproductive health/fertility status condition likely to become apparent, clinically and/or to the patient, before the somatic disorder?investigator(s)are the pd(s)/pi(s), collaborators, and other researchers well suited to the project? if early stage investigators or those in the early stages of independent careers, do they have appropriate experience and training? if established, have they demonstrated an ongoing record of accomplishments that have advanced their field(s)? if the project is collaborative or multi-pd/pi, do the investigators have complementary and integrated expertise; are their leadership approach, governance and organizational structure appropriate for the project?is there substantive involvement of both a reproductive health/fertility status specialist along with an expert in another non-reproductive specialty appropriate to the area of overall health being investigated (for example, an epidemiologist, or an expert in the somatic disease in question)?innovationdoes the application challenge and seek to shift current research or clinical practice paradigms by utilizing novel theoretical concepts, approaches or methodologies, instrumentation, or interventions? are the concepts, approaches or methodologies, instrumentation, or interventions novel to one field of research or novel in a broad sense? is a refinement, improvement, or new application of theoretical concepts, approaches or methodologies, instrumentation, or interventions proposed?approachare the overall strategy, methodology, and analyses well-reasoned and appropriate to accomplish the specific aims of the project? have the investigators included plans to address weaknesses in the rigor of prior research that serves as the key support for the proposed project? have the investigators presented strategies to ensure a robust and unbiased approach, as appropriate for the work proposed? are potential problems, alternative strategies, and benchmarks for success presented? if the project is in the early stages of development, will the strategy establish feasibility and will particularly risky aspects be managed? have the investigators presented adequate plans to address relevant biological variables, such as sex, for studies in vertebrate animals or human subjects?specific for this foahow well does the stated approach test the premise that the reproductive condition becomes apparent clinically and/or to the patient before the somatic condition, either 1) through a direct test or 2) by presenting sound existing evidence of such a relationship? if using patient cohorts, are they currently existing, available for use in the proposed study, and well-suited for testing the hypothesis? if use of animal models is proposed, are they currently available or feasible to generate and test within the time-frame of the proposed study, and well-suited for testing the hypothesis?if the project involves human subjects and/or nih-defined clinical research, are the plans to address 1) the protection of human subjects from research risks, and 2) inclusion (or exclusion) of individuals on the basis of sex/gender, race, and ethnicity, as well as the inclusion or exclusion of individuals of all ages (including children and older adults), justified in terms of the scientific goals and research strategy proposed?environmentwill the scientific environment in which the work will be done contribute to the probability of success? are the institutional support, equipment and other physical resources available to the investigators adequate for the project proposed? will the project benefit from unique features of the scientific environment, subject populations, or collaborative arrangements?as applicable for the project proposed, reviewers will evaluate the following additional items while determining scientific and technical merit, and in providing an overall impact score, but will not give separate scores for these items.protections for human subjectsfor research that involves human subjects but does not involve one of the categories of research that are exempt under 45 cfr part 46, the committee will evaluate the justification for involvement of human subjects and the proposed protections from research risk relating to their participation according to the following five review criteria: 1) risk to subjects, 2) adequacy of protection against risks, 3) potential benefits to the subjects and others, 4) importance of the knowledge to be gained, and 5) data and safety monitoring for clinical trials.for research that involves human subjects and meets the criteria for one or more of the categories of research that are exempt under 45 cfr part 46, the committee will evaluate: 1) the justification for the exemption, 2) human subjects involvement and characteristics, and 3) sources of materials. for additional information on review of the human subjects section, please refer to the guidelines for the review of human subjects.inclusion of women, minorities, and individuals across the lifespanwhen the proposed project involves human subjects and/or nih-defined clinical research, the committee will evaluate the proposed plans for the inclusion (or exclusion) of individuals on the basis of sex/gender, race, and ethnicity, as well as the inclusion (or exclusion) of individuals of all ages (including children and older adults) to determine if it is justified in terms of the scientific goals and research strategy proposed. for additional information on review of the inclusion section, please refer to the guidelines for the review of inclusion in clinical research.vertebrate animalsthe committee will evaluate the involvement of live vertebrate animals as part of the scientific assessment according to the following criteria: (1) description of proposed procedures involving animals, including species, strains, ages, sex, and total number to be used; (2) justifications for the use of animals versus alternative models and for the appropriateness of the species proposed; (3) interventions to minimize discomfort, distress, pain and injury; and (4) justification for euthanasia method if not consistent with the avma guidelines for the euthanasia of animals. reviewers will assess the use of chimpanzees as they would any other application proposing the use of vertebrate animals. for additional information on review of the vertebrate animals section, please refer to the worksheet for review of the vertebrate animal section.biohazardsreviewers will assess whether materials or procedures proposed are potentially hazardous to research personnel and/or the environment, and if needed, determine whether adequate protection is proposed.resubmissionsfor resubmissions, the committee will evaluate the application as now presented, taking into consideration the responses to comments from the previous scientific review group and changes made to the project.renewalsnot applicablerevisionsfor revisions, the committee will consider the appropriateness of the proposed expansion of the scope of the project. if the revision application relates to a specific line of investigation presented in the original application that was not recommended for approval by the committee, then the committee will consider whether the responses to comments from the previous scientific review group are adequate and whether substantial changes are clearly evident.note: effective for due dates on or after january 25, 2023, the data sharing plan and genomic data sharing plan
