gender minority populations, socioeconomically disadvantaged populations, and underserved rural populations, continue to experience a disproportionate burden of disease and risk factors, unmet health care needs and other adverse health conditions.as the nation’s steward of biomedical and behavioral research, nih has devoted considerable resources to characterize the root causes of health disparities, uncovering a complex web of interconnected and overlapping factors (i.e., biological, behavioral, environmental, and societal). as an important next step, research is needed that capitalizes upon knowledge about causal pathways to directly and demonstrably contribute to the reduction of health disparities. of importance is research that moves beyond an exclusive focus on the health status of individuals to examine and address how larger systemic factors cause, sustain, or minimize health disparities in communities, regions, and the nation as a whole. disparities in health care are a clear contributor to disparities in health outcomes. differences in health care utilization patterns and quality of care indicators between populations affected by health disparities and the general population have been well documented. more work is needed to understand how best to eliminate these inequities by understanding the causal mechanisms and evaluating the effectiveness of interventions. in addition, with the emerging coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) pandemic, differences in health care utilization patterns and quality of care need to be reevaluated and interventions to reduce health disparities generated by this pandemic and improve minority health need to be developed and evaluated.the purpose of this foa is to encourage health services research that can directly contribute to the improvement of minority health and/or the reduction of health disparities, while taking into consideration the interaction between system-level healthcare, individual clinical care and social determinants of health, including the role of structural systemic factors, place and neighborhood factors. the focus of this foa is on all services provided in the healthcare setting where individuals from health disparity populations seek care with a clinician for preventive services, chronic disease management, urgent symptomatic care, emergency care, and hospital care. these health services do include tele-medicine or virtual or remote encounters and home visits.research objectivesthe overarching purpose of this foa is to promote research to generate new knowledge to improve health care access, delivery, utilization and quality, and health outcomes of racial and ethnic minority populations and other groups affected by health disparities. research encouraged under this foa includes the examination of population-specific clinical presentation and/or manifestation of diseases and their complications within the context of health care settings; services within health care systems and non-clinical settings linked to health care systems (e.g. personal residences, school-based health centers, the workplace, and criminal justice settings); etiologies and reduction of health care disparities; structure and organization of health care systems and coordination of health care; impact of healthcare and non-healthcare policies on health care and health disparities; and system-wide interventions or multi-level interventions. projects may address health services pertaining to health promotion, screening for disease or risk factors, prevention at any level, diagnosis and the treatment of particular health conditions (including chronic diseases, mental and substance abuse disorders, and infectious diseases such the 2019 novel coronavirus), specific segments of populations affected by health disparities (e.g. pregnant women, children, persons with disabilities, older adults), or more general indicators (e.g., access to primary care services or specialty care) that may not be condition-specific. projects may include observational/descriptive, or interventional studies (including randomized clinical trials, pragmatic trials and others) and may involve primary data collection and/or secondary analysis of existing datasets. projects should involve the use of relevant health system-level data in some way. projects should include a focus on one or more nih-designated us populations affected by health disparities, which include blacks/african americans, hispanics/latinos, american indians/alaska natives, asian americans, native hawaiians and other pacific islanders, socioeconomically disadvantaged populations, underserved rural populations, and sexual and gender minorities. projects that include populations that identify across more than one health disparity group are encouraged.applications not responsive to the foathe primary interest of this foa is research on system-wide health services research that encompasses the diversity of individuals served within these health care systems. it is expected that projects will include patient or participant samples that are representative of the population served by the health care system(s) to be studied. examples of projects that will not be considered responsive to this foa include:note: non-responsive applications will not be reviewed. applicants are encouraged to reach out to scientific contacts for this foa to discuss responsiveness.research methodologyexamples of research methods could include, but are not limited to:areas of research interestresearch topics of interest include but are not limited to:specific areas of research interest for niaaa:specific areas of research interest for odp:the office of disease prevention (odp) serves as the liaison office for the nih to the uspstf. as such, the odp encourages trans-nih collaborations to address prevention research gaps. for example, the u.s. preventive services task force has recommended lung cancer screening with low radiation dose ct (ldct) for adults at increased risk since 2013. but uptake of this recommended preventive service in the population eligible for screening is very low. an estimated 136,000 people are expected to die of lung cancer disease in 2020, and the burden of lung cancer is higher in african americans, in members of other minority groups, and in adults ages 65 and older. thus, the nih odp is interested in implementation research studies that identify effective ways to increase discussions about and encourage appropriate use of ldct screening among nih-designated u.s. health disparity populations affected by health disparities, especially african american (see https://www.nimhd.nih.gov/about/overview/ for more information about nih-designated u.s. disparity populations).one of the office of disease prevention’s strategic priority areas is to promote the best available methods in prevention research. the odp encourages applications using interventions or observational research designs that have strong implications for disease prevention and make use of innovative design, measurement, and analytic methods. in the context of this foa, examples of research areas of interest include, but are not limited to:design, analysis, and sample size considerations for studies to evaluate interventions:investigators seeking to evaluate the effect of an intervention on a health-related biomedical or behavioral outcome may propose a study design in which (1) groups or clusters are assigned to study arms and individual observations are analyzed to evaluate the effect of the intervention, or (2) participants are assigned individually to study arms but receive at least some of their intervention in a group format or through a shared facilitator. designs that might be proposed include parallel group- or cluster-randomized trials, stepped-wedge group- or cluster- randomized trials, individually randomized group-treatment trials, multiple baseline designs, time-series designs, and other quasi-experimental designs. whenever participants are assigned in groups or clusters (e.g., families, clinics, schools, worksites, communities), or participants receive some part of their intervention in a group format or through a shared facilitator, and observations on individual participants are analyzed for between-group effects, special methods are required for analysis and sample size. applicants will need to show that their methods are appropriate given their plans for assignment of participants and delivery of interventions. additional information is available at https://researchmethodsresources.nih.gov/.applications must also be relevant to the objectives of at least one of the participating nih institutes and centers (ic) listed above. odp does not award grants. please contact the relevant ic program contact listed for questions related to ic research priorities and funding.the mission of the national eye institute (www.nei.nih.gov) is to eliminate vision loss and improve quality of life through vision research. the nei supports basic and clinical research into diseases and disorders of the visual system and the special needs of people with impaired vision or who are blind. nei is particularly interested in eye- and vision-related health services research that can directly contribute to the improvement of minority health and the reduction of health disparities. this includes studies of strategies to improve health care access, delivery, utilization and quality, and health outcomes of people who are visually impaired or blind.the national eye institute will not support clinical trials that are greater than minimal risk on this funding opportunity. minimal risk is defined as the probability and magnitude of harm or discomfort anticipated in the research are not greater in and of themselves than those ordinarily encountered in daily life or during the performance of routine physical or psychological examinations or tests.see section viii. other information for award authorities and regulations.grant: a support mechanism providing money, property, or both to an eligible

https://www.hhs.gov/civil-rights/for-providers/provider-obligations/index.html and http://www.hhs.gov/ocr/civilrights/understanding/section1557/index.html.hhs recognizes that research projects are often limited in scope for many reasons that are nondiscriminatory, such as the principal investigator’s scientific interest, funding limitations, recruitment requirements, and other considerations. thus, criteria in research protocols that target or exclude certain populations are warranted where nondiscriminatory justifications establish that such criteria are appropriate with respect to the health or safety of the subjects, the scientific study design, or the purpose of the research. for additional guidance regarding how the provisions apply to nih grant programs, please contact the
