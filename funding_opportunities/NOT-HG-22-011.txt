phs 2021-2 omnibus solicitation of the nih for small business technology transfer grant applications (parent sttr [r41/r42] clinical trial required)national human genome research institute (nhgri)purpose:the national human genome research institute (nhgri) is issuing a notice of special interest (nosi) to encourage applications to develop and implement patient-facing genomic-based clinical informatics tools that facilitate or enhance patient-provider electronic communication, patient tracking and registry functions, patient self-management and support, provider electronic prescribing, test tracking, referral tracking, and health care decision-making.background:a critical gap in genomic medicine is the availability of clinical informatics tools that employ computational and electronic approaches to facilitate patient understanding of genomic information and assist in using that information for health care decisions. recognizing this gap, nhgri is interested in receiving applications that propose the development and implementation of patient-facing clinical informatics tools that incorporate genomic information. applicants should describe how their proposed tool(s) will: 1) adapt to healthcare systems varying in size and resources, 2) be useable by a clinically and socio-demographically diverse array of patients, 3) present genomic information in a customizable and patient-friendly manner, 4) improve providersâ€™ ability to engage in shared decision-making with patients about care and treatment, and 5) address barriers that limit the development and implementation of genomic information in patient care. applications should also include plans for using the latest evidence-based recommendations and guidelines across relevant fields (e.g., genomic science, health service delivery, patient education, informatics). areas of interest include but are not limited to genomic based computational and electronic tools that allow patients to:applications should describe how approaches will mitigate bias, health disparities, and other factors that threaten the meaningful, equitable, and beneficial use of genomics in patient care. these factors may be tied to the availability, accessibility, quality, use and/or interpretation of data and clinical algorithms, information systems, and health care providers and services. applications should also describe how they will involve and integrate feedback from future users.application and submission informationthis notice applies to due dates on or after february 10, 2022 and subsequent receipt dates through september 24, 2025.applications submitted in response to this nosi must reference one of the following funding opportunities announcements or any reissues of the following announcements through the expiration date of this notice:pa-20-183 -
