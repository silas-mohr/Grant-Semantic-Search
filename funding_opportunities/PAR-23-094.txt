(foa) is to encourage research applications to develop and test the effectiveness and implementation of family navigator models designed to promote early access, engagement, coordination and optimization of mental health treatment and services for children and adolescents who are experiencing early symptoms of mental health problems. for the purposes of this foa, nimh defines a family navigator model as a health care professional or paraprofessional whose role is to deploy a set of strategies designed to rapidly engage youth and families in needed treatment and services, work closely with the family and other involved treatment and service providers to optimize care, and through the use of technology – to monitor the trajectory of mental health symptoms and outcomes over time. applicants are required to develop and test the navigator model’s ability to promote early access, engagement, coordination and optimization of mental health treatment and services for children and adolescents as soon as symptoms are detected. applicants are also required to identify and test components of navigator models that drive improvements in mental health care; detect and interrogate tailoring variables that optimize the ‘personalized match’ between the unique mental health needs of youth to the appropriate level of intensity and frequency of mental health services; and utilize emerging novel technologies to track and monitor the trajectory of clinical, functional and behavioral progress toward achieving intended services outcomes.this foa is published in parallel to a companion r34 foa, par-21-292 supporting pilot studies in preparation for the larger-scale studies described here.30 days prior to the application due dateall applications are due by 5:00 pm local

outcomes.backgroundthe onset of mental illnesses frequently occurs during childhood or adolescence. national data indicate that nearly half (45%) of youth ages 4-17 with serious emotional and behavioral difficulties do not receive mental health treatment. among children and adolescents with emotional and behavioral difficulties that do not meet diagnostic threshold criteria, parents reported that 80% do not receive needed mental health treatment. studies suggest that early mental illness symptoms reported in late childhood and early adolescence – if left untreated – are likely to develop into psychological disorders with long-lasting effects well into adulthood.traditional mental health services and coordinated care for youth have historically been provided at later time points, often after symptoms have worsened and have caused significant impairment and distress for youth and family members. families attempting to negotiate complex health care referral processes often encounter difficulties accessing and receiving needed mental health services (e.g., youth experiencing symptoms of anxiety, depression or suicidal ideation, yet are not deemed to be at sufficient risk for psychiatric treatment or hospitalization). in addition, many youth who experience these problems represent underserved populations and thus, are less likely to access or receive needed mental health treatment and services.research findings suggest that early intervention programs, similar to the coordinated specialty care model tested in the recovery after an initial schizophrenia episode (raise) research project, are effective at interrupting the developmental trajectory of mental illnesses and improving clinical and functional outcomes for children and adolescents. in related areas such as autism spectrum disorder, recent research suggests that early detection and referral to services lead to improved outcomes among young children. several studies testing early intervention programs have reported that variations on the use and type of navigator models across a number of health care fields (e.g., cancer, substance abuse, cardiovascular care) have been found to be effective.the mental health field has initiated the use of navigator models – primarily with adults across a variety of settings. in one model, the navigator serves as the primary mental health clinician and provides care coordination activities for adults with serious mental illness. another model utilizes a navigator who is a health care professional with mental health expertise (e.g., care coordinator, case manager) who coordinates the needed care but does not provide the primary mental health treatment. a third navigator model consists of peer-professionals teaching health care self-management to adults, providing treatment monitoring and encouraging follow-up with needed services.nimh is interested in testing the effectiveness and implementation of a navigator model when delivered to children and adolescents as soon as symptoms are detected. important knowledge gaps include understanding the key components of navigator models that:increase our understanding of navigator components that drive improvements in mental health care;identify and test tailoring variables that optimize the ‘personalized match’ between the level of need and available mental health services;employ innovative technologies (e.g., dashboards, digital tools, real-time analytics) to enhance engagement, monitor symptoms, match youth need to available mental health resources and evaluate treatment progress;identify opportunities to reduce disparities in mental health access and outcomes among underserved populations;enhance access, engagement, coordination and optimization of needed mental health services; andimprove clinical, functional and behavioral outcomes for children and adolescents.research objectivesthe goal of this initiative is to develop and test navigator models that promote early access, engagement, coordination and optimization of mental health treatment and services for children and adolescents who are experiencing early symptoms of mental health problems. this initiative aims to test navigator models that: (1) identify and test components of family navigator models that drive clinical improvements in mental health care; (2) detect and interrogate tailoring variables that optimize the ‘personalized match’ between the unique mental health needs of youth to the appropriate level of intensity and frequency of mental health services; (3) utilize emerging novel technologies to track and monitor the trajectory of clinical, functional and behavioral progress toward achieving intended services outcomes; (4) rapidly engage and work closely with youth and family members over an extended period of time to ensure that therapeutic gains (e.g., reduction in symptoms, improved family, peer and school functioning and improved behavioral outcomes) are maintained and sustained; and (5) increase our understanding about how navigator models reduce health disparities.this foa is intended to support applications that test personalized navigation approaches that deliver the appropriate amount, intensity and frequency of needed treatment and services as symptoms wax and wane over time. nimh requires applications to utilize innovative technology (e.g., dashboards, therapeutic milestone measurement, mobile assessment, sensory processing, digital tools, real-time analytics) to assist navigators in engaging, facilitating and optimizing personalized mental health care for each child and adolescent. when possible, applications should incorporate health information technology (hit) and embed technologies in electronic health records (ehr) to coordinate care across delivery settings and enhance sustainability.navigator models to be tested may include but are not limited to the following: (a) mental health clinicians who provide evidence-based treatment directly to the youth and family and also serve as family navigators by monitoring coordinated care and communication with the other involved treatment and service providers; (b) health care professionals with mental health expertise (e.g., nurses, social workers, counselors) who are not responsible for providing the primary mental health treatment, yet serve as family navigators; or (c) paraprofessionals trained in mental health education and in the application of proven engagement approaches (e.g., motivational interviewing) who serve as family navigators. each model will develop and test a set of strategies deployed by the navigator designed to promote early access, engagement, coordination and optimization of mental health treatment and services.navigator model settings may be located in mental health clinics, public health agencies (e.g., child welfare and juvenile justice), schools, primary care or other settings. navigators should work closely and be integrated with other treatment and service providers to facilitate and monitor routine communication to the treatment providers, youth, and family members. it is anticipated that referrals to a navigator may occur through a range of referral sources (e.g., caregiver, teacher, healthcare provider), depending on the navigator model, and can occur before a formal mental health assessment or screening takes place. navigator functions should include the following components: (a) reducing systemic barriers to care (e.g., coordination of screening, diagnosis and ongoing care from a range of treatment providers); (b) delivering mental health information, education, and psychosocial support to caregivers and youth; (c) utilizing engagement strategies to increase treatment adherence; (d) utilizing novel and emerging technological approaches (e.g., mobile assessment, sensory processing, digital tools, real-time analytics) to match the unique mental health needs of youth to community resources and/or telehealth services; and (e) problem-solving challenges in accessing mental health resources (e.g., healthcare coverage, telehealth services, transportation, childcare).a variety of rigorous methodological approaches are possible for testing the impact of the proposed navigator model. these approaches may include randomized controlled trials, quasi-experimental designs with non-randomized comparison groups, time series designs, and other designs of equivalent rigor and relevance. nimh strongly encourages the utilization of optimization research designs such as sequential multiple assignment randomized trial (smart) adaptive designs or multiphase optimization strategy (most) factorial designs to identify and test components of navigator models that drive improvements in care. considerations for selecting a research design for the proposed study include the scientific question that the study is designed to answer, practical constraints, ethical issues, and the tradeoff between maximizing internal and external validity.navigator training needs will vary among different models and applicants are required to provide a description of the training required for the proposed model. for example, when the navigator is a mental health professional, training may focus more on care coordination, availability of local resources and utilization of novel technologies, while navigators who are paraprofessionals may need supplemental training on mental health symptoms and treatment, family dynamics and the principles of engagement. all models should consider the need for ongoing supervision of or consultation with the navigator to achieve fidelity and sustainability of the model. applicants are also encouraged to provide justification of both the likelihood of achieving the intended outcomes and the potential for broad uptake and implementation, should a tested model prove to be effective.responsive areas of researchconsistent with the nimh experimental therapeutics approach, applications are required to provide a strong theoretical rationale for the selected targets or mechanisms of action hypothesized to lead to the intended outcomes of the proposed navigator model, measure whether those targets are engaged during the navigator intervention delivery, and design the study to test whether target engagement mediates the outcome of the navigator intervention (see support for clinical trials at nimh). active elements of the model might occur at the navigator, treatment team (involved treatment and service providers), supervisor, interagency and/or community level, and appropriate studies should clearly describe and include such factors in the conceptualization of the intervention and in the design of the study. for more information about measurement of target engagement, see par-21-130, "clinical trials to test the effectiveness of treatment, preventive, and services interventions (r01)".applicants are required to propose a navigator model that:identifies factors that facilitate sustainability (e.g., utilization of existing navigator programs, shared public and private funding, enhanced economic strategies), scalability and generalizability to other settings;utilizes innovative technology (e.g., dashboards, therapeutic milestone measurement, mobile assessment, sensory processing, digital tools, real-time analytics) to assist navigators in engaging, facilitating and optimizing personalized mental health care for each child and adolescent.nimh anticipates that studies funded by this foa will substantially contribute to the development of the following:a body of generalizable knowledge regarding effective mental health navigation models;identification of a set of research-informed strategies to improve care coordination;enhance our understanding of the impact of navigator models on reducing mental health disparities among underserved populations.this foa is intended to support studies that are statistically powered to provide a definitive test of the navigator model’s effectiveness in comparison to usual care practices or alternative intervention/services approaches. support for pilot studies to promote the development of and evaluate the initial feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary effectiveness of navigator models is provided via foa par-21-292, "pilot studies to test the initiation of a mental health family navigator model to promote early access, engagement, coordination and optimization of needed mental health services for children and adolescents (r34)".applications not responsive to this foaapplications proposing the following will be considered non-responsive to this foa and will not be reviewed:applications that propose to test the effectiveness of traditional therapeutic or preventive interventions, rather than testing navigator models that aim to identify components to improve access, engagement, coordination and optimization of services;studies that propose testing task-shifting or other approaches to deliver traditional therapeutic or preventive interventions by paraprofessionals or other non-traditional therapists – without testing navigator components to improve care;studies that do not propose testing emerging technologies to assist navigators to optimize the ‘personalized match’ between the unique mental health needs of youth to the appropriate level of intensity and frequency of mental health services.potential applicants are strongly encouraged to contact scientific/research contacts as far in advance as possible to discuss the match between potential research applications and current nimh priorities.nimh is committed to supporting research that reduces disparities and advances equity in mental health interventions, services, and outcomes. accordingly, this foa encourages research to identify opportunities to reduce disparities in access, engagement, coordination and optimization of mental health treatment and services among youth from racial and ethnic minority groups, sexual and gender minority groups, or other underserved groups including individuals limited by language or cultural barriers, individuals living in rural areas, or socioeconomically disadvantaged persons.protections for human subjects: applications with data collection plans that involve multiple respondent groups (e.g., clients/patients, therapists/providers, supervisors, administrators) should address provisions for human subject protections and consenting procedures for all participant groups, accordingly. the nimh has published updated policies and guidance for investigators regarding human research protection and clinical research data and safety monitoring (not-mh-19-027). the application’s protection of human subjects section plans should reflect the policies and guidance in this notice. plans for the protection of research subjects and data and safety monitoring will be reviewed by the nimh for consistency with nimh and nih policies and federal regulations.see section viii. other information for award authorities and regulations.investigators proposing nih-defined

advance the goal of advancing research through widespread data sharing among researchers, investigators funded under this foa are expected to share those data via the national institute of mental health data archive (nda; see not-mh-19-033). established by the nih, nda is a secure informatics platform for scientific collaboration and data-sharing that enables the effective communication of detailed research data, tools, and supporting documentation. nda links data across research projects through its global unique identifier (guid) and data dictionary technology. investigators funded under this foa are expected to use these technologies to submit data to nda.to accomplish this objective, it will be important to formulate a) an enrollment strategy that will obtain the information necessary to generate a guid for each participant, and b) a budget strategy that will cover the costs of data submission. the nda web site provides two tools to help investigators develop appropriate strategies: 1) the nda data submission cost model which offers a customizable excel worksheet that includes tasks and hours for the program director/principal investigator and data manager to budget for data sharing; and 2) plain language text to be considered in your informed consent available from the nda's data contribution page. investigators are expected to certify the quality of all data generated by grants funded under this foa prior to submission to nda and review their data for accuracy after submission. submission of descriptive/raw data is expected semi-annually (every january 15 and july 15); submission of all other data is expected at the time of publication, or prior to the end of the grant, whichever occurs first (see nda sharing regimen for more information); investigators are expected to share results, positive and negative, specific to the cohorts and outcome measures studied. the nda data sharing plan is available for review on the nda website. nda staff will work with investigators to help them submit data types not yet defined in the nda data dictionary.only limited appendix materials are allowed. follow all instructions for the appendix as

application instructions by the center for scientific review and responsiveness by components of participating organizations, nih. applications that are incomplete, non-compliant and/or nonresponsive will not be reviewed.use of common data elements in nih-funded researchmany nih ics encourage the use of common data elements (cdes) in basic, clinical, and applied research, patient registries, and other human subject research to facilitate broader and more effective use of data and advance research across studies. cdes are data elements that have been identified and defined for use in multiple data sets across different studies. use of cdes can facilitate data sharing and standardization to improve data quality and enable data integration from multiple studies and sources, including electronic health records. nih ics have identified cdes for many clinical domains (e.g., neurological disease), types of studies (e.g. genome-wide association studies (gwas)), types of outcomes (e.g., patient-reported outcomes), and patient registries (e.g., the global rare diseases patient registry and data repository). nih has established a “common data element (cde) resource portal" (http://cde.nih.gov/) to assist investigators in identifying nih-supported cdes when developing protocols, case report forms, and other instruments for data collection. the portal provides guidance about and access to nih-supported cde initiatives and other tools and resources for the appropriate use of cdes and data standards in nih-funded research. investigators are encouraged to consult the portal and describe in their applications any use they will make of nih-supported cdes in their projects.nimh has released expectations for collecting common data elements when an application involves human research participants. details can be found at not-mh-20-067 and the nimh webpage on data sharing for applicants and awardees.applicants are required to follow the instructions for post-submission materials, as described in the policy1. criteriaonly the review criteria described below will be considered in the review process. applications submitted to the nih in support of the nih mission are evaluated for scientific and technical merit through the nih peer review system.note: effective for due dates on or after january 25, 2023, the data sharing plan and genomic data sharing plan (gds) will not be evaluated at time of review.a proposed clinical trial application may include study design, methods, and intervention that are not by themselves innovative but address important questions or unmet needs. additionally, the results of the clinical trial may indicate that further clinical development of the intervention is unwarranted or lead to new avenues of scientific investigation.overall impactreviewers will provide an overall impact score to reflect their assessment of the likelihood for the project to exert a sustained, powerful influence on the
