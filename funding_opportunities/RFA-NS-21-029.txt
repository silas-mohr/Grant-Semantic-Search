sickle-cell pain, cancer pain, visceral pain, post stroke pain, myofascial pain, painful disorders of the orofacial region and other conditions will be considered. projects to develop analgesics for a combination of chronic overlapping pain conditions or for specific disease or pathological conditions will also be considered. we encourage projects that seek to identify novel targets in specific populations, including women, children, older adults and other underrepresented groups. the goal of the 2-year application should be to develop a strong biological rationale, establish a research team, and collect preliminary data that will be used to submit a therapeutics development plan under the companion u19 funding mechanism, rfa-ns-21-015.backgroundthe nih heal initiative:this study is part of the nih’s helping to end addiction long-term (heal) initiative to speed scientific solutions to the national opioid public health crisis. the nih heal initiative bolsters research across nih to (1) improve treatment for opioid misuse and addiction and (2) enhance pain management. more information about the heal initiative is available at: https://heal.nih.gov/.more than 25 million americans suffer from daily chronic pain, a highly debilitating medical condition that is complex and difficult to manage. in recent decades, there has been an overreliance on the prescription of opioids for chronic pain despite their poor ability to improve function and high addiction liability. this contributed to a significant and alarming epidemic of opioid addiction, overdose, and death. thus, there is a critical need for innovative scientific solutions to develop alternative pain treatment options.through targeted research efforts, the nih heal initiative proposes to accelerate the discovery and preclinical development of new medications to treat pain. this funding opportunity announcement (foa) is part of a suite of foas to support the development of safe and effective therapeutics to treat pain with little or no addiction liability.the following is a list of these coordinated funding announcements:rfa-ns-21-029 will support planning projects that are designed to support building a strong research team, develop feasibility, validity, or other technically qualifying results that support, enable, and/or lay the groundwork for a subsequent u19 application, rfa-ns-21-015.rfa-ns-21-015 will support team-based research projects that develop assays, screen and propose early optimization work to develop a non-addictive therapeutic to treat pain. discovery and/or validation of pharmacodynamic markers and efficacy and pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (pk/pd) studies are responsive to rfa-ns-21-015.applications to rfa-ns-21-010 require a promising small molecule or biologic hit or lead for optimization, a rigorous biological rationale for the intended approach, and scientifically sound assays for testing the optimization of the hit or lead. in addition, a strong package of data linking the putative therapeutic target to the proposed disease indication and supporting the hypothesis that altering the target activity will produce desirable outcomes for the pain type is required.the goal of this foa (rfa-ns-21-029) is to establish feasibility, validity, or other technically qualifying preliminary data that will support, enable, and/or lay the groundwork for a subsequent team research u19. at the conclusion of this 2-year award, applicants are expected to produce sufficient preliminary data and evidence of a strong interdisciplinary research team with sufficient translational expertise to prepare a competitive application for rfa-ns-21-015 heal initiative: analgesic development initial translational efforts [small molecules and biologics] (u19 clinical trial not allowed). there is no opportunity for renewal of this award.research objectivesapplications deemed to be non-responsive will not proceed to review. studies that are

(gds) as part of the resource sharing plan will not be evaluated at time of review.only the review criteria described below will be considered in the review process. applications submitted to the nih in support of the nih mission are evaluated for scientific and technical merit through the nih peer review system.for this particular announcement, note the following:the heal initiative invites applications with high levels of innovation, which assumes some degree of risk. although reviewers will consider feasibility, they will be instructed to not penalize unavoidable risks that are intrinsic to new and innovative approaches.this r61 will support exploratory research that establishes feasibility, validity or other technically qualifying results of a novel or existing pain therapeutic concept with little to no abuse liability that, if successful, would support, enable, and/or lay the groundwork for further validation and early therapeutic development as part of a team research u19. reviewers should evaluate whether projects are supported by a sound biological rationale and provide evidence to characterize the relevance of the identified pain target for subsequent pain therapy development if this planning project is successful.of equal importance, reviewers should evaluate the team development plan to determine whether applicants include a strong proposal to recruit scientific experts with a diverse set of skills that can develop a viable pain target for further therapeutics development. preliminary data are not required; however, they may be included if available. this rfa is not intended to support further optimization of an established therapeutic. rather, the goal of this foa is to support initial team planning and preliminary data generation to support a subsequent submission of a therapeutics development plan to the companion team research u19.reviewers will provide an overall impact score to reflect their assessment of the likelihood for the project to develop a research team and the preliminary data needed to support a subsequent submission of a therapeutics development plan to the companion foa u19 rfa-ns-21-015. in addition, reviewers should consider the potential for the project to exert a sustained, powerful influence on pain therapeutics development, in consideration of the following review criteria and additional review criteria (as applicable for the project proposed).reviewers will consider each of the review criteria below in the determination of scientific merit, and give a separate score for each. an application does not need to be strong in all categories to be judged likely to have major scientific impact. for example, a project that by its nature is not innovative may be essential to advance a field.does the project address an important problem or a critical barrier to progress in the field? is the prior research that serves as the key support for the proposed project rigorous? if the aims of the project are achieved, how will scientific knowledge, technical capability, and/or clinical practice be improved? how will successful completion of the aims change the concepts, methods, technologies, treatments, services, or preventative interventions that drive this field?are the pd(s)/pi(s), collaborators, and other researchers well suited to the project? if early stage investigators or those in the early stages of independent careers, do they have appropriate experience and training? if established, have they demonstrated an ongoing record of accomplishments that

experimental design, and rigor.• assay development and drug discovery (such as assay development, screening, pharmacology, medicinal chemistry).• early drug development (such as pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, biomarkers, and in vitro adme (absorption, disposition, metabolism, excretion).• in addition, the team should include those who can help the team plan for future therapy development beyond this rfa (such as later stage drug development experts, regulatory experts, clinicians).• are the team management plans clear and appropriate?team director: has the proposed team director demonstrated extensive knowledge, experience and leadership in the area of pain therapeutic discovery and development, with a strong record of scientific achievements? has the proposed team director demonstrated her/his ability to organize, direct, and administer a complex research and therapeutic development program?individual team/group leaders: have the leaders on the individual team/group demonstrated knowledge, experience and leadership in the proposed research component? are there prior demonstrations of collaborative teamwork?• is there evidence that the research team has been/will be able to work together effectively to accomplish the research proposed in the projects?does the application challenge and seek to shift current research or clinical practice paradigms by utilizing novel theoretical concepts, approaches or methodologies, instrumentation, or interventions? are the concepts, approaches or methodologies, instrumentation, or interventions novel to one field of research or novel in a broad sense? is a refinement, improvement, or new application of theoretical concepts, approaches or methodologies, instrumentation, or interventions proposed?are the overall strategy, methodology, and analyses well-reasoned and appropriate to accomplish the specific aims of the project? have the investigators included plans to address weaknesses in the rigor of prior research that serves as the key support for the proposed project? have the investigators presented strategies to ensure a robust and unbiased approach, as appropriate for the work proposed? are potential problems, alternative strategies, and benchmarks for success presented? if the project is in the early stages of development, will the strategy establish feasibility and will particularly risky aspects be managed? have the investigators presented adequate plans to address relevant biological variables, such as sex, for studies in vertebrate animals or human subjects?if the project involves human subjects and/or nih-defined clinical research, are the plans to address 1) the protection of human subjects from research risks, and 2) inclusion (or exclusion) of individuals on the basis of sex/gender, race, and ethnicity, as well as the inclusion or exclusion of individuals of all ages (including children and older adults), justified in terms of the scientific goals and research strategy proposed?how well does the data sharing plan conform to the the heal data sharing requirments such as providinga summary of the data to be shared, a description fo the data reporting standards, a plan for the data archiving, and a timeline for data submission to an archive and sharing data with the research community?will the scientific environment in which the work will be done contribute to the probability of success? are the institutional support, equipment and other physical resources available to the investigators adequate for the project proposed? will the project benefit from unique features of the scientific environment, subject populations, or collaborative arrangements?as applicable for the project proposed, reviewers will evaluate the following additional items while determining scientific and technical merit, and in providing an overall impact score, but will not give separate scores for these items.protections for human subjectsfor research that involves human subjects but does not involve one of the categories of research that are exempt under 45 cfr part 46, the committee will evaluate the justification for involvement of human subjects and
