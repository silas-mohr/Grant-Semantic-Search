march 2, 2022pa-20-272 - administrative supplements to existing nih grants and cooperative agreements (parent admin supp clinical trial optional)national institute of allergy and infectious diseases (niaid)the niaid is inviting administrative supplement applications from current niaid awardees that are not currently focused on the research and early development of medical countermeasures (mcms) against chemical threats to allow them to expand their mcm research focus into this critical field. there must be sufficient progress on the parent project to justify the additional supplemental work. the proposed supplemental activities must be within the scope of the approved aims of the parent award.scope of interestthe chemical countermeasures research program (ccrp) was established in 2006 by the niaid to promote the discovery and advancements of mcms to treat and/or prevent serious morbidities and mortality during or after mass casualty, high consequence, public health events involving the release of highly toxic chemicals. in support of these goals, the ccrp seeks to promote basic research to identify mechanisms of toxic effects and application of the fundamental knowledge gained to support the discovery and early-stage development of mcms. to learn more, see the national institutes of health chemical countermeasures research program (nih ccrp): a collaborative opportunity to develop effective and accessible chemical medical countermeasures for the american people, published in drug development research.the research scope of the ccrp is the discovery and efficacy validation of post-exposure mcms and includes: 1) treating the acute and chronic health effects of chemical threats; 2) easy administration in a mass-casualty situation; and 3) rapidly effective as delayed therapies (treatment window typically â‰¥ 30 minutes after exposure). for this notice of special interest, the post-exposure treatment window may be reduced to obtain initial proof-of-principle pilot efficacy data for use as preliminary results in subsequent ccrp application submissions for more extensive grant support where utility within a civilian-based mass casualty therapeutic window may then be explored.injuries caused by acute exposure to chemicals often manifest similarly or identical to conditions observed in clinical practice such as acute lung injury, acute respiratory distress syndrome, coagulopathy, tissue fibrosis, keratopathy, neovascularization, seizure, neurodegeneration, and respiratory depression, so proposals that contemplate expansion of indications of already approved/authorized therapeutics and/or those still in the exploratory or validation stage for illness, infection, disease, radiation, etc. related physiopathology are highly encouraged.examples of clinical indication(s) and chemical agents of interest include, but are not limited to:there are other chemicals of interest in addition to those listed above (and acceptable surrogates for use in traditional academic settings to establish initial proof-of-principle). applicants are strongly encouraged to contact and discuss their proposed research/aims with the program official named in their current notice of grant award and the ccrp scientific /program contact listed below well in advance of the receipt deadline to determine responsiveness, programmatic interest, and relevance.only projects that include chemicals (or acceptable surrogates) that have been identified by the dhs as high consequence public health threats will be supported. additionally, the proposed supplement project must focus on addressing adverse health outcomes after a single acute exposure event; therefore, research on prolonged, persistent, or chronic environmental chemical exposure is not within the scope of this nosi. note that clinical trials are not allowed. applications nonresponsive to the terms of this nosi will not be considered for award.eligibilitydescription of circumstances for which administrative supplements are available.application and submission informationapplications for this initiative must be submitted using the following opportunity or its subsequent reissued equivalent.all instructions in the sf424 (r&r) application guide and pa-20-272 must be followed, with the following additions:budgetresearch strategyplease direct all inquiries to:scientific/program contactdave yeung, ph.d. national institute of allergy and infectious diseases (niaid) telephone: 301-796-7237 email: dy70v@nih.govgrants management contactjason a lundgren national institute of allergy and infectious diseases (niaid) telephone: 240-669-2973 email: jason.lundgren@nih.govweekly toc for this announcement nih funding opportunities and noticesnote: for help accessing pdf, rtf, ms word, excel, powerpoint, audio or video files, see help downloading files.
