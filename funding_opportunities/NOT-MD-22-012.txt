disease prevention (odp)office of research on women's health (orwh)sexual and gender minority research office (sgmro)this notice is a reissue of and supersedes not-md-19-001 - notice of special interest in research on the health of sexual and gender minority (sgm) populations which calls for research on the health of sexual and gender minority populations. sgm populations include, but are not limited to, individuals who identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, asexual, transgender, two-spirit, queer, and/or intersex. individuals with same-sex or -gender attractions or behaviors and those with a difference in sex development are also included. these populations also encompass those who do not self-identify with one of these terms but whose sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, or reproductive development is characterized by non-binary constructs of sexual orientation, gender, and/or sex.although there has been an increase in sgm-focused health research in recent years, there remains a need for further research on the health of these populations. this notice encourages research that describes the biological, clinical, behavioral, and social processes that affect the health and development of sgm populations and individuals and their families, and that leads to the development of acceptable and appropriate health interventions and health service delivery methods that will enhance health and development of these populations.types of research which are relevant to this notice include, but are not limited to:ico specific application and submission informationnih ics have separately advanced funding opportunity announcements (foas) relevant to this nosi. these foas might be specific to each ic mission area. applicants must select the ic and associated foa to use for submission of an application in response to the nosi. the selection must align with the ic requirements listed in order to be considered responsive to that foa. non-responsive applications will be withdrawn from consideration for this initiative. in addition, applicants using nih parent announcements (listed below) will be assigned to those ics on this nosi that have indicated those foas are acceptable and based on usual application-ic assignment practices.all instructions in the sf424 (r&r) application guide and the funding opportunity announcement used for submission must be followed.investigators are strongly encouraged to reach out to the relevant contacts as listed below to identify which foas may be most appropriate for their proposed project or application.applicants must indicate the notice number (not-md-22-012) in the agency routing identifier field (box 4b) on the sf 424 application form and refer to not-md-22-012 in the abstract to assist in identifying applications submitted to this notice.nimhd areas of programmatic interest include but are not limited to:nimhd encourages projects to use approaches that encompass multiple domains (e.g., biological, behavioral, socio-cultural, environmental, physical environment, health system) and multiple levels (e.g., individual, interpersonal, community, societal) to understand and address health disparities in sgm populations (see the nimhd research framework, https://www.nimhd.nih.gov/about/overview/research-framework.html, for examples of health determinants of interest). animal studies and studies focused on sgm populations outside of the us are not priorities for nimhd under this notice.nccih is interested in supporting research on the use of complementary and integrative health approaches, including natural products and mind and body interventions, to manage stress, chronic pain, mild anxiety, or depression among sgm populations. nccih is also interested in research studying mind and body approaches to improve adherence to treatment (e.g., medication assisted treatment (mat) for opioid misuse, antiretroviral therapy (art) for hiv) and prevention (e.g., pre-exposure prophylaxis (prep) for hiv) regimens to promote health outcomes. natural products include botanicals, pre/probiotics, and products marketed as dietary supplements. mind and body approaches include various meditation approaches (e.g., mindfulness), hypnosis or guided imagery, meditative movement approaches (e.g., yoga, tai chi, qi-gong), body-based approaches (e.g., spinal manipulation, massage, mobilization, acupuncture), a combination of these approaches (e.g., meditation and yoga, such as in mindfulness-based stress reduction mbsr), or complex interventions including music and art therapy. nccih offers a range of funding opportunity announcements to support clinical trials of natural products and mind and body interventions. applicants are strongly encouraged to consult with the nccih scientific research contact prior to developing and submitting an application.nci areas of programmatic interest include (but are not limited to) studies that:nhgri supports the development of resources, approaches, and technologies that accelerate and support studies focused on the structure and biology of genomes; the genomics of disease; the implementation and effectiveness of genomic medicine; genomic data science and bioinformatics; and ethical, legal, and social issues related to genomic advances. more details about the institute’s vision and priority areas can be found in the 2020 nhgri strategic vision (https://www.genome.gov/2020sv).areas of programmatic interest to nhgri include but are not limited to:nhgri strongly encourages investigators that plan to collect phenotype and/or environmental exposure data about their study participants to utilize standard protocols included in the phenx toolkit (http://www.phenxtoolkit.org).nia is interested in research that can improve the understanding of aging processes and experiences that impact health and well-being in middle-aged and older sgm adults, and studies that use a life-course approach to examine how early life exposures contribute to sgm health disparities in adulthood. nia welcomes multilevel research focused on the level of the individual, dyad, family, population, and/or system, and the use of multidimensional components of sexual orientation (identity, attraction, and behavior) and gender identity. for studies with participants in the united states, nia strongly encourages researchers to use measures for the concepts of sex, gender identity, and sexual orientation and the guiding principles for data collection outlined in the nih-commissioned national academies’consensus study report measuring sex, gender identity, and sexual orientation (2022).nia is especially interested in aging-relevant sgm research with communities that are currently underrepresented in aging and clinical research; in particular, people who identify as transgender or intersex and/or people with differences of sex development (dsd), and members of other nia-designated priority populations, as specified in the nia health disparities research framework.nia is interested in interventions that are mechanism based and guided by the nih stage model framework and applicants are encouraged to follow the experimental medicine approach to intervention development promoted by the nih science of behavior change. studies focused on health equity and health disparities are expected to be guided by the nia health disparities research framework. nia encourages sgm research focused on alzheimer’s disease and alzheimer’s disease related dementias (ad/adrd). areas of ad/adrd research emphasis include, but are not limited to, those described in nia’s ad+adrd research implementation milestones.nia supports cross-national studies to better understand the aging experience on a global level and the effects of various policies. “natural experiments”, arising from policy change or regional differences, may provide another powerful approach for examining mechanisms affecting the health of sgm older adults. applicants are encouraged to leverage nia’s investment in data infrastructure and publicly available datasets, including but not limited to: the health and retirement study (hrs) and hrs’s international sister studies, midlife in the united states (midus), national social life, health, and aging project (nshap), national longitudinal study of adolescent to adult health (add health), study of women's health across the nation (swan), and the aging with pride: national health, aging, and sexuality/gender study (nhas). applicants are encouraged to consult with the nia’s office of data resources and analytics (odra) for guidance on the use of data in nia’s infrastructure projects.areas of programmatic interest to nia include but are not limited to:niaid areas of programmatic interest include but are not limited to:niams has the mission to support research into the causes, treatment, and prevention of arthritis and musculoskeletal and skin diseases; the training of basic and clinical scientists to carry out this research; and the dissemination of information on research progress in these diseases. niams also conducts and supports basic research on the normal structure and function of bones, joints, muscles, and skin. basic research involves a wide variety of scientific disciplines, including immunology, genetics, molecular biology, structural biology, biochemistry, physiology, virology, and pharmacology. clinical research areas include rheumatology, orthopaedics, dermatology, metabolic bone diseases, heritable disorders of bone and cartilage, inherited and inflammatory muscle diseases, and sports and rehabilitation medicine. niams also seeks studies that include sufficient numbers of sgm individuals to enable robust sub-group analyses. clinical trials designed to answer specific questions about the safety, tolerability, efficacy, effectiveness, clinical management, and/or implementation of pharmacologic, behavioral, biologic, surgical, or device (invasive or non-invasive) interventions will only be supported by niams if submitted to a niams clinical trials-specific foa. a current list of active niams clinical trials foas is available at https://www.niams.nih.gov/grants-funding/conducting-clinical-research/grants. for information regarding niams supported scientific areas/programs and contacts, please see: https://www.niams.nih.gov/grants-funding/supported-scientific-areas.nichd mission is to lead research and training to understand human development, improve reproductive health, enhance the lives of children and adolescents, and optimize abilities for all. nichd's broad and diverse research portfolio includes research related to conception and pregnancy; typical and atypical development in childhood; childhood trauma, injury, and critical illness; the transition from adolescence to adulthood; reproductive health; rehabilitation; intellectual, developmental, and physical disabilities; and population dynamics across the lifespan.for this nosi, nichd seeks applications addressing issues in sgm health that are aligned with nichd scientific priorities. nichd high priority populations include children and adolescents, pregnant and lactating people, and people of all ages with physical and/or intellectual disabilities. areas of interest include, but are not limited to:nidcd welcomes responsive applications involving sgm populations with communication disorders including those affecting hearing, balance, taste, smell, voice, speech, and language. in particular, research to identify and reduce health care disparities and inequities in the sgm population in the areas of nidcd’s scientific mission are encouraged. nidcd also encourages applications focused on research on gender affirming intervention to facilitate congruence between an individual’s voice and/or other aspects of their communication and their gender identity and/or gender expression. research to improve the evidence base for voice intervention with sgm populations is also highly encouraged.nidcr areas of programmatic interest include but are not limited to:niddk supports medical research and research training and dissemination of science-based information on diabetes and other endocrine and metabolic diseases; digestive diseases, nutritional disorders, and obesity; and kidney, urologic, and hematologic diseases, to improve people’s health and quality of life. niddk encourages research on sex/gender differences, sexual and gender minority-related research and race/ethnic diversity as defined in not-dk-22-003 (https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/not-dk-22-003.html). more specifically, niddk encourages investigators to consider research on differences in health status across biological and social constructs of identity. the potential implications of these concepts should be considered in research across multiple levels, from genes to hormones, to complex biological systems, to social and ecological interactions. assessing the contributions of these biological and social constructs of identity can assist in understanding variations in health outcomes among sgm populations, across niddk research mission areas.nida areas of programmatic interest include but are not limited to:niehs areas of programmatic interest include but are not limited to:ninds is interested in mission relevant applications. in addition to the above topics, ninds is interested in funding applications that enrich scientific understanding of how sexual orientation, gender identity, and/or being born with differences/disorders in sex development (dsds) or intersex characteristics relate to health outcomes, health risks, health behaviors, perceptions and expectations about health, and access to health-related services or associated barriers as they pertain to the ninds mission. the ninds supports basic, clinical, translational, and implementation research focused on identifying, monitoring, and targeting biological, environmental, social, community, structural, and healthcare system factors that lead to or are associated disparities (or inequities) in neurological diseases and care across the lifespan. some priority disease areas include stroke and other cerebrovascular diseases, alzheimer’s disease-related dementias (including frontotemporal neurodegeneration, lewy body dementias, vascular contributions to cognitive impairment and dementia and mixed etiology dementia), epilepsy, migraine, nervous system infections, spinal cord injury, headache, parkinson's disease, and other neurodegenerative disorders, brain trauma, neurodevelopmental disorders, and the neurological consequences of hiv/aids. observational studies should be theory-based to enable the future development of actionable items and evidence-based interventions. applicants are encouraged to incorporate community engagement strategies into their study designs. a letter of intent and communication with ninds program staff prior to submission of an application is strongly encouraged. research activities outside of the ninds mission, or traditionally supported by another nih institute or center, will not be considered through this program.for pa-20-183, only mechanistic clinical trials will be accepted in accordance with not-ns-18-011. applicants wishing to propose other clinical trials (i.e., efficacy, effectiveness, feasibility, acceptability, and implementation) through separate foas should consider reviewing submission guidelines listed on the ninds clinical trials website. a letter of intent and communication with ninds program staff prior to submission of an application is strongly encouragedninr supports research to solve pressing health challenges and inform practice and policy - optimizing health and advancing health equity into the future. ninr discovers solutions to health challenges through the lenses of health equity, social determinants of health, population and community health, prevention and health promotion, and systems and models of care. drawing on the strengths of nursing’s holistic, contextualized perspective, core values, and broad reach, ninr funds multilevel and cross-sectoral research that examines the factors that impact health across the many settings in which nurses work, including homes, schools, workplaces, clinics, justice settings, and the community. observational, intervention, and implementation research are of interest.areas of programmatic interest to ninr include but are not limited toorwh is interested in projects of relevance to the health of sgm women and individuals assigned female at birth, especially projects that consider sex and/or gender in intersection with other social determinants of health. specific areas of interest include, but are not limited to,:application and submission informationthis notice applies to due
