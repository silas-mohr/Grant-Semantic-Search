development of innovative technologies, methods, tools, models or designs (for brevity, here onwards referred to as tools) that have the potential for significant impact on biomedical research by infusing principles and concepts from quantitative sciences. the purpose of this foa is to encourage brg applications that: 1) apply a multidisciplinary approach to solve biomedical problems; and 2) develop, integrate, optimize, validate, translate or accelerate adoption of promising tools, methods, and techniques for a specific research or clinical problem in basic, translational, and/or clinical science and practice. a brg application may propose design-directed, developmental, discovery-driven, or hypothesis-driven research and the foa is appropriate for small teams applying an integrative approach to increase our understanding of and solve problems in biological, clinical, or translational science.research objectivesmany major biomedical research problems are best addressed with a multidisciplinary approach that bridges life sciences and physical sciences. principles and techniques in quantitative sciences such as physics, mathematics, chemistry, computer sciences, and engineering are increasingly applied to enable and advance biomedical research. bioengineering approaches integrate principles from diverse technical and biomedical fields, and the resulting multi-disciplinary research provides new understanding, innovative technologies, and new products that improve basic knowledge, human health, and quality of life. this foa seeks to encourage collaborations among investigators in the fields of quantitative science and physical science with biomedical researchers to catalyze the development of innovative bioengineering approaches to solve important problems in biomedical research, translational research, clinical investigations, and medical practice.significant projects may include, but are not limited to: development, validation, and translation of promising modalities for the disease continuum, including tools for risk prediction, screening, prevention, detection, diagnosis, disease progression, intervention, monitoring treatment response, prognosis, or survival; development of quantitative, predictive models of complex biological systems; integration and optimization of technologies that significantly increase sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, efficiency, or throughput of analysis to address unsolved biological or medical questions; in vitro and in vivo models, cell/tissue culture systems and organoids that closely mimic physiological conditions and allow mechanistic studies or engineering and testing of delivery systems, molecules/cells/tissues for therapeutic purposes, therapeutics, implants, and prosthetics that may improve treatment and healthcare.innovation in this biomedical engineering foa has a broad definition that includes development of new methods, ideas, or tools, integration of existing components into new combinations that deliver new and/or greater capabilities, new efficiencies, and/or greater effects. overall impact of these advances may include improving our understanding of molecular mechanisms, reducing disparities in access to care, promoting wellness and independent living, increasing access to and utility of technologies to improve quality of life, reducing the cost and complexity of procedures, and/or increasing throughput, sensitivity, and specificity of diagnostic tests.a project must clearly serve the mission of one or more of the nih institutes or centers participating in this foa. investigators are encouraged to contact the designated scientific/research contacts for individual institute focus areas that will be supported. applicants who seek to establish proof-of-concept are encouraged to respond to the exploratory bioengineering research grant (ebrg) foa [https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/pa-files/par-22-091.html].ic-specific interestsnational institute of dental and craniofacial research (nidcr)the nidcr conducts and fosters research on the
