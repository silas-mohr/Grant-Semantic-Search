the following nih offices may co-fund applications assigned to those institutes/centers.division of program coordination, planning and strategic initiatives, office of disease prevention (odp)the national institute of environmental health science (niehs), in partnership with fogarty international center (fic), national institute of minority health and health disparities (nimhd), eunice kennedy shriver national institute of child health and human development (nichd), national institute of mental health (nimh), national institute of nursing research (ninr), national heart blood and lung institute (nhbli) and national institute of allergy and infectious disease (niaid) is leading an nih-wide climate change and health initiative (cchi) with the goals of: reducing the health threats posed by climate change across the lifespan; improving the health of people who are at increased risk from or disparately affected by climate change impacts; and building health resilience among individuals, communities, tribal nations, and nations around the world, thereby increasing health equity. as a part of this cchi, this nosi encourages applications that address the impact of climate change on health and well-being over the life course, including the health implications of climate change in the united states and globally.background climate change poses substantial threats to human health across the life span. these threats influence health concerns including communicable and non-communicable diseases, injuries, hazardous exposures, mental health, and death. health outcomes can be affected directly by climate change through weather events such as extreme heat, wildfires, droughts, storm surges, and floods, and indirectly through a series of exposure pathways that include air and water quality, food quality, infectious diseases, and population displacement events. exposure pathways are influenced by environmental contexts related to land use, geography, infrastructure, and agriculture, as well as social, behavioral, and economic contexts that create vulnerabilities associated with life stage, gender, poverty, discrimination, and access to care.the elevated threats to human health from climate change occur across a wide range of illnesses and injuries, including: asthma, respiratory allergies and airway diseases, cancers, cardiovascular disease and stroke, foodborne diseases and decreased nutrition, heat-related illness and deaths, reproductive, birth outcome, and developmental effects, mental health and neurological disorders, vector borne and zoonotic diseases, waterborne diseases, and extreme weather-related morbidity and mortality. understanding the health implications – including potential health benefits -- of actions to prevent, mitigate, and adapt to climate change offers opportunities to improve the social and environmental determinants of health, especially for at-risk communities.as with many health outcomes, populations including children, older adults, women and pregnant women, and persons with disabilities, among others, may be disproportionally at risk. strong evidence indicates that climate change disproportionately adversely affects communities that experience social , and environmental vulnerabilities. such communities could include american indian/alaskan native, asian americans, blacks/african americans, hispanic/latinos, native hawaiian and other pacific islanders, sexual and gender minorities, socioeconomically disadvantaged populations, underserved rural populations, and those unduly burdened by exposure to environmental pollution. in the united states and globally, structural racism and discrimination contribute to the higher risk from health impacts of climate change.this list of influences, pathways, and health outcomes is not comprehensive, and the variability of these influences on health creates challenges for attribution to climate change. while the burden of disease attributable to climate change has not yet been reliably estimated, indicators point to a reversal of long-term u.s. and global trends of improvements in population health due to climate change. as the impact of climate change on human health increases, attribution becomes less important than intervention.the nih climate change and health initiative strategic framework summarizes the initial planning and development of an nih-wide research initiative on the impacts of climate change on people’s health. the goal of the nih-wide climate chance and health initiative is to support research and training that reduce health threats from climate change across the lifespan and build health resilience in individuals, communities, and nations around the world, especially among those at highest risk. high priority applications will focus on nih-priority populations and propose transdisciplinary research that falls broadly into the core elements and supporting areas of science outlined in the strategic framework.topics of interest include but are not limited to the following:nih’s broad scientific expertise situates it in a unique position to tackle the complex set of factors that coalesce in the problem of climate change impacts on health. nih is made up of 27 institutes and centers (ics), each with a specific research mission and priorities. listed below are ic specific cch interest areas.nidathe mission of the national institute on drug abuse (nida) is to advance science on the causes and consequences of drug use and addiction and to apply that knowledge to improve individual and public health. nida is interested in supporting research relevant to advancing the understanding of the effects of climate change on substance use and the identification and development of innovative strategies, prevention, and intervention methods, as well as policy changes to reduce negative effects due to climate change. in addition, nida is interested in supporting research with consideration for populations that experience health disparities in substance use, who are also likely to experience a disproportionate burden of effects from climate change. priority areas include, but are not limited to:niehsthe mission of the national institute of environmental health sciences (niehs) is to discover how the environment affects people to promote healthier lives. the niehs is interested in supporting research that addresses the impact of climate change on environmental health and innovative approaches to the development of prevention and intervention strategies to reduce the impacts of climate change on environmental health, particularly in communities most susceptible to these impacts examples of environmental exposures relevant to the mission of the niehs include, but are not limited to, industrial chemicals or manufacturing byproducts, e-waste, metals, pesticides, herbicides, and inhaled toxicants, extreme weather, and the environmental impacts of natural and man-made disasters. niehs supports research on climate change and health that examines the interplay between environmental exposures and individual and structural-level (e.g., structural racism) social determinants of health. climate and health topics of particular interest to niehs include (but are not limited to):ncithe national cancer institute (nci) coordinates the national cancer program, which conducts and supports research and training efforts to improve cancer prevention, reduce the risk, incidence, and deaths from cancer, and enhance the quality of life of cancer survivors. the nci is interested in supporting research relevant to advancing the understanding of the effects of climate change on cancer risks, control, and survivorship, and ways to prevent or mitigate negative health effects. given that the impacts of climate change vary by geographic region and social and economic circumstances, the nci is particularly interested in supporting research with consideration for populations that experience cancer health disparities and are likely to experience a disproportionate burden of effects from a changing climate. priority areas include, but are not limited to, observational and/or interventional research examining:nidcrthe national institute of dental and craniofacial research (nidcr) supports multidisciplinary research to understand the direct and/or indirect impact of climate change (i.e. climate-induced changes on human health and/or supplies of food, water, housing, and health care) on disparities and inequities of dental, oral, and craniofacial diseases, conditions, and care access. in addition, nidcr has interests in research that examines strategies to enhance resilience of communities and/or populations disproportionately affected by dental, oral and craniofacial health disparities and inequities at the time of climate-induced public health emergencies.nimhas the lead federal agency for research on mental disorders, nimh is interested in the following areas:nimhdthe mission of the nimhd is to lead scientific research to improve minority health and reduce health disparities. nimhd focuses on all aspects of health and health care for racial and ethnic minority populations in the u.s. and the full continuum of health disparity causes as well as the interrelation of these causes. nimhd projects must include a focus on one or more of the following populations that nih-designates as experiencing health disparities in the united states and its territories: african americans, latinos/hispanics, american indians and alaska natives, asian americans, native hawaiians and other pacific islanders, less privileged socioeconomic groups, underserved rural populations, and sexual and gender minorities. comparison groups/populations may also be included as appropriate for the research questions posed. nimhd encourages projects that use approaches encompassing multiple domains of influence (e.g., biological, behavioral, sociocultural, environmental, physical environment, health system) and multiple levels of influence (e.g., individual, interpersonal, family, peer group, community, societal) to understand and address health disparities (see the nimhd research framework, https://www.nimhd.nih.gov/about/overview/research-framework.html, for more information). studies focusing on building resilience to reduce or deter the effects of climate change among populations who experience health disparities are encouraged. studies using animal models or studies based outside the u.s. or its territories will not be supported by nimhd under this nosi.nindsthe national institute of neurological disorders and stroke (ninds) will accept applications that study the effect of climate change on the development, progression, and recovery of neurological disorders across the lifespan. this includes environmental effects of climate change that affect neurological disorders within the ninds mission (see ninds). applications with a primary focus on climate change and health outside of the united states (u.s.) would be considered non-responsive to this funding announcement. applications that propose research on toxins or other factors that are not related to climate change will also be considered non-responsive to this funding announcement. applications that build on existing programs and cohorts involving at-risk groups and underserved populations in the u.s. are encouraged. we are accepting applications from the following announcements: pa-20-184 research project grant (parent r01 basic experimental studies with humans required), pa-20-185 nih research project grant (parent r01 clinical trial not allowed), pa-20-196 nih exploratory/developmental research grant program (parent r21 basic experimental studies with humans required), pa-20-195 nih exploratory/developmental research grant program (parent r21 clinical trial not allowed). applicants are strongly encouraged to contact ninds scientific/research staff prior to their submission to discuss the responsiveness of their application.nlmthe national library of medicine, the largest biomedical library in the world, is committed to meeting the evolving needs of the research and clinical communities and to serve the public at large. the nlm's research in information science, informatics, and data science is focused on meeting the challenges of this rapidly changing biomedical space. the nlm areas of research interest include: representation, organization and retrieval of biomedical and

analyses for natural language processing and understanding; informatics topics relevant to public health and informatics for disaster management. the nlm is dedicated to training the next generation of data scientists and informaticists while focusing on providing accurate knowledge and resources to communities and individuals, especially those with health disparities.niania is interested in understanding the behavioral, biological, and socioecological processes related to climate change and extreme weather that affect the health and wellbeing of older individuals, as examined in human and/or animals. applicants are encouraged to consider innovative methods and research designs to facilitate studies within groups (e.g., racial/ethnic) as well as between groups, recognizing within-group heterogeneity in individuals’ access to resources and lived experiences. applicants should reference the nia health disparities research framework. research topics of interest include, but are not limited to:niaidthe niaid mission is to conduct and support basic and applied research to better understand, treat, and ultimately prevent infectious, immunologic, and allergic diseases. climatic variations are known to be associated with changes in incidence, prevalence, and severity of multiple infectious and allergic diseases. for this notice, areas of interest include, but are not limited to:ninrninr identified five complementary and synergistic research lenses that leverage the strengths of nursing research and promote multilevel approaches, cross-disciplinary and -sectoral collaboration, and community engagement in research. the research lenses are:these lenses are perspectives through which to consider the full spectrum of nursing research topics that encompass health and illness within the context of people’s lived experiences. researchers can apply a single or a combination of lenses in their study designs and training programs. for addressing the effects of climate change on health, the ninr encourages researchers to view the health equity and social determinants of health lenses as primary foci through which to consider the population and community health, prevention and health promotion, and systems and models of care lenses. more details about ninr’s priorities can be found here.nhlbinhlbi is restricting our interest in this nosi to two funding announcements: pa-20-185- research project grant (parent r01clinical trial not allowed) and pa-20-183- research project grant (parent r01clinical trial required). nhlbi only allows mechanistic

childhood; childhood trauma, injury, and critical illness; the transition from adolescence to adulthood; reproductive health; rehabilitation; intellectual, developmental, and physical disabilities; and population dynamics across the lifespan.in response to this nosi, topics of interest to nichd include, but are not limited to, research on:the following topic areas are not within scope for this nosi:potential applicants need to verify ic participation in specific funding announcements (see table below under "application and submission information). applicants are encouraged to contact program staff at ics to confirm scientific fit with ic priorities on climate change and health.data harmonizationnih is striving for consistency and high levels of rigor and reproducibility in all research. one way to accomplish this is to encourage investigators to use a common set of tools and resources to facilitate collection of common data elements (cdes) or, in the case of existing data/records apply common constructs. nih has worked with relevant communities to develop and provide access to tools and resources that can improve consistency of data collection. nih strongly encourages investigators collecting data to use these resources as they select instruments for their proposed studies and devise programs to construct research data files.nih common data elements (cde) repository has been designed to provide access to structured human and machine-readable definitions of data elements that have been recommended or required by nih institutes and centers and other organizations for use in research and for other purposes. the the phenx toolkit is a large collection of well-established and vetted phenotypic measurement protocols, including its newly released social determinants of health collections. the dr2 program has curated a repository of data collection tools and related resources to empower human health research in response to disasters and public health emergencies. these protocols are suitable for inclusion in climate change-related studies, enabling data harmonization across studies.data management and sharingidentifying and sharing data to support innovative climate change and health research is a goal of this nosi. all applicants, whether collecting new data or using existing data as part of proposed research, must submit a data management and sharing plan.projects collecting data should use best practices in data sharing to accelerate the scientific community’s ability to advance knowledge about the relationship between climate change and health. researchers are encouraged to ensure that the data resources that they produce meet the standard for being fair—findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable, and further elaborated upon by force 11. nih strongly encourages use of nih-supported, domain-specific data repositories as a first choice for storing data and making it accessible (see nlm data sharing resources). in instances where captured/re-used data is not directly sharable by the applicant, plans for providing access protocols and programs to allow third-party researchers to replicate proposed research data files are necessary to meet data sharing requirements. specifically, this includes information describing the data source and how any investigator can apply for data access, computer code used to convert data from the capture source into research data files, explanations of any variables constructed by the investigators, and other relevant information required to assist the use of data from the source for replication studies.application and submission informationthis notice applies to due dates on or after july 8, 2022 and subsequent receipt dates through may
