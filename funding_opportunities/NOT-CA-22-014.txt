develop and test measures of related teamwork constructs; or develop and pilot test interventions. r01s may support larger observational studies or studies that evaluate interventions designed to improve care quality and patient outcomes by cultivating interprofessional teamwork and coordination during cancer diagnosis and treatment. applicants are encouraged to identify the specific aspects of teamwork that are being tested to isolate their effects on variability in specified patient outcomes.examples of responsive proposals include:research encouraged through this notice includes but is not limited to, studies that:applicants are encouraged to review any non-responsive criteria listed in the funding opportunity announcement (foa) through which they plan to apply to this nosi.application and submission informationthis notice applies to due dates on or after february 5, 2022, and subsequent receipt dates through october 9, 2024.submit applications for this initiative using one of the following funding opportunity announcements (foas) or any reissues of these announcement through the expiration date of this notice.all instructions in the sf424 (r&r) application guide and the funding opportunity announcement used for submission must be followed, with the following additions:applications nonresponsive to terms of this nosi will be withdrawn from consideration for this initiative.scientific/research contact(s)sallie j. weaver, phd, mhs national cancer institute (nci) telephone: (240) 276-6254 email: sallie.weaver@nih.govveronica chollette, rn, ms national cancer institute (nci) telephone: (240) 276-6969 email: cholletv@nih.govpeer review contact(s)examine your era commons account for review assignment and contact information (information appears two weeks after the submission due date).financial/grants management contact(s)crystal wolfrey national cancer institute (nci) telephone: 240-276-6277 email: wolfreyc@mail.nih.govweekly toc for this announcement nih funding opportunities and noticesnote: for help accessing pdf, rtf, ms word, excel, powerpoint, audio or video files, see help downloading files.
