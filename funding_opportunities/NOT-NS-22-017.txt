(nci)national eye institute (nei)national institute on aging (nia)national institute of dental and craniofacial research (nidcr)national cancer institute (nci)the sbir technology transfer (sbir-tt) notice of special interest (nosi) is intended to help move commercially-viable technologies from the nih intramural program to the marketplace. small business concerns (sbcs) are encouraged to submit applications that further develop available technologies from the nih intramural program and bring them to the commercial market. while universities can spin off companies, use incubator resources, and obtain funding from venture capital, the nih intramural programs have no similar mechanism to develop technologies. if selected for sbir funding, the sbc will be granted a royalty-free, non-exclusive patent license agreement for internal research use for the term of and within the field of use of the sbir award to technologies held by nih with the intent that the sbc will develop the invention into a commercial product to benefit the public. for a complete listing of nih intramural technologies which are available, please see nih office of technology transfer at: https://www.ott.nih.gov or the web sites of the technology transfer offices of the participating institutes.the nih intramural research program leverages the unique nih research environment to perform
