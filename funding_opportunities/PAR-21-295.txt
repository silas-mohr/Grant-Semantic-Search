funding opportunity description section ii. award information section iii. eligibility information section iv. application and submission information section v. application review information section vi. award administration information section vii. agency contacts section viii. other informationthe overall goal of the nih research career development program is to help ensure that a diverse pool of highly trained scientists is available in appropriate scientific disciplines to address the nation's biomedical, behavioral, and clinical research needs. nih institutes and centers (ics) support a variety of mentored and non-mentored career development award programs designed to foster the transition of new investigators to research independence and to support established investigators in achieving specific objectives. candidates should review the different career development (k) award programs to determine the best program to support their goals. more information about career programs may be found at the nih research training and career development website.this funding opportunity announcement (foa) is a continuation of the nci mentored research scientist development award to promote diversity (k01) to enhance the diversity in the nci-funded cancer research workforce by supporting eligible individuals from diverse backgrounds, including groups that have been shown to be nationally underrepresented in the biomedical, behavioral, social and clinical sciences. this funding opportunity announcement (foa) provides salary and research support for a sustained period of "protected time" (3-5 years) for intensive research career development under the guidance of an experienced mentor. the expectation is that through this sustained period of research career development and training, awardees will be in a position to launch independent research careers and become competitive for new research project grant (e.g., r01) funding. candidates with clinical degrees (e.g., md) and those interested in patient-oriented research may wish to consider the nci mentored clinical scientist award to promote diversity award (k08) as a more appropriate alternative relative to their stage of development and career goals.substantial national and local efforts are directed toward a reduction in cancer morbidity and mortality in the general population. however, in spite of these efforts, the american cancer society estimates that in 2021, approximately 1.9 million new cancer cases will be diagnosed, and 608,570 cancer deaths will occur. past patterns of cancer incidence and mortality predict that the disproportionate increase in u.s. cancer incidence and mortality will be experienced by underserved populations (cancer facts & figures 2021). specifically, cancer rates for stomach, liver, gall bladder, and cervix are higher in hispanics than in non-hispanic whites (cancer facts and statistics). stomach and liver cancer incidence and death rates are more than twice as high in asian american/pacific islanders as in caucasians, and mortality rates from prostate, stomach, and cervical cancers among african americans are more than twice those in caucasians.a reduction in the overall cancer mortality rate in underserved populations would substantially impact known cancer statistics. a major obstacle to developing a stronger national health disparities cancer research effort has been the lack of significant strategic training programs for students and scientists. greater involvement of students and scientists from diverse backgrounds who can bring diversity of thought is integral to a successful national cancer research effort involving more underserved patients and populations.according to the report of the advisory committee to the director working group on diversity in the biomedical research workforce, individuals from historically underrepresented groups do not fare well in securing nih funds to conduct biomedical and behavioral research. for example, american indians or alaska natives, african americans, hispanics or latinos (of any race), and native hawaiian and pacific islanders make up a disproportionately small component of the nih principal investigator pool. (diversitybiomedicalresearchworkforcereport).the national science foundation reports that blacks or african americans, hispanics or latinos, american indians or alaska natives, native hawaiians and other pacific islanders are underrepresented at many career stages in health-related sciences on a national basis (see the report women, minorities, and persons with disabilities in science and engineering, 2021). individuals from these groups are under-represented when compared to their age-cohorts in science-baccalaureate earners, among science-phd earners, and in the biomedical workforce. moreover, among science and engineering doctorate holders with full-time faculty employment at any four-year institution, those from underrepresented racial and ethnic groups were less likely to receive federal grants or contracts than their white counterparts.the americans with disabilities act (ada) defines an individual with a disability as a person with a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities. in 2010, the bureau of the census reported that nearly 20 percent of the united states population had a disability. the national center for education statistics (nces) reported that in 2012, 11 percent of college students had a disability, and 34 percent of undergraduates with disabilities are from underrepresented racial and ethnic groups. according to the council of graduate schools and statistics from nces, in 2008 about seven percent of all doctoral students and about six percent of doctoral students in health or life science programs had a disability.the lack of diversity of the biomedical and behavioral research workforce, which may be due to a failure of support infrastructure at various levels, is a source of concern to the nih. thus, evidence-based interventions that broaden participation in science careers and those that promote successful transitions at the various career stages have been proposed: (from the nih: a systems approach to increasing the diversity of the biomedical research workforce.) and (p01: scientific workforce diversity -opportunity for enhancing research excellence).nci is committed to making sure that all americans share equally in the medical advances that result from cancer research, and that current disparities in the burden of several diseases, including cancers, are reduced or eliminated. as part of that mission, nci is helping to build a diverse workforce for the biomedical sciences—a critical step in reducing the burden of cancer for an increasingly diverse america. this includes providing a smoother path towards careers in science and medicine as an important means to attract and engage the nation's most talented students, especially those from backgrounds nationally underrepresented in cancer research and care.every facet of the united states scientific research enterprise—from basic laboratory research to clinical and translational research to policy formation —requires superior intellect, creativity and a wide range of skill sets and viewpoints. nih's ability to help ensure that the nation remains a global leader in scientific discovery and innovation is dependent upon a pool of highly talented scientists from diverse backgrounds who will help to further nih's mission.research shows that diverse teams working together and capitalizing on innovative ideas and distinct perspectives outperform homogenous teams. scientists and trainees from diverse backgrounds and life experiences bring different perspectives, creativity, and individual enterprise to address complex scientific problems. there are many benefits that flow from a diverse nih-supported scientific workforce, including: fostering scientific innovation, enhancing global competitiveness, contributing to robust learning environments, improving the quality of the researchers, advancing the likelihood that underserved or health disparity populations participate in, and benefit from health research, and enhancing public trust.promoting diversity in the extramural scientific workforce is critical to the success of nih/nci mission, and is consistent with the mandates of the 21st century cures act. while scientific workforce diversity supports the nih/nci mission (see, not-od-20-031), expanding the pool of investigators from nationally underrepresented backgrounds in the biomedical research workforce remains an elusive goal (see: policy supporting the next generation researchers initiative, not-od-17-101).specific research objectivesthis foa establishes a pathway of recruiting, training, and retaining investigators from diverse backgrounds in research fields that address problems pertinent to the biology, etiology, pathogenesis, prevention, diagnosis, control, and treatment of human cancers and who can conduct independent competitive cancer research. those candidates pursuing emerging technologies and cancer health disparities research are also encouraged to apply.programmatic approachthe program will provide successful candidates with professional development workshop opportunities and mock review experiences to enhance their knowledge and understanding of the nih peer review system and to develop the skills required to prepare competitive grant applications to nih and other funding agencies. to this end, the nci will:special note: prospective applicants are strongly encouraged to consult with nci scientific/research contact listed under section vii.note: this funding opportunity announcement (foa) is designed specifically for applicants proposing research that does not involve leading an independent clinical trial, a clinical trial feasibility study, or a separate ancillary clinical trial. applicants proposing a clinical trial or a separate ancillary clinical trial as lead investigator, should apply to the companion foa (par-21-296). applicants to this foa are permitted to propose research experience in a clinical trial led by a mentor or co-mentor.see section viii. other information for award authorities and regulations.grant: a support mechanism providing money, property, or both to an eligible entity to carry out an approved project or activity.new resubmissionthe oer glossary and the sf424 (r&r) application guide provide details on these application types. only those application types listed here are allowed for this foa.not allowed: only accepting applications that do not propose clinical trialsnote: applicants may propose to gain experience in a clinical trial led by a mentor/co-mentor as part of their research career development.need help determining whether you are doing a clinical trial?the number of awards is contingent upon nih appropriations and the submission of a sufficient number of meritorious applications.award budgets are composed of salary and other program-related expenses, as described below.the total project period may not exceed 5 years.not applicable.nih will contribute $30,000 per year toward the research development costs of the award recipient, which must be justified and consistent with the stage of development of the candidate and the proportion of time to be spent in research or career development activities. these funds may be used for the following expenses: (a) tuition and fees related to career development; (b) research-related expenses, such as supplies, equipment and technical personnel; (c) travel to research meetings or training; and (d) statistical services including personnel and computer time.salary for mentors, secretarial and administrative assistants, etc. is not allowed.indirect costs (also known as facilities & administrative [f&a] costs) are reimbursed at 8% of modified total direct costs.nih grant policies as described in the nih grants policy statement will apply to the applications submitted and awards made from this foa.higher education institutionsthe following types of higher education institutions are always encouraged to apply for nih support as public or private institutions of higher education:nonprofits other than institutions of higher educationfor-profit organizationsgovernmentsothernon-domestic (non-u.s.) entities (foreign institutions) are not eligible to apply. non-domestic (non-u.s.) components of u.s. organizations are not eligible to apply. foreign components, as defined in the nih grants policy statement, are not allowed.applicant organizationsapplicant organizations must complete and maintain the following registrations as described in the sf 424 (r&r) application guide to be eligible to apply for or receive an award. all registrations must be completed prior to the application being submitted. registration can take 6 weeks or more, so applicants should begin the registration process as soon as possible. the nih policy on late submission of grant applications states that failure to complete registrations in advance of a due date is not a valid reason for a late submission.program directors/principal investigators (pd(s)/pi(s))all pd(s)/pi(s) must have an era commons account. pd(s)/pi(s) should work with their organizational officials to either create a new account or to affiliate their existing account with the applicant organization in era commons. if the pd/pi is also the organizational signing official, they must have two distinct era commons accounts, one for each role. obtaining an era commons account can take up to 2 weeks.all pd(s)/pi(s) must be registered with orcid. the personal profile associated with the pd(s)/pi(s) era commons account must be linked to a valid orcid id. for more information on linking an orcid id to an era commons personal profile see the orcid topic in our era commons online help.any candidate who meets the eligibility (see enhancing diversity, below) and possesses the skills, knowledge, and resources necessary to carry out the proposed research as the program director/principal investigator (pd/pi) is invited to work with his/her mentor and organization to develop an application for support. multiple pds/pis are not allowed.by the time of award, the individual must be a citizen or a non-citizen national of the united states or have been lawfully admitted for permanent residence (i.e., possess a currently valid permanent resident card uscis form i-551, or other legal verification of such status.)current and former pds/pis on nih research project (r01), program project (p01), center grants (p50), or project leads of program project (p01), or center grants (p50), other major individual career development awards (e.g., dp5, k01, k07, k08, k22, k23, k25, k76, k99/r00), or the equivalent are not eligible. current and former pds/pis of an nih small grant (r03), exploratory/developmental grant (r21/r33), planning grant (r34/u34), dissertation award (r36), or sbir/sttr (r41, r42, r43, r44) remain eligible, as do pd/pis of transition scholar (k38) awards and individuals appointed to institutional k programs (k12, kl2).candidates for the k01 award must have a research or health-professional doctoral degree.this funding opportunity may support individuals who propose to train in a new field or individuals who have had a hiatus in their research career because of illness or pressing family circumstances.career stage: the intent of this k01 program is to support cancer research scientists in their early career stages. candidates must have completed at least two, but usually not more than five years of research training/experience beyond a doctoral degree at the time of submitting a k01 application.enhancing diversityin spite of tremendous advancements in scientific research, information, educational and research opportunities are not equally available to all. nih encourages institutions to diversify their student and faculty populations to enhance the participation of individuals from groups that are underrepresented in the biomedical, clinical, behavioral and social sciences (not-od-20-031), such as:a. individuals from racial and ethnic groups that have been shown by the national science foundation to be underrepresented in health-related sciences on a national basis (see data at http://www.nsf.gov/statistics/showpub.cfm?topid=2&subid=27) and the report women, minorities, and persons with disabilities in science and engineering). the following racial and ethnic groups have been shown to be underrepresented in biomedical research: blacks or african americans, hispanics or latinos, american indians or alaska natives, native hawaiians and other pacific islanders. in addition, it is recognized that underrepresentation can vary from setting to setting; individuals from racial or ethnic groups that can be demonstrated convincingly to be underrepresented by the grantee institution should be encouraged to participate in nih programs to enhance diversity. for more information on racial and ethnic categories and definitions, see the omb revisions to the standards for classification of federal data on race and ethnicity (https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/fr-1997-10-30/html/97-28653.htm).b. individuals with disabilities, who are defined as those with a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities, as described in the americans with disabilities act of 1990, as amended. see nsf data at, https://www.nsf.gov/statistics/2017/nsf17310/static/data/tab7-5.pdf.c. individuals from disadvantaged backgrounds, defined as those who meet two or more of the following criteria:1. were or currently are homeless, as defined by the mckinney-vento homeless assistance act (definition: https://nche.ed.gov/mckinney-vento/);2. were or currently are in the foster care system, as defined by the administration for children and families (definition: https://www.acf.hhs.gov/cb/focus-areas/foster-care);3. were eligible for the federal free and reduced lunch program for two or more years (definition: https://www.fns.usda.gov/school-meals/income-eligibility-guidelines);4. have/had no parents or legal guardians who completed a bachelor’s degree (see https://nces.ed.gov/pubs2018/2018009.pdf);5. were or currently are eligible for federal pell grants (definition: https://www2.ed.gov/programs/fpg/eligibility.html);6. received support from the special supplemental nutrition program for women, infants and children (wic) as a parent or child (definition: https://www.fns.usda.gov/wic/wic-eligibility-requirements).7. grew up in one of the following areas: a) a u.s. rural area, as designated by the health resources and services administration (hrsa) rural health grants eligibility analyzer (https://data.hrsa.gov/tools/rural-health), or b) a centers for medicare and medicaid services-designated low-income and health professional shortage areas (qualifying zipcodes are included in the file). only one of the two possibilities in #7 can be used as a criterion for the disadvantaged background definition.students from low socioeconomic (ses) status backgrounds have been shown to obtain bachelor’s and advanced degrees at significantly lower rates than students from middle and high ses groups (see https://nces.ed.gov/programs/coe/indicator_tva.asp), and are subsequently less likely to be represented in biomedical research. for background see department of education data at, https://nces.ed.gov/; https://nces.ed.gov/programs/coe/indicator_tva.asp; https://www2.ed.gov/rschstat/research/pubs/advancing-diversity-inclusion.pdffor the purposes of this funding opportunity announcement, only individuals from categories a and b are eligible to apply for support under this program.this foa does not require cost sharing as defined in the nih grants policy statement.applicant organizations may submit more than one application, provided that each application is scientifically distinct, and each is from a different candidate.the nih will not accept duplicate or highly overlapping applications under review at the same time. an individual may not have two or more competing nih career development applications pending review concurrently. in addition, nih will not accept:candidates may submit research project grant (rpg) applications concurrently with the k application. however, any concurrent rpg application may not have substantial scientific and/or budgetary overlap with the career award application. k award recipients are encouraged to obtain funding from nih or other federal sources either as a pd/pi on a competing research grant award or cooperative agreement, or as project leader on a competing multi-project award as described in not-od-08-065.at the time of award, the candidate must have a “full-time” appointment at the applicant institution. candidates are required to commit a minimum of nine person months of effort (i.e., 75% of full-time professional effort) to their program of career development. candidates may engage in other duties as part of the professional effort not covered by this award, as long as such duties do not interfere with or detract from the proposed career development program.candidates who have va appointments may not consider part of the va effort toward satisfying the full time requirement at the applicant institution. candidates with va appointments should contact the staff person in the relevant institute or center prior to preparing an application to discuss their eligibility.after the receipt of the award, adjustments to the required level of effort may be made in certain circumstances. see not-od-09-036 for more details.before submitting the application, the candidate must identify a mentor who will supervise the proposed career development and research experience. the mentor should be an active investigator in the area of the proposed research and be committed both to the career development of the candidate and to the direct supervision of the candidate's research. the mentor must document the availability of sufficient research support and facilities for high-quality research. candidates are encouraged to identify more than one mentor, i.e., a mentoring team (or advisory committee), if this is deemed advantageous for providing expert advice in all aspects of the research career development program. in such cases, one individual must be identified as the primary mentor who will coordinate the candidate's research. the candidate must work with the mentor(s) in preparing the application. the mentor, or a member of the mentoring team, should have a successful track record of mentoring individuals at the candidate's career stage. where feasible, women, individuals from underrepresented racial and ethnic groups, and individuals with disabilities should be involved as mentors to serve as role models.the mentor(s) or mentoring team must demonstrate appropriate expertise, experience, and ability to guide the candidate in the organization, management and implementation of the proposed research and clinical trial.institutional environmentthe applicant institution must have a strong, well-established record of research and
