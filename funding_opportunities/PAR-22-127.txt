cancer institute (nci)r01 research project grantsee notices of special interest associated with this funding opportunitysee section iii. 3. additional information on eligibility.this funding opportunity announcement (foa) supports projects relevant to the nigms mission or those of other nih institutes or centers (ics) participating in the foa that focus solely on the development of technologies with the potential to enable acquisition of biomedical knowledge. projects should be justified in terms of technical innovation and utility of such technical innovation for impacting future biomedical research. outcomes or products of the proposed project should significantly advance the current state of the art and be sufficiently characterized for application in addressing a broad range of biomedical research questions. these outcomes may include, but are not limited to:the goal of this foa is to support the development of technologies with demonstrated proof-of-concept that have remaining significant technical challenges to full implementation and broad utility. as such, applications should not propose to test specific biological questions. applications proposing to test specific biological questions are not responsive to this foa and will be administratively withdrawn without review. applications with a focus on optimization, hardening, or obvious extrapolations of established technology will be a lower priority for funding.not applicableall applications are due by 5:00 pm local time of applicant organization.applicants are encouraged to apply early to allow adequate time to make any corrections to errors found in the application during the submission process by the due date.not applicableit is critical that applicants follow the instructions in the research (r) instructions in the sf424 (r&r) application guide, except where instructed to do otherwise (in this foa or in a notice from nih guide for grants and contracts).conformance to all requirements (both in the application guide and the foa) is required and strictly enforced. applicants must read and follow all application instructions in the application guide as well as any program-specific instructions noted in section iv. when the program-specific instructions deviate from those in the application guide, follow the program-specific instructions.applications that do not comply with these instructions may be delayed or not accepted for review.there are several options available to submit your application through grants.gov to nih and department of health and human services partners. you must use one of these submission options to access the application forms for this opportunity.support for early-stage technology development is critical to advance biomedical researchtechnological advances are crucial for accelerating biomedical research. technology enables science by providing novel ways to address questions, and more importantly, by allowing researchers to pose new questions that could not be anticipated in the absence of the enabling technology. new knowledge drives the imperative for new tools, and those tools open new questions, in a mutually reinforcing positive feedback loop that drives science forward. this foa invites research applications with a focus on early stage technology development and validation before the technologies are ready for application to untested biological questions and wide dissemination. early technology development can be described in two stages: (i) exploratory proof-of-concept research to determine the feasibility and best approach(es) for a technology development project, and (ii) the subsequent research and development that focuses exclusively on creating and validating a working prototype technology before application to untested biomedical questions is possible. this foa invites projects in stage ii research and development of a working prototype. a companion foa, par-22-126 "technology development research for establishing feasibility and proof of concept (r21 clinical trial not allowed)" supports projects in stage i (evaluation of an untested concept). applications that include technology development projects to address specific biological questions are not responsive to the goals of this foa but may be submitted through the parent r01 funding announcement or other foas (e.g., nigms' maximizing investigators' research awards).applications to this foa should propose development of technologies that are already supported by proof-of-concept and preliminary data. the project focus should be on advancing the technology to a stage that demonstrates its potential for broad utility in biomedical research.for this foa, technology refers to tools, methods and techniques that enable a broad spectrum of biomedical research that falls within the nigms mission or those of the other ics participating in this foa including, but not limited to:further, this foa calls for innovative, focused technology development predicated on a broad need or challenge in biomedical research that is beyond the current technological capability. the state-of-the-art technological performance defines a measurable starting point. comparison of the proposed improvement in technical performance to the state of the art provides the rationale for developing a fundamentally different technology. specific well-characterized test systems may be used for validation, but applications should highlight the broad utility of the technology for biomedical research. applications that include investigation of specific biological questions in the time frame of the proposed project are considered nonresponsive to this foa and will be administratively withdrawn without review.responsiveness criteriaworking prototypes: the proposed project objective should be development of a working prototype for a technology that, while supported by preliminary data demonstrating proof of principle, still has significant fundamental technical challenges. these challenges should be substantial enough to require focused effort over a three-to-nine-year period. since this foa is designed for highly innovative concepts, the prototype should represent a significant advance over the state of the art. projects supported by this program should not be incremental improvements to established technologies.validation: applications of the technology in the project period should be limited to test systems chosen to facilitate development. the aims of the project should be focused entirely on the development of the technology. the products of this research will be functioning prototype instruments, methods, synthetic approaches, etc., adequately characterized to be ready for first application to the type of biomedical research questions that provided the rationale for their development.non-responsiveness criteriabiological questions: applications that include aims that address specific biological questions are not responsive to the goals of this foa and will be administratively withdrawn without review. however, validation of a technology against known standards is encouraged. although biomedical relevance is an essential element of nih research, this stage of technology development should not include immediate short-term application of nascent technologies to challenging biomedical research questions.relevance of research topics for this foaprospective applicants are strongly advised to consult with the relevent scientific/research contact(s) listed in this foa for guidance on assessing the application's relevance for this foa. final determination of application eligibility for this foa will be based on nih staff assessment of the full application after submission. applications that are determined to be non-responsive to this foa, or that propose research topics that are not appropriate for the participating nih institutes, will be administratively withdrawn.participating nih institute missionsnigms: the mission of nigms is to support basic research that increases our understanding of biological processes and lays the foundation for future advances in disease diagnosis, treatment, and prevention. nigms-funded scientists investigate how living systems work at a range of levels - from molecules and cells to tissues and organs - in research organisms, humans, and populations. the institute’s research mission is aimed at understanding the principles, mechanisms, and processes that underlie living organisms, often using research models. nigms also supports the development of fundamental methods and new technologies to achieve its mission. supported research may utilize specific cells or organ systems if they serve as models for understanding general principles.nigms supports:nigms does not support:prospective applicants are encouraged to visit nigms technology development programs (r21 and r01) for more details.nia:the mission of nia is conducting and supporting research on aging and the health and well-being of older people. nia supports technologies which will increase the understanding of the nature of aging and the aging process, and diseases and conditions associated with growing older, in order to extend the healthy, active years of life.nci: the mission of nci is to lead, conduct, and support cancer research across the nation to advance scientific knowledge and help all people live longer, healthier lives. nci is interested in technology development projects which can ultimately enable novel and improved cancer diagnostic capabilities and treatment strategies. examples of focused research areas include, but are not limited to:note: applications that propose technology development with the following characteristics will be of low funding priority:see section viii. other information for award authorities and regulations.grant: a support mechanism providing money, property, or both to an eligible entity to carry out an approved project or activity.the oer glossary and the sf424 (r&r) application guide provide details on these application types. only those application types listed here are allowed for this foa.not allowed: only accepting applications that do not propose clinical trials.need help determining whether you are doing a clinical trial?the number of awards is contingent upon nih appropriations and the submission of a sufficient number of meritorious applications.application budgets are not limited but must reflect the actual needs of the proposed project. applications proposing projects that have early feasibility data but significant risk due to their early stage of development may request reduced budgets or a reduced duration in their applications. applications proposing projects that are well supported by feasibility studies and are ready to develop into fully functional prototypes might require higher budgets for up to a four-year duration (five years for early- stage- investigators).the scope of the proposed project should determine the project period. the maximum project period is 5 years, although investigators supported by nigms who are not esis will generally receive no more than four years of support in a project period. the grant may be renewed only one time.nih grants policies as described in the nih

direct costs requested for any one year, must address a data management and sharing plan.all instructions in the sf424 (r&r) application guide must be followed, with the following additional instructions:specific aims: specific aims should propose to advance the technical knowledge required to investigate or manipulate biological systems in the service of furthering basic biomedical research that is supported by the participating nih institutes. technical advances should be novel, inventive entities or methods that have future utility to broadly advance biomedical research. examples would include instruments, devices, processes, algorithms, software, chemicals, biomolecules, or cells that have potential value for enabling new biomedical research.research strategy:significancein addition to the topics outlined in the sf424 (r&r) application guide, explain the potential impact of the technology for biomedical research. describe the rationale for the proposed technology development and incorporate discussion of the broad opportunity or need that the new technology will address.innovationin addition to the topics outlined in the sf424 (r&r) application guide, outline the unique nature of the technical opportunity that will be exploited in the project. the technology concept should be novel, inventive entities or methods with potential broad utility for biomedical research. innovation could be evaluated by the amount of technical advance over the state of the art and/or the potential advance enabled in current biomedical research or approaches.approachin addition to the topics outlined in the sf424 (r&r) application guide, describe those aspects of the experimental approach that are specific to focused technology development. these include the uncertainties underlying the proposed technology research and development, including the risk of failure.design the approach to establish a working prototype with substantially

standard biological samples is encouraged.objectives and milestones: describe the desired characteristics of the technology at the conclusion of the project as end-point objectives, and present intermediate milestones towards that goal. the milestones and objectives are measurable project performance criteria that, if achieved, would provide a significant technical advance over the state of the art. describe how experimental results from this project will provide an adequate foundation for the next phase of development efforts, such as a future r01 project or equivalent. for focused research, risk is expected and milestones might not be reached on a predictable timetable. nonetheless, define measurable milestones and state whether intermediate or end point project performance would be adequate for working prototypes to have utility for addressing novel biological questions. describe the desired performance characteristics of the proposed technology and specific measures that will be used to evaluate progress toward achieving those goals. limit the technology application to test systems and explain the rationale for the choice of test systems in terms of the desired technology performance and how a test system will facilitate the technology development.resource sharing plan: individuals are required to comply with the instructions for the resource sharing plans

plan will not be evaluated at time of review.only the review criteria described below will be considered in the review process. applications submitted to the nih in support of the nih mission are evaluated for scientific and technical merit through the nih peer review system.for this particular announcement, note the following:the intent of this foa is to support high risk projects that are not ready for testing biological hypotheses. as such, the objectives should not address untested biological questions or gain new biological knowledge. applications should be innovative, include measurable end-point objectives and intermediate milestones, and describe risk management. preliminary data, theoretical evaluation, alternative approaches, and well-described criteria for success and failure can mitigate risk. projects appropriate for a four- or five-year r01 should include evidence that the outcome is feasible. the r01 objectives should include functioning prototypes or evaluation of working technology that may not be as efficient, robust, or versatile as the final version, but should demonstrate utility to resolve a significant biomedical problem. the specific aims should include validation of technology against known standards such as synthetic models and characterized, gold-standard, biological systems. projects that are at an intermediate stage, with incomplete preliminary data, but with substantial remaining risk, may request reduced budgets or a shorter project duration.overall impactreviewers will provide an overall impact score to reflect their assessment of the likelihood for the project to exert a sustained, powerful influence on the research field(s) involved, in consideration of the following review criteria and additional review criteria (as applicable for the project proposed).scored review criteriareviewers will consider each of the review criteria below in the determination of scientific merit, and give a separate score for each. an application does not need to be strong in all categories to be judged likely to have major scientific impact. for example, a project that by its nature is not innovative may be essential to advance a field.significancedoes the project address an important problem or a critical barrier to progress in the field? is the prior research that serves as the key support for the proposed project rigorous? if the aims of the project are achieved, how will scientific knowledge, technical capability, and/or clinical practice be improved? how will successful completion of the aims change the concepts, methods, technologies, treatments, services, or preventative interventions that drive this field?specific to this foa: does the proposed technology development have the potential to address an important unmet need in biomedical research or open considerable new avenues for investigation? does the technology overcome the limitations of the current state of the art? is the potential effect of the technology on biomedical research appropriately broad? regardless of the inherent risk of the project, assuming that continued development of the technology is successful, would its availability enable new research or appreciably facilitate current research? is the technology likely to have a practical utility for the research community?investigator(s)are the pd(s)/pi(s), collaborators, and other researchers well suited to the project? if early stage investigators or those in the early stages of independent careers, do they have appropriate experience and training? if established, have they demonstrated an ongoing record of accomplishments that have advanced their field(s)? if the project is collaborative or multi-pd/pi, do the investigators have complementary and integrated expertise; are their leadership approach, governance and organizational structure appropriate for the project?innovationdoes the application challenge and seek to shift current research or clinical practice paradigms by utilizing novel theoretical concepts, approaches or methodologies, instrumentation, or interventions? are the concepts, approaches or methodologies, instrumentation, or interventions novel to one field of research or novel in a broad sense? is a refinement, improvement, or new application of theoretical concepts, approaches or methodologies, instrumentation, or interventions proposed?specific to this foa: does the proposed research test an innovative concept for development of an unproven technology? is the proposed technology fundamentally new? if it is not new, does it solve a longstanding technical problem in an established technology area? does the project involve an appropriately high level of uncertainty or risk? is the potential impact commensurate with the level of risk?approachare the overall strategy, methodology, and analyses well-reasoned and appropriate to accomplish the specific aims of the project? have the investigators included plans to address weaknesses in the rigor of prior research that serves as the key support for the proposed project? have the investigators presented strategies to ensure a robust and unbiased approach, as appropriate for the work proposed? are potential problems, alternative strategies, and benchmarks for success presented? if the project is in the early stages of development, will the strategy establish feasibility and will particularly risky aspects be managed? have the investigators presented adequate plans to address relevant biological variables, such as sex, for studies in vertebrate animals or human subjects?if the project involves human subjects and/or nih-defined clinical research, are the plans to address 1) the protection of human subjects from research risks, and 2) inclusion (or exclusion) of individuals on the basis of sex/gender, race, and ethnicity, as well as the inclusion or exclusion of individuals of all ages (including children and older adults), justified in terms of the scientific goals and research strategy proposed?specific to this foa: upon its completion, will the project establish the readiness of the proposed technology for subsequent application to biomedical research problems? will the project objectives lead to a working prototype of the technology? if projects are at an intermediate stage with insufficient feasibility studies, is the approach for rapidly evaluating feasibility of the proposed technology reasonable? will the data collection and analysis process enable quantitative assessment of the project outcomes and milestones? does the research plan adequately address technical challenges?are intermediate and end-point objectives or milestones well defined? would experimental results from this project provide an adequate foundation for the next phase of development efforts, such as a future r01 project or equivalent?environmentwill the scientific environment in which the work will be done contribute to the probability of success? are the institutional support, equipment and other physical resources available to the investigators adequate for the project proposed? will the project benefit from unique features of the scientific environment, subject populations, or collaborative arrangements?additional review criteriaas applicable for the project proposed, reviewers will evaluate the following additional items while determining scientific and technical merit, and in providing an overall impact score, but will not give separate scores for these items.protections for human subjectsfor research that involves human subjects but does not involve one of the categories of research that are exempt under 45 cfr part 46, the committee will evaluate the justification for involvement of human subjects and the proposed protections from research risk relating to their participation according to the following five review criteria: 1) risk to subjects, 2) adequacy of protection against risks, 3) potential benefits to the subjects and others, 4) importance of the knowledge to be gained, and 5) data and safety monitoring for clinical trials.for research that involves human subjects and meets the criteria for one or more of the categories of research that are exempt under 45 cfr part 46, the committee will evaluate: 1) the justification for the exemption, 2) human subjects involvement and characteristics, and 3) sources of materials. for additional information on review of the human subjects section, please refer to the guidelines for the review of human subjects.inclusion of women, minorities, and individuals across the lifespanwhen the proposed project involves human subjects and/or nih-defined clinical research, the committee will evaluate the proposed plans for the inclusion (or exclusion) of individuals on the basis of sex/gender, race, and ethnicity, as well as the inclusion (or exclusion) of individuals of all ages (including children and older adults) to determine if it is justified in terms of the scientific goals and research strategy proposed. for additional information on review of the inclusion section, please refer to the guidelines for the review of inclusion in clinical research.vertebrate animalsthe committee will evaluate the involvement of live vertebrate animals as part of the scientific assessment according to the following criteria: (1) description of proposed procedures involving animals, including species, strains, ages, sex, and total number to be used; (2) justifications for the use of animals versus alternative models and for the appropriateness of the species proposed; (3) interventions to minimize discomfort, distress, pain and injury; and (4) justification for euthanasia method if not consistent with the avma guidelines for the euthanasia of animals. reviewers will assess the use of chimpanzees as they would any other application proposing the use of vertebrate animals. for

principal investigator’s scientific interest, funding limitations, recruitment requirements, and other considerations. thus, criteria in research protocols that target or exclude certain populations are warranted where nondiscriminatory justifications establish that such criteria are appropriate with respect to the health or safety of the subjects, the scientific study design, or the purpose of the research. for additional guidance regarding how the provisions apply to nih grant programs, please contact the scientific/research contact that is identified in section vii under agency contacts
