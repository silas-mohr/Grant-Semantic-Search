application forms for this opportunity.backgroundin 2017, nearly one-half of americans infected with hiv were over the age of 50, and approximately a third were over the age of 55. the proportion of older adults with hiv is expected to continue to rise, primarily because of the successes of modern antiretroviral therapy that has allowed individuals infected at a younger age to survive into older age. prevalence of hiv infection in older age is also attributable to new infections in later life, with approximately 17% of new diagnoses in americans occurring in adults age 50 and older.in contrast to the pre-modern era of hiv treatment, where aids-related opportunistic infections and cancers were common, currently the most frequent morbidities and causes of death for individuals undergoing treatment for hiv infection are similar to those seen in older non-infected adults. these conditions include cardiovascular disease, lung disease, infection-related and non-infection-related cancers, neurocognitive and neuropsychiatric disorders, osteopenia/osteoporosis, liver cirrhosis, and renal disease. in addition, individuals living with hiv infection may exhibit many of the clinical and socio-behavioral characteristics commonly observed in aging, such as multiple morbidities, polypharmacy, declining physical and cognitive function, alterations in body composition, social isolation, and increasing caregiver burden. people living with hiv also exhibit molecular changes associated with aging such as epigenetic alterations, mitochondrial impairment, and telomere shortening. thus, accumulating evidence suggests that hiv and/or its treatment may lead, at least in part, to an accelerated aging phenotype. in addition, recent advances have led to greater adoption of pre- and post-exposure prophylaxis, but the impact of these measures on aging are unclear.scopethis foa encourages applications at the intersection of hiv and aging by addressing two overarching objectives: 1) to improve understanding of biological, clinical, and socio-behavioral aspects of aging through the lens of hiv infection and its treatment; and 2) to improve approaches for testing, prevention, and treatment of hiv infection, and management of hiv-related comorbidities, co-infections, and complications in different populations and cultural settings by applying our current understanding of aging science. applications appropriate to this foa should be consistent with the scientific priorities outlined by the nih office of aids research (oar) as described in not-od-20-018.this foa encourages applications with the following characteristics:interests of specific institutes/centersthe scientific interests of participating institutes and centers (ics) are summarized below. applicants are encouraged to contact the scientific/research contact of the intended ic to ensure that the aims of the proposed project are consistent with ic mission and oar's scientific priorities.national institute on aging (nia)nia is interested in understanding how biological, clinical, and socio-behavioral processes affect older individuals with hiv and their caregivers, and the social, economic, and health consequences of hiv. example topics include the following:national institute of arthritis and musculoskeletal and skin diseases (niams)niams encourages observational, biopsychosocial/behavioral, translational, basic/pre-clinical/clinical research, and mechanistic clinical trials focused on how the process of aging in the presence or treatment of hiv/aids impacts diseases within the niams core mission, which are more common among the aging population (e.g. rheumatologic disorders, bone fractures, osteoporosis, osteoarthritis). niams encourages interdisciplinary research aimed at elucidating factors that may drive the aging population living with hiv/aids to develop niams mission-related diseases and understanding how the interplay between aging and hiv/aids may promote the acceleration or worsening of these diseases.niams will not accept applications submitted in response to these foas that include a clinical trial in which the primary objective is to test a clinical outcome. a clinical trial outcome is a study designed with the objective of evaluating the safety, tolerability, efficacy, and/or effectiveness of pharmacological, behavioral, biological, surgical, or device (invasive or non-invasive) interventions. for such non-mechanistic clinical trials, niams will accept u01 clinical trial applications through par-18-594 and its re-issues or r21 clinical trial applications through par-18-595 and its re-issues.consultation with niams staff is strongly recommended for investigators planning a clinical trial with a mechanistic outcome. if niams determines after submission that a clinical outcome is a primary objective of the study, niams will not accept the application.national institute of dental and craniofacial research (nidcr) nidcr is interested in research that investigates the effects of hiv infection and treatment on dental, oral soft and hard tissues, and salivary glands. specifically, changes in these tissues with relation to aging adults and premature aging of oral tissues in chronic and acute hiv infections are of high priority. nidcr does not support clinical trials through this foa. studies may include, but are not limited to:national institute of diabetes and digestive and kidney diseases (niddk)niddk encourages projects aimed at elucidating effects of aging on hiv-related comorbidities, coinfections, and complications within its mission. effects of interest include changes in biological, pathophysiological, environmental, psychological, behavioral, and social processes. comorbidities, coinfections, and complications of interest include gastrointestinal immune and microbial homeostasis, enteropathy, noncommunicable liver and biliary diseases, viral hepatitis, nutritional inadequacies, obesity, metabolic/endocrine dysfunction and perturbations, kidney disease, benign genitourinary diseases and disorders, and hematologic sequelae. niddk also encourages projects that interrogate the impact of aging processes on hiv reservoirs within its mission, including the gastrointestinal mucosa, adipose tissue, the kidney, and the male genital tract.national institute of mental health (nimh)nimh's overarching angle in hiv and aging is interdisciplinary, conceptually grounded hiv research studies in behavioral/clinical science research and basic/clinical neuroscience research of older adults.major nimh/dar research program themes in hiv and aging:national institute of neurological disorders and stroke (ninds)ninds is interested in fostering innovative basic, translational, and clinical research on the effects of chronic hiv infection, co-morbidities, and aging on the central nervous system (cns). research to define and elucidate novel mechanisms of pathogenesis that are driving neurocognitive decline at the intersection of hiv-associated neurodegenerative processes, aging-associated cns diseases, chronic antiretroviral treatment effects, and host susceptibility factors are highly encouraged. areas of research interest include, but are not limited to, the following:ninds will only support clinical trial applications under this foa that propose human mechanistic trials/studies that meet nih's definition of a clinical trial and that fall within the ninds research priorities.national cancer institute (nci)nci, as a participating institute, seeks to foster research studies to help understand how aging in the presence of chronic hiv infection affects the risk, spectrum, and biology of cancer (aids-defining and non-aids-defining cancers). recent data indicate an increase in non-aids-defining cancers, which is driven to a large extent by the growth and aging of the hiv/aids population. aging is, by itself, a key factor promoting the development of many cancers, and hiv infection can itself cause certain manifestations of premature aging. there is a lack of data on the interplay between aging, hiv, long-term exposure to antiretroviral drugs, and other factors promoting cancer development in the aging population. in addition, there is little understanding of the interplay between host factors and immune perturbations that occur in aging and how these interactions affect cancers that are mostly seen in older people (e.g., kaposi’s sarcoma and merkel cell carcinoma).non-responsiveness criteriaapplications that are not aligned with oar priority areas as described in not-od-20-018 will be considered non-responsive. applications not responsive to this foa
