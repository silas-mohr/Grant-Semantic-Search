june 8, 2022eunice kennedy shriver national institute of child health and human development (nichd)the last decade has seen an explosion of new technologies aimed at assessing and improving health. examples include wearable devices, communication aids, robotics and e-textiles, just to name a few. during this period, there have also been enormous advances in technologies that were not created for health-related purposes, but that have potential applicability to health assessments and interventions, including mobile device applications (“apps”) and social media platforms.however, most of these technologies were originally developed for use in adults with typical cognitive and motor function. as a result, there is currently a relative paucity of valid and reliable technological tools for individuals with intellectual, developmental (idd) and physical disabilities.this notice therefore invites small business applications specifically aimed at developing or building upon existing technological tools to improve assessments, interventions, and outcomes for children and individuals with intellectual, developmental and physical disabilities.scope of supportapplications responsive to this notice will address tools and/or technologies and target populations of interest. proposals must address one or more target populations of interest:applications proposing tools and/or technologies may include, but are not limited to, home monitors, point-of-care diagnostic technologies, mobile devices, mobile device apps (including social media apps), and wearable sensors and monitors. they may also include tools that help share information between caregivers, or between families and clinicians, including tools that interface with electronic health record (ehr) platforms. these tools and/or technologies may enhance access to information or promote accessibility for marginalized or underrepresented groups with idds.technological areas of interest include, but are not limited to:some specific examples of tools and technologies that could be applied to individuals with idd include, but are not limited to, the following:application and submission informationsubmit applications for this initiative using one of the following funding opportunity announcements (foas) or any reissues of these announcement through the expiration date of this notice.all instructions in the sf424 (r&r) application guide and the funding opportunity announcement used for submission must be followed, with the following additions:applications nonresponsive to terms of this nosi will not be considered for the nosi initiative.applications nonresponsive to terms of this nosi will not be considered for the nosi initiative.scientific/research contact(s)sujata bardhan, phd eunice kennedy shriver national institute of child health and human development (nichd) telephone: 301-435-0471 email: sujata.bardhan@nih.govweekly toc for this announcement nih funding opportunities and noticesnote: for help accessing pdf, rtf, ms word, excel, powerpoint, audio or video files, see help downloading files.
