opportunity.rationalethe healthcare landscape in the united states and globally is constantly changing, creating new challenges to the delivery of high-quality treatments and services to children, youth, adults, and older adults with unmet or under-met mental health needs. epidemiological findings suggest that approximately one half of the united states population meets lifetime criteria for a mental disorder, and approximately one fifth of people over 18-years-old meet criteria in any given year. however, only one half of people with any mental health disorders and only two thirds of adults with a serious mental health disorder received mental health services in the previous year. among young adults with serious mental illness, approximately half received mental health services in the previous year. of those that find their way into mental health care, many quickly fall out of care and/or do not receive guideline-concordant treatment. statistics for low- and middle-income countries (lmics) show even lower rates of treatment. health disparities among certain populations (e.g., members of racial, ethnic, sexual and gender minority communities), a fragmented healthcare system, provider shortages, healthcare affordability, and other factors moderate these findings. innovative mental health services research is needed to improve access, continuity, quality, equity, efficiency, and value of mental health services, and to bring effective strategies to scale to maximize public health impact.research scope and opportunitiesthis program announcement uses the r34 mechanism and is intended to foster pilot mental health services research in strategic but understudied areas where new knowledge has the potential for high public heath impact. this announcement supports non-clinical trials research, including quasi-experimental studies, survey or qualitative research methods, clinical epidemiology, and development and evaluation of new research methods, measures, financing approaches, or statistical approaches related to mental health services research. services research can target patients, providers, healthcare leaders and administrators, and/or healthcare systems or other organizations that provide services to persons with mental disorders, including those with early psychosis or autism spectrum disorders across the lifespan. nimh encourages investigators to design their applications to maximize the likelihood that findings will meaningfully inform future research and/or be translated rapidly into practice, whether at the patient, clinical, healthcare/other system, or policy level. studies involving providers, technologies, and workflows that generate results which can inform future studies of implementation in routine care settings are encouraged.applications proposing definitive studies consistent with nimh priorities for mental health services research not involving interventions should be submitted via par-23-095, innovative mental health services research not involving clinical trials (r01 clinical trials not allowed).nimh encourages investigators to develop and leverage strong research-practice partnerships with public and private stakeholders, so that the research follows a deployment-focused model of services design and testing. deployment-focused studies take into account the perspective of relevant stakeholders and key characteristics of settings intended to implement optimized mental health interventions. this attention to end-user perspectives and characteristics of intended clinical and/or community practice settings is intended to ensure that resultant interventions and service delivery strategies are feasible and scalable, and to ensure that the research results will have utility for end users. such stakeholders include, but are not limited to, federal agencies (e.g., centers for medicare and medicaid services, substance abuse and mental health services administration, health resources and services administration, u.s. department of defense, department of veterans affairs); state agencies, including state medicaid leadership; commercial health insurers/funders; public and commercial disability insurers; employers and other payers; delivery systems; professional/trade associations; accrediting and licensing organizations; medical education and other clinician training programs; clinicians; vendors of information technology and other relevant products/services; service users; family members; and community organizations or comparable institutions and stakeholders in lmics. such communication and collaboration will ensure findings are relevant and practical, create opportunities for research that is not otherwise feasible, and enable stakeholders to anticipate relevant research initiatives in their planning and activities.given the critical need for practice-relevant research in community and practice settings, collaborations between academic investigators and clinical or community practice partners or networks are encouraged. when possible, studies should capitalize on existing infrastructure (e.g., practice-based research networks such as the nimh-sponsored mental health research network (mhrn) and the early psychosis intervention network (epinet); nimh-sponsored alacrity research centers; nimh-sponsored scale-up hubs; electronic medical records, administrative databases, patient registries, institutions with clinical and translational science awards) to increase the efficiency of participant recruitment, data collection and management.nimh is committed to supporting research that reduces disparities and advances equity in mental health interventions, services, and outcomes. accordingly, this foa encourages pilot research on innovative service delivery models that seek to reduce disparities in service access, quality, and outcomes for racial and ethnic minority groups, individuals limited by language or cultural barriers, sexual and gender minorities, individuals living in rural areas, socioeconomically disadvantaged persons and other underserved groups.under this foa, nimh seeks pilot mental health services research applications that align with goal 4 of the nimh strategic plan. examples of high priority research include, but are not limited to, the following.research improving the efficiency, reach, and clinical impact of existing mental health services:research that informs the expeditious adoption, scaling, sustained implementation, and continuous quality improvement of evidence-based mental health or autism services as part of a learning healthcare system:research on innovative service delivery models to reduce or eliminate known health disparities related to race, ethnicity, geography, sexual and gender minority status and/or socioeconomic status, to dramatically improve outcomes in understudied populations in diverse united states and global communities, and to ensure high value mental health services are readily accessible to those in need:research to evaluate the public health impact of mental health services or autism services innovation using large representative data sets and novel computational approaches:applications not responsive to this foathe following are projects that will be considered non-responsive and will not be reviewed:applications submitted in response to the current funding opportunity announcement (foa) may not include a clinical trial within the aims; such applications submitted to this foa will be withdrawn before review. mental health services research questions that require a clinical trial design must be submitted via the appropriate nimh clinical trials funding opportunity announcement (see support for clinical trials at nimh). applicants considering research studies where participants are prospectively assigned to one or more interventions to evaluate the effects of those interventions on health-related outcomes are encouraged to review the nimh clinical trials website and contact nimh program officials regarding the match between a potential application and current priorities.the nimh has published updated policies and guidance for investigators regarding human research protection and clinical research data and safety monitoring (not-mh-19-027). the application's phs human subjects and clinical trials information, including the data and safety monitoring plan, should reflect the policies and guidance in this notice. plans for the protection of research participants and data and safety monitoring will be reviewed by the nimh for consistency with nimh and nih policies and federal regulations.see section viii. other information for award authorities and regulations.grant: a support mechanism

be followed, with the following additional instructions:to advance the goal of advancing research through widespread data sharing among researchers, investigators funded under this foa are expected to share those data via the national institute of mental health data archive (nda; see not-mh-19-033). established by the nih, nda is a secure informatics platform for scientific collaboration and data sharing that enables the effective communication of detailed research data, tools, and supporting documentation. nda links data across research projects through its global unique identifier (guid) and data dictionary technology. investigators funded under this foa are expected to use these technologies to submit data to the nda.to accomplish this objective, it will be important to formulate a) an enrollment strategy that will obtain the information necessary to generate a guid for each participant and b) a budget strategy that will cover the costs of data submission. the nda website provides two tools to help investigators develop appropriate strategies: 1) the nda data submission cost model which offers a customizable excel worksheet that includes tasks and hours for the program director/principal investigator and data manager to budget for data sharing; and 2) plain language text to be considered in your informed consent available from the nda's data contribution page. investigators are expected to certify the quality of all data generated by grants funded under this foa prior to submission to nda and review their data for accuracy after submission. submission of descriptive/raw data is expected semi-annually (every january 15 and july 15); submission of all other data is expected at the time of publication or prior to the end of the grant, whichever occurs first (see nda sharing regimen for more information). investigators are expected to share results, positive and negative, specific to the cohorts and outcome measures studied. the nda dating sharing plan is available for review on the nda website. nda staff will work with investigators to help them submit data types not yet defined in the nda data dictionary.only limited appendix materials are allowed. follow all instructions for the appendix as described in the sf424 (r&r) application guide.when involving human subjects research, clinical research, and/or nih-defined clinical trials (and

commons and for the system for award management. additional information may be found in the sf424 (r&r) application guide.see more tips for avoiding common errors.upon receipt, applications will be evaluated for completeness and compliance with application instructions by the center for scientific review and responsiveness by components of participating organizations, nih. applications that are incomplete, non-compliant and/or nonresponsive will not be reviewed.use of common data elements in nih-funded researchmany nih ics encourages the use of common data elements (cdes) in basic, clinical, and applied research, patient registries, and other human subject research to facilitate broader and more effective use of data and advance research across studies. cdes are data elements that have been identified and defined for use in multiple data sets across different studies. use of cdes can facilitate data sharing and standardization to improve data quality and enable data integration from multiple studies and sources, including electronic health records. nih ics have identified cdes for many clinical domains (e.g., neurological disease), types of studies (e.g. genome-wide association studies (gwas)), types of outcomes (e.g., patient-reported outcomes), and patient registries (e.g., the global rare diseases patient registry and data repository). nih has established a “common data element (cde) resource portal" (http://cde.nih.gov/) to assist investigators in identifying nih-supported cdes when developing protocols, case report forms, and other instruments for data collection. the portal provides guidance about and access to nih-supported cde initiatives and other tools and resources for the appropriate use of cdes and data standards in nih-funded research. investigators are encouraged to consult the portal and describe in their applications any use they will make of nih-supported cdes in their projects.nimh has released expectations for collecting common data elements when an application involves human research participants. details can be found at not-mh-20-067 and the nimh webpage on data sharing for applicants and awardees.for projects that are considered clinical research, include patient measures that adhere to nimh's expectation on the collection of common data elements efforts per not-mh-20-067. if the expected common data elements will not be collected, provide a rationale that justifies the decision to not include those common data elements.applicants are required to follow the instructions for post-submission materials, as described in the policy1. criteriaonly the review criteria described below will be considered in the review process. applications submitted to the nih in support of the nih mission are evaluated for scientific and technical merit through the nih peer review system.note: effective for due dates on or after january 25, 2023, the data sharing plan and genomic data sharing plan (gds) will not be evaluated at time of review.for this particular announcement, note the following:this nimh r34 foa supports pilot research consistent with nimh priorities for services research studies that are not immediate precursors to the development and testing of services interventions. because this foa supports exploratory/developmental research, applications need not have extensive background material or preliminary information as one might normally expect in an r01 application. preliminary data are not required for r34 applications but may be included if available. adequate justification for the proposed work can be provided through literature citations, data from other sources, or, when available, investigator-generated data. therefore, reviewers will focus their evaluation on the conceptual framework, the level of innovation, and the potential to significantly advance scientific knowledge or understanding related to mental health services.overall impactreviewers will provide an overall impact score to reflect their assessment of the likelihood for the project to exert a sustained, powerful influence on the research field(s) involved, in consideration of the following review criteria and additional review criteria (as applicable for the project proposed).scored review criteriareviewers will consider each of the review criteria below in the determination of scientific merit and give a separate score for each. an application does not need to be strong in all categories to be judged likely to have major scientific impact. for example, a project that by its nature is not innovative may be essential to advance a field.significancedoes the project address an important problem or a critical barrier to progress in the field? is the prior research that serves as the key support for the proposed project rigorous? if the aims of the project are achieved, how will scientific knowledge, technical capability, and/or clinical practice be improved? how will successful completion of the aims change the concepts, methods, technologies, treatments, services, or preventative interventions that drive this field?how likely is it that the proposed pilot research will generate data that will lead to a firm conclusion about the feasibility of a regular research project grant (e.g., an r01 application)?for projects involving methods development and testing, what is the potential for broad use of results in studies of other target populations and/or outcomes?how adequate are the collaborations and/or input from community partners and relevant policy makers/health leaders for ensuring that the research is deployment-focused and/or the results will have utility to stakeholders? does the application appropriately discuss how information gleaned from these

results will have utility to community practice and/or other relevant stakeholders or end users of the research?what are the potential public health implicationsof the proposed work in terms of 1) reach and effect on the target population and/or 2) meaningfulness of the anticipated outcome(s) compared to existing approaches and/or current state of science in the topic area?for studies involving services interventions that employ quasi-experimental or quality improvement designs and methodologies, how well does the application address the potential scalability and implementation of the proposed intervention using typically available resources, staff, and service structures, including financing structures?investigator(s)are the pd(s)/pi(s), collaborators, and other researchers well suited to the project? if early stage investigators or those in the early stages of independent careers, do they have appropriate experience and training? if established, have they demonstrated an ongoing record of accomplishments that have advanced their field(s)? if the project is collaborative or multi-pd/pi, do the investigators have complementary and integrated expertise; are their leadership approach, governance, and organizational structure appropriate for the project?innovationdoes the application challenge and seek to shift current research or clinical practice paradigms by utilizing novel theoretical concepts, approaches or methodologies, instrumentation, or interventions? are the concepts, approaches or methodologies, instrumentation, or interventions novel to one field of research or novel in a broad sense? is a refinement, improvement, or new application of theoretical concepts, approaches or methodologies, instrumentation, or interventions proposed?are the research strategies and design or analytic elements being used innovative? does the innovation enhance the relevance and usefulness of study findings?does the application sufficiently describe how the use of information technology contributes to new knowledge and/or research efficiency, and/or has the potential to contribute significantly to improved outcomes?approachare the overall strategy, methodology, and analyses well-reasoned and appropriate to accomplish the specific aims of the project? have the investigators included plans to address weaknesses in the rigor of prior research that serves as the key support for the proposed project? have the investigators presented strategies to ensure a robust and unbiased approach, as appropriate for the work proposed? are potential problems, alternative strategies, and benchmarks for success presented? if the project is in the early stages of development, will the strategy establish feasibility and will particularly risky aspects be managed? have the investigators presented adequate plans to address relevant biological variables, such as sex, for studies in vertebrate animals or human subjects?if the project involves human subjects and/or nih-defined clinical research, are the plans to address 1) the protection of human subjects from research risks, and 2) inclusion (or exclusion) of individuals on the basis of sex/gender, race, and ethnicity, as well as the inclusion or exclusion of individuals of all ages (including children and older adults), justified in terms of the scientific goals and research strategy proposed?for studies to identify factors that impact access, utilization, continuity, quality, value, outcomes, or scalability of mental health services, are the factors mutable and what is the potential of the factors to serve as targets in future intervention development?for studies that develop and test new research tools, measures, or methods, how broadly and efficiently usable will the products bein future studies?for studies testing the feasibility of integrating and/or analyzing existing data sets, will the results contribute to understanding factors affecting access, quality, delivery or outcomes of care?how well does the application describe any planned collaborations or input from stakeholders, and to what extent will these collaborations contribute to the utility of study results? did the applicant adequately consider convening and utilizing an advisory board or strategically including end users as part of the study team?if appropriate, what is the strength of the evidence provided that outcome measures are meaningful to the stakeholders involved?for studies that involve the assessment of patient-level outcomes, does the application adequately describe plans for the detection of suicidal behavior/ideation and non-suicidal self-harm, and for clinical management to reduce subject risk when these factors are identified?environmentwill the scientific environment in which the work will be done contribute to the probability of success? are the institutional support, equipment, and other physical resources available to the investigators adequate for the project proposed? will the project benefit from unique features of the scientific environment, subject populations, or collaborative arrangements?how well will the study leverage resources and expertise from existing infrastructure (e.g., ctsas; practice-based research networks; other nimh investments like the mhrn, alacrity centers, and epinet; electronic medical records; administrative databases; patient registries) or utilize other available resources to increase the efficiency of participant recruitment and data collection? if existing infrastructure will not be leveraged, does the applicant provide a reasonable justification?additional review criteriaas applicable for the project proposed, reviewers will evaluate the following additional items while determining scientific and technical merit, and in providing an overall impact score, but will not give separate scores for these items.protections for human subjectsfor research that involves human subjects but does not involve one of the categories of research that are exempt under 45 cfr part 46, the committee will evaluate the justification for involvement of human subjects and the proposed protections from
