national institutes of health (nih)national eye institute (nei)u01 research project – cooperative agreementsnot-od-23-012 reminder: forms-h grant application forms and instructions must be used for due dates on or after january 25, 2023 - new grant application instructions now availablenot-od-22-190 - adjustments to nih and ahrq grant application due dates between september 22 and september 30, 2022see section iii. 3. additional information on eligibility.the nei uses u01 cooperative agreement awards to support investigator-initiated early-stage clinical trials that are greater than minimal risk and typically are phase i or ii trials. the risk level of the u01 trial requires appropriate performance oversight and safety monitoring. for purposes of this foa, the proposed study must be intended to evaluate interventions aimed at screening, diagnosing, preventing, or treating vision disorders.applicants are strongly advised to consult with nei program staff prior to submitting an application with human subjects to determine the appropriate funding opportunity.not applicableall applications are due by 5:00 pm local time of applicant organization.applicants are encouraged to apply early to allow adequate time to make any corrections to errors found in the application during the submission process by the due date.not applicableit is critical that applicants follow the instructions in the research (r) instructions in the sf424 (r&r) application guide, except where instructed to do otherwise (in this foa or in a notice from nih guide for grants and contracts).conformance to all requirements (both in the application guide and the foa) is required and strictly enforced. applicants must read and follow all application instructions in the application guide as well as any program-specific instructions noted in section iv. when the program-specific instructions deviate from those in the application guide, follow the program-specific instructions.applications that do not comply with these instructions may be delayed or not accepted for review.there are several options available to submit your application through grants.gov to nih and department of health and human services partners. you must use one of these submission options to access the application forms for this opportunity.purpose:the purpose of this funding opportunity announcement (foa) is to invite cooperative agreement (u01) applications to the national eye institute (nei) for early-stage clinical trials that are greater than minimal risk but are not administratively complex. projects that are administratively complex often involve several recruiting clinical centers, an independent data coordinating center and often include resource centers. the proposed trials using this u01 mechanism typically are phase i or ii trials with strong scientific rationale and must evaluate interventions aimed at screening, diagnosing, preventing, or treating vision disorders.applications supported by this foa must meet the nih definition of a clinical trial (see not-od-15-015) and must be greater than minimal risk trials. as defined in 45 cfr § 46.102, a minimal risk trial is one in which the probability and magnitude of harm or discomfort anticipated in the research are not greater in and of themselves than those ordinarily encountered in daily life or during the performance of routine physical or psychological examinations or tests.backgroundcurrently, the nei supports mechanistic or minimal risk trials using the r01, r21, r15, and sbir/sttr (r43/r44 and r41/r42) grant mechanisms and supports large-scale, multi-center clinical trials, human gene-transfer and stem cell therapy trials, and other complex or high resource- or safety-risk clinical trials using the ug1 cooperative agreement mechanism. ug1 clinical trials are multifaceted and typically funded as a group of single-component companion grant awards including the chair’s grant, the coordinating center, and resource centers, when appropriate.this nei cooperative agreement (u01) for clinical trials is designed to support early-stage clinical trials that are greater than minimal risk but are not suitable under nei collaborative clinical vision research: chair's grant (ug1) https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/pa-files/par-21-041.html.scope of this funding opportunity announcement:the scope of this foa is to support u01 applications for clinical trials to investigate the safety and/or efficacy of screening, diagnostic, preventative, or therapeutic interventions. this foa is specifically intended for early-stage clinical trials with greater than minimal risk that meet all of the following criteria:examples of appropriate studies include, but are not limited to, those designed to:milestonesdelineation of milestones is a key characteristic of the nei cooperative agreement (u01) for early-stage clinical trials with greater than minimal risk. a milestone is defined as a scheduled event in the project timeline, signifying the completion of a major project stage or activity.applications not responsive to this foa:the following types of activities remain outside of the scope of this foa, and applications proposing such activities will be considered non-responsive to this foa and will be withdrawn without review:data monitoring and safety committee (dsmc):a dsmc is required for this mechanism. the dsmc is an independent group composed of individuals not directly involved in patient care or data collection for the study who are responsible for safeguarding the interests of all trial participants, assessing the safety and efficacy of the treatment during the trial, and for monitoring the overall conduct of the trial. the dsmc operates under the guidance of an approved charter.programmatic oversight:nei program staff will closely monitor progress in meeting the milestones of all projects funded by cooperative agreements under this foa and will also oversee the management and reporting of adverse events and have regular communications with the pd(s)/pi(s). the nei program official will participate in the dsmc meetings and will serve as a technical representative to the dsmc.applicants are strongly encouraged to contact scientific/research staff as plans for an application are being developed (see section vii, agency contacts), and no later than 12 weeks prior to the anticipated application submission date.see section viii. other information for award authorities and regulations.cooperative agreement: a support mechanism used when there will be substantial federal scientific or programmatic involvement. substantial involvement means that, after award, nih scientific or program staff will assist, guide, coordinate, or participate in project activities. see section vi.2 for additional information about the substantial involvement for this foa.the oer glossary and the sf424 (r&r) application guide provide details on these application types. only those application types listed here are allowed for this foa.required: only accepting applications that propose clinical trial(s).need help determining whether you are

information for certain “applicable clinical trials” on the clinicaltrials.gov protocol registration and results system information website (https://register.clinicaltrials.gov). nih expects registration and results reporting of all trials whether required under the law or not. for more information, see https://grants.nih.gov/policy/clinical-trials/reporting/index.htminstitutional review board or independent ethics committee approval: recipient institutions must ensure that all protocols are reviewed by their irb or iec. to help ensure the safety of participants enrolled in nih-funded studies, the recipient must provide nih copies of documents related to all major changes in the status of ongoing protocols.data and safety monitoring requirements: the nih policy for data and safety monitoring requires oversight and monitoring of all nih-conducted or -supported human biomedical and behavioral intervention studies (clinical trials) to ensure the safety of participants and the validity and integrity of the data. further information concerning these requirements is found at http://grants.nih.gov/grants/policy/hs/data_safety.htm and in the application instructions (sf424 (r&r) and phs 398).investigational new drug or investigational device exemption requirements: consistent with federal regulations, clinical research projects involving the use of investigational therapeutics, vaccines, or other medical interventions (including licensed products and devices for a purpose other than that for which they were licensed) in humans under a research protocol must be performed under a food and drug administration (fda) investigational new drug (ind) or investigational device exemption (ide).2. administrative and national policy requirementsall nih grant and cooperative agreement awards include the nih grants policy statement as part of the noa. for these terms of award, see the nih grants policy statement part ii: terms and conditions of nih grant

organization successfully compete for an award, recipients of federal financial assistance (ffa) from hhs must administer their programs in compliance with federal civil rights laws that prohibit discrimination on the basis of race, color, national origin, disability, age and, in some circumstances, religion, conscience, and sex (including gender identify, sexual orientation, and pregnancy). this includes ensuring programs are accessible to persons with limited english proficiency and persons with disabilities. the hhs office for civil rights provides guidance on complying with civil rights laws enforced by hhs. please see https://www.hhs.gov/civil-rights/for-providers/provider-obligations/index.html and https://www.hhs.gov/civil-rights/for-individuals/nondiscrimination/index.htmlhhs recognizes that research projects are often limited in scope for many reasons that are nondiscriminatory, such as the principal investigator’s scientific interest, funding limitations, recruitment requirements, and other considerations. thus, criteria in research protocols that target or exclude certain populations are warranted where nondiscriminatory justifications establish that such criteria are appropriate with respect to the health or safety of the subjects, the scientific study design, or the purpose of the research. for additional guidance regarding how the provisions apply to nih grant programs, please contact the scientific/research contact that is identified in section vii under agency contacts
