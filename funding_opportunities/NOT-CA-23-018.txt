risk factors, identifying biomarkers for early detection, best screening modalities, and preventive interventions for early-onset colorectal cancer (eocrc), defined as occurring before 50 years of age.while the incidence and mortality of crc have significantly declined in the us since the mid-1980s, an age-adjusted analysis shows that this favorable trend was limited to screening-aged individuals. between 2008 and 2017 crc death rates declined by 0.6% annually in individuals aged 50 to 64 years and an even larger annual decline (3%) occurred in the population ?65 years of age. during this same period, the incidence of crc in subjects <50 years of age increased 2% annually, and related deaths in this age group increased 1.3% annually. there were approximately 18,000 new cases of eocrc diagnosed in 2020. 12% of the newly diagnosed crcs occurred in people younger than 50 and 7% of the crc mortality occurred in this younger population. these trends are concerning, and research focused on the etiology, early detection, screening, and prevention of eocrc are urgently needed.the biomedical research community currently has little guidance on how to find the at-risk younger population, which is necessary to disrupt this concerning trend. both patients and healthcare providers often do not recognize and act on what would be red-flag symptoms in an older population. this leads to the younger population being diagnosed at more advanced stages, with poorly differentiated tumors. several clinical and biological features of eocrc also differ from those of late-onset disease. early-onset tumors typically occur in the distal colon and rectum, compared with late-onset disease, where proximal tumors predominate. the eocrc anatomical location may provide important insight into the underlying pathogenesis since there is increasing evidence that ascending colon cancers differ biologically from descending colon and rectal cancers and there is a disparate increase in the incidence of rectal versus colon cancer.regional, racial, and socioeconomic disparities have been well documented but are also not well understood. understanding the molecular/genetic, environmental, and regional drivers that account for these disparities is critical for characterizing risk factors and establishing evidence-based, cost-effective early detection, prevention, and screening modalities for people younger than 45. further, through a better understanding of clinical and biological eocrc features, potential biomarkers for early cancer detection, screening modalities, and interception strategies can be identified to ultimately reverse the upward trend of eocrc incidence and mortality.given the likelihood that the rising incidence of early-onset cancers is multifactorial, successful applications may include investigation of genomic/epigenomic effects of environmental exposures or novel screening approaches that use currently available, non-invasive screening procedures (fit, cologuard, msept9) or multi-cancer early detection using liquid biopsy tests. validating existing screening procedures for this younger population or developing new approaches based on either epidemiology or basic biology methods would help disrupt the eocrc alarming rise.although increasing at a concerning rate, the incidence of early-onset cancers is relatively uncommon; therefore, when appropriate, applicants may consider making use of existing cohorts and data repositories. preclinical studies establishing new models to test critical gene–environment interactions would help define mechanisms of pathogenesis. studies that identify biomarkers for early detection focused on how changes in screening practices and healthcare provider education could reduce mortality in this population are also encouraged. studies investigating the role of risk factors in the context of differences in racial/ethnic distribution would also be responsive to this nosi.approaches may include epidemiological and/or clinical cohort studies (retrospective or prospective) to characterize risk factors, identify biomarkers that correlate with risk, or preclinical studies focusing on the etiologic factors that affect the development and progression to early-onset cancer. studies may include examining how dietary, environmental, infectious, and pharmaceutical exposures in childhood alter immune function, metabolism, and/or microbial interactions with the host that contribute to the initiation or progression of eocrc. clinical studies that help in planning/feasibility of randomized clinical trials that help to identify best screening modalities, and preventive interventions are encouraged. all research proposals are encouraged to evaluate factors of race, ethnicity, and socioeconomics on eocrc.eligible applications should focus on areas related to:applications considered not responsive to this nosi will include research focused
