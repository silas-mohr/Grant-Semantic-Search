encourage inquiries concerning this funding opportunity and welcome the opportunity to answer questions from potential applicants.the overall goal of the nih research career development program is to help ensure that a diverse pool of highly trained scientists is available in appropriate scientific disciplines to address biomedical, behavioral, and clinical research needs. nih institutes and centers (ics) support a variety of mentored and non-mentored career development award programs designed to foster the transition of new investigators to research independence and to support established investigators in achieving specific objectives. candidates should review the different career development (k) award programs to determine the best program to support their goals. more information about career programs may be found at the nih extramural training mechanisms website.the objective of the nih international research career development award (k43) is to support research scientists from low-or middle-income countries (lmics) who hold a junior faculty positions at academic or research institutions. in many lmic institutions there is little support for junior faculty with long-term research training to launch an independent research career due to lack of protected time for research activities, inadequate pilot research project funding opportunities, insufficient training in advanced research methodology and data analysis, lack of mentorship in manuscript and grant writing and meager institutional support for developing, submitting and administering research applications and awards. this intensive, mentored research career development experience under the guidance of experienced lmic and u.s. mentors is expected to foster an independently funded research career for the most promising lmic junior research scientist faculty. overall, it is expected that this program will increase the scientific capacity for health research at lmic institutions and foster long term research collaborations with u.s. scientists.the award will provide salary and research project support. awardees are expected to increase their capabilities in advanced research methodology, analysis and data management, research administrative skills, responsible conduct of research, scientific presentation, and manuscript and grant writing. applications should propose targeted activities and research projects that will propel awardees to become competitive principal investigators for new research project grant funding by the end of the grant period. this foa invites applications from eligible lmic research scientists at lmic academic or research institutions who propose both critically needed career development activities and a research project that are highly relevant to the health priorities of their countries. the research activities should take place primarily in the lmic.interests of participating nih institutes, centers and officesthe mission of the national institute on deafness and other communication disorders (nidcd) is to improve the lives of the millions of people with hearing loss and other communication disorders, spanning

relevant to lmic setting including, but not limited to, clinical and translational research, behavioral and social sciences research, patient reported outcomes research, are encouraged. the proposed career development and mentoring must be focused on developing independent researchers in the field of cancer in a manner that increases the research capacity at the lmic institution. mentors should have a track record of research in cancer.the national human genome research institute (nhgri) is interested in applications from individuals pursuing careers as researchers in the area of the ethical, legal, and social implications (elsi) of genetics and genomics research or the use of genetics in clinical settings. examples of topics appropriate for exploration can be found on the elsi research priorities website at: http://www.genome.gov/27543732. nhgri may also support applications from individuals who are developing methods and research resources that support, or are conducting basic and translational research in: genomic sciences, informatics, implementation of genomics in clinical care (genomic medicine), and cost-effectiveness of genomic interventions. the specific research topic proposed should apply across a broad spectrum of diseases and health conditions and should not be specific to just one disease, except to the extent that a particular disease may serve as a model with projects that capitalize on unique opportunities to use, as models, diseases and conditions that are more difficult to study in the u.s. because of prevalence or other factors will be considered. examples of such conditions might include, but are not limited to, sickle cell disease and thalassemias, apoa associated kidney disease, and severe adverse drug reactions with higher frequency outside the u.s., such as stevens johnson syndrome (sjs).the national institute of dental and craniofacial research (nidcr) is interested in applications with a research focus on dental, oral, or craniofacial conditions that occur more frequently in the lmic or are of a high public health burden; research addressing health disparities in dental, oral, or craniofacial conditions; and research to achieve national or regional goals in oral and dental health such as those articulated by the world health organization. examples include, but are not limited to: working with local communities to establish the best means of delivering preventive oral health care; establishing successful approaches to deliver fluoride to a local population, particularly in areas without potable water; studying oral pre-malignant lesions associated with betel nut use; and studying the interplay of genes and environment in dental, oral, or craniofacial health by leveraging environments specific to the country. the program and these topics are responsive to goals 2, 3, and 4 of the nidcr strategic plan (http://www.nidcr.nih.gov/research/researchpriorities/strategicplan/).the national institute of environmental health sciences (niehs) is interested in applications that address or seek to understand how exposures to toxic environmental insults alter biologic processes, are linked to disease initiation, progression or morbidity, and activities that lead to the development of prevention and intervention strategies to reduce environmentally induced diseases in lmics. examples of environmental exposures relevant to the mission of the niehs include industrial chemicals or manufacturing byproducts, e-waste, metals, pesticides, herbicides, and inhaled toxicants including indoor air pollutants from cooking and other sources (https://www.niehs.nih.gov/about/strategicplan/). topics and disease outcomes of particular interest include airway diseases, cvd and neurological disorders, children’s environmental health and the unique vulnerability of developing children to harmful environmental exposures including outcomes such as low birth weight or premature birth, and research exploring exposures during early life stages or critical windows of susceptibility that may directly or indirectly affect the risk of developing disease. career development applications that focus on the effects of alcohol, chemotherapeutic agents, smoking, except when considered as a secondary smoke exposure as a component in the indoor environment (particularly in children), drugs of abuse, pharmaceuticals, dietary nutrients, and infectious or parasitic agents are not of interest to niehs.the national institute of mental health (nimh) is interested in applications that focus on mental disorders in lmics, specifically conditions and disorders that affect cognition, perceptions, mood, social and emotional processing, daily functioning, behavior and relationships. mental disorders are a leading cause of disease burden worldwide, estimated based on disability adjusted life years (dalys). mental disorders of interest include, but are not limited to depressive disorders, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, autism spectrum disorders, anxiety disorders, trauma and stressor-related disorders such as posttraumatic stress disorder. nimh is particularly interested in research that addresses disparities in access to mental health care in lmics, better understanding the root causes, risk and protective factors, early detection and early intervention, integration of mental health care into care for chronic, non-communicable or communicable diseases. nimh is also interested in applications that investigate the optimal combination of mental health interventions (e.g., screening and care), including those that leverage implementation science in lmic contexts, and address the care of individuals living with hiv, or placed at risk for hiv. these themes are consistent with many of the grand challenges in global mental health (i.e., identify root causes, risk and protective factors; advance prevention and early intervention; improve treatments and expand access to quality care; build human resource research capacity; and transform health system and policy responses; grand challenges in global mental health). nimh is also interested in applications that target hiv-related research topics such as the epidemiology, natural history and pathogenesis of hiv-associated cns dysfunction before and after treatment initiation in adult and pediatric populations; hiv persistence and cure in the cns; examination of the neurobehavioral consequences of in-utero exposure to antiretroviral medication and/or hiv; basic and applied behavioral and social science to prevent new hiv infections and limit morbidity and mortality among those living with hiv, use of data science to support hiv prevention and care, and implementation science to determine the best strategies for implementing and scaling up evidence-based interventions to prevent or treat hiv.the national institute of neurological disorders and stroke (ninds) is interested in supporting basic, mechanistic, epidemiological, prevention, translational and clinical research across the spectrum of neurological, neuromuscular and neurovascular diseases and disorders in all ages. in addition to

nih hiv/aids research priorities, and the nih plan for hiv-related research for the year they are applying.applicants are encouraged to review answers to frequently asked questions about the fogarty emerging global leader award program at http://www.fic.nih.gov/programs/pages/emerging-global-leader.aspx , which will be updated on a regular basis.individuals who are citizens, non-citizen nationals or permanent residents of the united states, and who are based at us institutions, are not eligible for this k43 award but may apply for the international research scientist development awards (irsda (k01) par-21-104 or par-21-015 or other similar awards (see https://researchtraining.nih.gov/programs/career-development).note: this funding opportunity announcement (foa) is designed specifically for applicants proposing research that does not involve leading an independent clinical trial, a clinical trial feasibility study, or an ancillary clinical trial ancillary study to a clinical trial. applicants to this foa are permitted to propose research experience in a clinical trial led by a mentor or co-mentor. applicants proposing a clinical trial or an ancillary study to an ongoing clinical trial as lead investigator, should apply to the companion foa (par-21-251). nih defines a clinical trial as "a research study in which one or more human subjects are prospectively assigned to one or more interventions (which may include placebo or other control) to evaluate the effects of those interventions on health-related biomedical or behavioral outcomes." (not-od-15-015). nih not only supports trials of safety and efficacy, it also supports mechanistic exploratory studies that meet the definition of a clinical trial and are designed to explore or understand a biological or behavioral process, the pathophysiology of a disease, or the mechanism of action of an intervention. these studies may focus on basic and/or translational discovery research in healthy human subjects and in human subjects who are affected by the pathophysiology of diseases and disorders. by addressing basic questions and concepts in biology, behavior, and pathophysiology, these studies may provide insight into understanding human diseases and disorders along with potential treatments or preventive strategies. nih also supports biomarker studies that meet the definition of a clinical trial and that may provide information about physiological function, target engagement of novel therapeutics, and/or the impact of therapeutics on treatment response. nih thus supports studies that meet the definition of clinical trials (as noted above) but do not seek to establish safety, clinical efficacy, effectiveness, clinical management, and/or implementation of preventive, therapeutic, and services interventions.see section viii. other information for award authorities and regulations.grant: a support mechanism providing money, property, or both to an eligible entity to
