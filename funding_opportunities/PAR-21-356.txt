support and advancement of the national swine resource and research center (nsrrc). this foa focuses on providing a resource accessible to the biomedical research community. the main purpose of funding animal model resources by the office of research infrastructure programs (orip) is to increase the understanding of human health and disease through the continued support of animal models, in this case large animal models (swine) to support biomedical research.the use of swine as animal models has and will continue to contribute to the acquisition of new knowledge to improve both human and animal health. domestic swine (sus scrofa domesticus) are closely related to humans in terms of anatomy, genetics and physiology, with their organs sharing common functional features. swine anatomy and size (from miniature to large breeds) facilitate performance of various surgical and non-surgical procedures used in human medicine (i.e., catheterization, heart surgery, and endoscopy) that are difficult to perform in other animal models, including rodents. the availability of the sequence of the pig genome and the identification of many putative disease-causing variants have extended the potential applications of the pig as a model for biomedical studies. advances in genetic engineering, powered by new genome editing technologies linked to the swine genome, enhance the utility of swine as models of human genetic diseases. the ability to generate transgenics and knockouts in combination with somatic nuclear transfer procedures has enabled the nsrrc to create several pig models for specific human diseases, such as immunocompromised/humanized (severe combined immunodeficiency) pigs; αgal knockout and other genetically modified pigs for xenotransplantation of organs into nonhuman primates; models of mammary tumors, muscular dystrophy, phenylketonuria, and fanconi anemia group a; and the oncopig for cancer research. thus, swine hold promises of becoming better predictive animal models for clinical research and therapeutic treatments in humans, and for studying critical aspects of basic scientific knowledge that impact advances in biomedical research. research with swine models is supporting several clinical breakthroughs in the fields of regenerative medicine (cell-based therapies to test human adult-derived stem cells in pig models of heart failure and fibrotic lung disease), infectious diseases (especially research on influenza pathogenesis, immunity, and transmission to inform the development of improved vaccine strategies and to enhance pandemic preparedness), cancer, vaccine development, inborn errors of metabolism and cardiovascular development and congenital heart disease, amongst others. to highlight one significant contribution, research using genetically modified pig-to-primate organ xenotransplantation is successfully breaking new ground for alternatives to address the severe shortage of human organ donors.continuity of the nsrrc will ensure that biomedical research investigators across a variety of disciplines have uninterrupted access to critically needed swine models. the nsrrc’s function is to serve as a national repository and stock center to fulfill the requests from the scientific community for the creation, acquisition, maintenance, preservation, and distribution of genetically modified swine models for studies of human diseases, as well as the cryopreservation, storage, and reconstitution of embryos and germplasm. in addition, the nsrrc will continue to serve as a central resource for reagents, information (i.e., genetic engineering strategies for model creation, swine husbandry, detection of pathogens, diagnostics for biosecurity) and training (i.e., pre-veterinary and veterinary students, veterinarians, graduate students, postdocs, scientists) related to use of swine models in biomedical research. it will continue to develop methods for improving the health and biosafety of swine strains by establishing standards and procedures for generating specific pathogen free and more vigorous swine strains, as well as for viral and pathogens surveillance and disease outbreak assessment and tracking. it is also essential that the nsrrc’s infrastructure can accommodate specific needs for isolation, growth, preservation, expansion, and distribution of cells, tissues, and organs from these animals.the resource was originally founded in 2003 under rfa-rr-03-003 as a cooperative agreement (u42) to provide swine models and related biological materials to support biomedical research on the understanding of disease pathobiology. the nsrrc is a unique resource that supports the creation, curation, preservation, and distribution of swine for basic and pre-clinical research supported by nih.the nsrrc should include, but is not limited to, the following areas of service and support:see section viii. other information for award authorities and regulations.cooperative agreement: a support mechanism used when there will be substantial federal scientific or programmatic involvement. substantial involvement means that, after award, nih

application is a multicomponent application, with an "overall" component that is the aggregate of the core (resource) and the project (applied research) sections. during the review process, reviewers will first consider each of the review criteria listed for the resource and applied research and provide "merit descriptors" for each of them. the three potential merit descriptors are outstanding, acceptable, or unacceptable. once the resource and applied research are completed, numerical scoring will be assigned for the overall application. in the detailed sections below, each of the three components' review criteria appear in the standard order used in foas.reviewers will provide an overall impact score to reflect their assessment of the likelihood for the center (nsrrc) to exert a sustained, powerful influence on the research field(s) involved, in consideration of the following review criteria and additional review criteria (as applicable for the center proposed).reviewers will consider each of the review criteria below in the determination of scientific merit, and give a separate score for each. an application does not need to be strong in all categories to be judged likely

administration regulations at 45 cfr part 75 and 2 cfr part 200, and other hhs, phs, and nih grant administration policies. the administrative and funding instrument used for this program will be the cooperative agreement, an "assistance" mechanism (rather than an "acquisition" mechanism), in which substantial nih programmatic involvement with the recipients is anticipated during the performance of the activities. under the cooperative agreement, the nih purpose is to support and stimulate the recipients' activities by involvement in and otherwise working jointly with the recipients in a partnership role; it is not to assume direction, prime responsibility, or a dominant role in the activities. consistent with this concept, the dominant role and prime responsibility resides with the recipients for the project as a whole, although specific tasks and activities may be shared among the recipients and the nih as defined below.the pd(s)/pi(s) will have the primary responsibility for:nih staff have substantial programmatic involvement that is above and beyond the normal stewardship role in awards, as described below:orip project scientists involvement:additionally, an orip program officer will be responsible for the normal scientific and programmatic stewardship of the award and will be named in the award notice.orip program officer involvement:areas of joint responsibilities:program steering committee involvement:when multiple years are involved, recipients will be required to submit the research performance progress report (rppr) annually and financial statements as required in the nih grants policy statement.a final rppr, invention statement, and the expenditure data portion of the federal financial report are required for closeout of an award, as described in the nih grants policy statement. nih foas outline intended research goals and objectives. post award, nih will review and measure performance based on the details and outcomes that are shared within the rppr, as described at 45 cfr part 75.301 and 2 cfr part 200.301.the federal funding accountability and transparency act of 2006 (transparency act), includes a requirement for
