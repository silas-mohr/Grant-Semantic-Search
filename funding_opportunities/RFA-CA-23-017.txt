funding opportunity announcement (foa) is to invite cooperative agreement (u24) applications for the continued development and sustainment of high value informatics research resources to improve the acquisition, management, analysis, and dissemination of data and knowledge across the cancer research continuum including cancer biology, cancer treatment and diagnosis, early cancer detection, risk assessment and prevention, cancer control and epidemiology, and/or cancer health disparities. as a component of the nci's informatics technology for cancer research (itcr) program, this foa focuses on sustaining operations and improving the user experience and availability of existing, widely-adopted informatics tools and resources. this is in contrast to early-stage and advanced development efforts to generate these tools and resources that are supported by companion itcr foas. the central mission of itcr is to promote research-driven informatics technology across the development lifecycle to address priority needs in cancer research. in order to be successful, the proposed sustainment plan must provide clear justification for why the research resource should be maintained and how it has benefited and will continue to benefit the cancer research field. in addition, mechanisms for assessing and maximizing the value of the resource to researchers and supporting collaboration and deep engagement between the resource and the targeted research community should be described.30 days prior to the application due dateall applications are due by 5:00 pm local time of applicant organization.applicants are encouraged to apply early to allow adequate time to make any corrections to errors found in the application during the submission process by the due date.no late

are often limited in scope for many reasons that are nondiscriminatory, such as the principal investigator’s scientific interest, funding limitations, recruitment requirements, and other considerations. thus, criteria in research protocols that target or exclude certain populations are warranted where nondiscriminatory justifications establish that such criteria are appropriate with respect to the health or safety of the subjects, the scientific study design, or the purpose of the research. for additional guidance regarding how the provisions apply to nih grant programs, please
