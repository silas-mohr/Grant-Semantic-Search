Understanding and Modifying Temporal Dynamics of Coordinated Neural Activity (R01 Clinical Trial Optional)
national institutes of health (nih)national institute of mental health (nimh)r01 research project grant see notices of special interest associated with this funding opportunitysee section iii. 3. additional information on eligibility.a growing body of evidence suggests that optimal cognitive, affective, and social processes are associated with highly coordinated neural activity. these findings indicate that oscillatory rhythms, their co-modulation across frequency bands, spike-phase correlations, spike population dynamics, and other patterns might be useful drivers of therapeutic development for the treatment of cognitive, social, or affective symptoms in neuropsychiatric disorders. this funding opportunity announcement (foa) supports projects that test whether modifying electrophysiological patterns during behavior can improve cognitive, affective, or social processing. applications must use experimental designs that incorporate active manipulations to address at least one, and ideally more, of the following topics: (1) in animals or humans, determine which parameters of neural coordination, when manipulated in isolation, improve particular aspects of cognitive, affective, or social processing; (2) in animals or humans, determine how particular abnormalities at the genomic, molecular, or cellular levels affect the systems-level coordination of electrophysiological patterns during behavior; (3) determine whether in vivo, systems-level electrophysiological changes in behaving animals predict analogous electrophysiological and cognitive improvements in healthy persons or clinical populations; and (4) use biologically-realistic computational models that include systems-level aspects to understand the function and mechanisms by which oscillatory and other electrophysiological patterns unfold across the brain to impact cognitive, affective, or social processing. this foa uses the r01 grant mechanism, whereas its companion foa, par-21-176, seeks shorter, higher-risk r21 grant applications.not applicableall applications are due by 5:00 pm local time of applicant organization. all types of non-aids applications allowed for

application forms for this opportunity.purposethe purpose of this funding opportunity announcement (foa) is to lay the groundwork for developing interventions at the network/circuit level that might be used as potential treatments for cognitive, affective, or social deficits in psychiatric disorders. a rich body of knowledge exists regarding the systems-level coordination of temporal patterns of electrophysiological activity in the brain. one key principle that has emerged from basic systems-level neuroscience is that brain rhythms appear to be necessary for normal cognition, including phase-amplitude coupling of slow and fast rhythms, spike-phase correlations such as hippocampal theta precession, and the re-activation of previously experienced neural activity on specific oscillatory frequencies. on the clinical side, cognitive symptoms, in particular, are among the least tractable and most disabling problems across a wide range of brain disorders, including autism and schizophrenia, because they affect the ability to live independently, such as holding a job and managing a bank account. almost none of the existing treatments for neuropsychiatric illnesses were developed for the purpose of modulating systems-level coordination of neural activity, yet this is the level at which brain processes such as attention, memory, and social processing emerge. even for medications that are based on a rational understanding of single-gene disorders, such as fragile x, rett, or angelman syndromes, it has been surprisingly difficult to ameliorate cognitive, affective, or social symptoms in patients with these disorders. however, existing medications act at the molecular level, and they might not have a useful effect at the network/circuit level. therefore, it might be advantageous and even necessary to begin to address cognitive, affective, and social domains of function with a greater consideration of the circuit-level electrophysiological patterns and to test whether modulating these patterns can improve function. the key idea is to evaluate any intervention, whether pharmacological or not, at the network/circuit level rather than exclusively at the molecular level. evaluating interventions at the circuit level might be helpful regardless of whether the interventions themselves are at the genetic, molecular, or cellular level via pharmacology or gene editing, or whether the intervention is at the circuit level such as electrical or magnetic stimulation. the purpose of this foa is to seek applications that use active manipulations to address at least one, and ideally more, of the following points: (1) in animals or humans, determine which aspect of neural coordination, when manipulated in isolation, improves cognitive, affective, or social processing; (2) in animals or humans, determine how particular abnormalities at the cellular or molecular level, such as specific receptor dysfunction, affect the coordination of electrophysiological patterns during behavior; (3) determine whether in vivo, systems-level electrophysiological changes in behaving animals predict analogous electrophysiological and cognitive improvements in normal humans or clinical populations; and (4) use systems-level computational modeling to develop a principled understanding of the function and mechanisms by which oscillatory and other electrophysiological patterns unfold across the brain (cortically and subcortically) to impact cognitive, affective, or social processing.because this foa expects the inclusion of an active manipulation of a biological process, studies with human subjects will meet the nih definition of a clinical trial. however, this foa will only accept a subset of nih-defined clinical trials, namely, mechanistic clinical trials (in addition to accepting research with animals). nih defines mechanistic clinical trials as studies designed to understand a biological or behavioral process, the pathophysiology of a disease, or the mechanism of action of an intervention (see not-mh-18-004 for more detailed examples of mechanistic clinical trials). by contrast, this foa will not accept studies whose purpose is to evaluate safety, clinical efficacy, clinical effectiveness, management, and/or implementation of an intervention. instead, these types of studies should be submitted to one of the nimh foas that support clinical trials evaluating safety, clinical efficacy, clinical effectiveness, management and/or implementation. for more information, please refer to the clinical trials funding opportunity announcements webpage.all applicants are encouraged to contact scientific/research staff at nimh before submitting a grant application.backgroundcognition appears to emerge at the level of populations of neurons, with information represented and organized as action potentials and network events that are temporally coordinated across brain areas. for example, there have been notable advances in our basic understanding of the role of local field potential (lfp) oscillations and large-scale coordination of neural networks in learning and memory. in rodents, particular patterns of temporal dynamics have been shown to proportionally improve or worsen working memory, and particular lfp oscillatory bands predict episodic/relational learning. theta phase precession is another well-known precise temporal code that might be required for optimal cognition, and the precise reactivation of neural activity during hippocampal sharp wave ripples is also a temporally coordinated representation that might be necessary for memory consolidation or decision making.from a disease standpoint, electrophysiological aberrations exist in many brain disorders, and recent findings suggest that modulating electrophysiological patterns could potentially have therapeutic benefit. in schizophrenia, findings have suggested that systems-level electrophysiological endophenotypes are modifiable and that such modifications have the potential to improve cognition. in autism, the modest amounts of electrophysiological data that exist in patients and model organisms suggest that this disorder also has disruptions in temporal coordination of neural signals, and that electrophysiological patterns at the level of neural populations might represent an intermediate, modifiable phenotype.these basic and translational findings should be expanded to better understand the brain algorithms that implement learning, memory consolidation, attention, reasoning, affect regulation, and social interactions. work in non-human primates is also highly encouraged, as it would provide a bridge between rodent and human work with regard to neuroanatomy and cognitive capabilities.the underlying premise of this foa is that cognitive, affective, and social dysfunction may result in part from compromised circuit-level electrophysiological patterns; that these patterns are necessary for normal brain function; and therefore, treatments whose goal is to improve these domains of function might be more effective if they improve the underlying aberrant electrophysiological patterns.research objectivesapplications must address at least one, and ideally more, of the following topic areas:topic 1: temporal dynamics of neural patterns that impact cognition, affect, or social behaviorin animals or humans, determine which aspects of temporal coordination of systems-level neural activity affect particular domains of function such as working memory, long-term memory, relational/spatial processing, attention, cognitive control, decision making, affect regulation, or social cognition. projects should manipulate specific aspects of the electrophysiological patterns (e.g., the power of oscillatory frequencies during particular task periods, or the degree of phase-amplitude coupling of particular frequency pairs) to determine what parameters, if manipulated appropriately, might yield the most robust and reliable improvements in behavior. active manipulations proposed in grant applications that address topic 1 can consist of electrical or magnetic brain stimulation, optogenetics, pharmacological compounds including novel or existing medications if well justified, or other modalities. novel interventions are encouraged if they might provide greater temporal and/or spatial resolution. it is expected that applications provide a strong scientific rationale for the specific biological intervention chosen, and why it is expected to selectively alter electrophysiological measures in a particular direction. all projects should include measures of neural activity at the systems level during awake behavior.topic 2: understanding how molecular aberrations lead to systems-level discoordinationin animals or humans, understand how particular abnormalities at the cellular or molecular level, such as glutamate or gaba receptor dysfunction, affect the coordination of electrophysiological patterns during cognitive, affective, or social processing. single-gene disorders in particular, such as fragile x or rett syndromes, might be a good opportunity to study such mechanistic questions in the context of circuit-level dynamics, but the case can also be made for neuropsychiatric disorders of more heterogeneous etiology. the emphasis can be on discovering ways to rescue the circuit-level discoordination with either molecular/cellular interventions (e.g., pharmacology, genomic interventions), or with neurophysiology manipulations such as patterned electrical or optogenetic stimulation. the outcomes must be measured at both the systems electrophysiology level and at the behavioral level.topic 3: animal-to-human translationdetermine whether the changes in neural coordination patterns that improve cognition in animals predict analogous electrophysiological and cognitive improvements in healthy humans and/or clinical populations. a key goal is to understand the translational value of systems electrophysiology in pre-clinical models, to know whether an electrophysiological pattern identified in a relevant model system is predictive of a similarly aberrant pattern in patients, and whether the effects of any interventions in animals are predictive of their effects in humans. another goal is to characterize aberrant electrophysiological patterns during cognition in clinical patients, although electrophysiological recordings in humans, if there is no active intervention, should be accompanied by parallel work in animals that includes an active intervention. it is expected that, to the greatest extent possible, identical interventions (e.g., the same pharmacological compounds, or comparably patterned electrical stimulation in model animals and humans) and tasks (e.g., equivalent working memory tasks) will be used. a related question of interest is whether any existing or novel medications are able to modify neural coordination patterns, and whether this mediates any improvement in cognition, affect, or social interaction.topic 4: computational modelingdevelop a biologically realistic computational model to allow a principled understanding of the algorithms and mechanisms by which neural coordination patterns across brain areas affect cognitive, affective, and social processing. the computational models can cross levels, such as from the biophysical level to circuit-level emergent properties, and they can also be top-down, such as mathematically describing and manipulating higher-order parameters of oscillatory coordination in relation to information processing and behavioral output. projects that address the topic of computational modeling should also include electrophysiological recordings in animals or in humans and implement causal manipulations to improve cognitive, affective, or social processing. the experimental and computational modeling should be mutually informative.there are two goals within this topic. one goal is to reach a mechanistic understanding of how rhythmic patterns support information processing in the brain in the service of cognitive, affective, and social processing, and, relatedly, what algorithms are being implemented in the brain for each type of processing, including, but not limited to, spatial navigation, non-spatial relational processing (e.g., transitive inference), manipulation of items in working memory, social interaction, emotion regulation, decision making, and other domains of function. a second goal is to understand how modifying a neural pattern in one region of the network affects the patterns in other brain regions. this work can include modeling how brain stimulation at one location might affect oscillations and information processing in other brain regions. the purpose is to understand network-level ramifications of local changes in oscillatory dynamics. applications can address one or more of these goals.this foa seeks to generate a mechanistic understanding of what aspects of neural coordination and patterning can be modified to improve cognitive, affective, and social processing. these findings are expected to eventually support the development of pharmacological, electrical, magnetic, or other types of interventions that can enhance cognitive, affective, or social processing sufficiently to improve real-life functioning for patients.examples of research topics include, but are not limited to:regardless of topic, all projects must:applications not
