applications assigned to those institutes/centers.office of behavioral and social sciences research (obssr)office of research on women's health (orwh)the office of disease prevention and participating icos are issuing this notice to highlight our interest in encouraging highly innovative and promising translational research to improve our understanding of how to increase and maintain health-enhancing physical activity using multi-level interventions in a wide range of population groups across the lifespan (e.g., including racial and ethnic minorities, children, older adults, persons with medical/behavioral health conditions, and persons with disabilities). this includes efficacy, effectiveness and dissemination and implementation studies. it also includes support for pilot, exploratory, or developmental work in preparation for full-scale, fully powered efficacy studies, preliminary feasibility studies, as well as expanded feasibility work for a discrete, specified, circumscribed project that is based on well-established theory, existing data and evidence-based interventions.background:physical activity is an important health behavior that is associated with numerous health conditions and outcomes. the evidence reviewed for the 2018 edition of the physical activity guidelines for americans indicates physical activity fosters normal growth and development, can make people feel better, function better, sleep better, and reduces the risk of a large number of chronic diseases. the evidence about the health benefits of regular physical activity is well established. yet, according to the guidelines and the healthy people 2030 overview on physical activity, “only 1 in 4 adults and 1 in 5 adolescents in the united states meet physical activity guidelines for aerobic and muscle-strengthening activities.” the u.s. global burden of disease collaborators (2018) note physical inactivity as a leading risk factor associated with morbidity and mortality in the united states. the center for disease control's community preventive services task force issued a number of insufficient evidence statements and positive recommendations that highlight future research needs for physical activity programs that target schools, families, workplaces, and built environments.reductions in daily physical activity caused by poor sleep quality, stay-at-home mandates issued for public health emergencies, or improper nutrition, for example, highlight the need for physical activity research focused on both intervention development and intervention testing that bridges basic and applied science. furthermore, insights from basic research can potentially be used to identify more effective, efficient, and sustainable interventions for improving overall physical activity-related behavior and health changes. current evidence indicates that integrated physical activity interventions aimed at several levels, consistent with socio-ecological models, may be effective to get people moving, both at the individual and community level. higher chances of sustaining healthy physical activity-related behavior occur when an ecological approach is integrated in the prevention strategy.socioecological models and frameworks, including the nimhd minority health and health disparities research framework and the nia health disparities research framework, offer a systematic approach by which population-specific determinants for overall physical health and well-being can be identified, measured, operationalized, and analyzed. implementation research frameworks, such as consolidated framework for implementation research (cfir); promoting action on research implementation in health services (parihs); or reach effectiveness adoption implementation maintenance (re-aim) have been used to describe, guide, or inform key implementation processes and determinants. rigorous research study designs (e.g., experimental, quasi-experimental, observational, modeling, cluster randomization, stepped-wedge, type iii hybrid effectiveness, etc.), also offer tremendous benefit in multi-level intervention studies. the nih stage model offers a framework for considering when an intervention is ready for widespread implementation and emphasizes attention to the principles or mechanisms of action – at any level of analysis – that account for an intervention’s effects.research objectives:this notice encourages translational research aimed at developing or testing multi-level physical activity interventions to improve health and well-being. for the purpose of this nosi, multi-level is defined as having an effect on at least two levels of influence. at minimum, the proposed study must:for example, an intervention might focus on incorporating components of a healthy diet in combination with increasing physical activity at a school or workplace. likewise, an intervention might include technology-based challenges at the interpersonal level, as well as the initiation/strengthening of joint-use agreements for community members to use recreation facilities at the public policy level. a different intervention might focus on methods for enhancing motivation at the intrapersonal level and creating online social support groups for physical activity at the interpersonal level. policy or built environmental intervention across worksites at an organizational level may be paired with individually targeted intervention components to promote physical activity. studies proposing to address multi-level interventions can include experimental designs or natural experiments created by changes in policy. intervention settings can include, but are not limited to, healthcare settings, worksites, households, schools, green space, parks and recreation centers, other community organizations and settings, or entire communities.this nosi seeks research for all developmental stages, across the lifespan, and in diverse populations, particularly those at high risk for sedentary behavior, those at high risk for disease conditions associated with inactivity, and those at risk for food insecurity. populations of interest include, but are not limited to:this nosi encourages feasibility and pilot research, as well as efficacy and effectiveness research on new or adapted interventions. to maximize comparisons across datasets or studies, and facilitate data integration and collaboration, researchers funded through this nosi are encouraged to use the following resource:investigators who conduct original and innovative basic biomedical, social, behavioral, clinical, or population-based research directed toward eliminating health disparities are invited to apply to this nosi. research shows that diverse teams working together outperform homogenous teams. scientists and trainees from diverse backgrounds and with different life experiences bring different perspectives, creativity, and individual enterprise to address complex scientific problems. diverse teams of scientists will lead the way to develop more innovative inclusive research that will more broadly enhance public health. fostering diversity by addressing underrepresentation in the scientific research workforce is a key component of the nih strategy to identify, develop, support, and maintain the quality of our scientific workforce. it is expected that research programs will include a diverse group of scientists, including individuals from underrepresented backgrounds as per not od 20-031 (notice of nih's interest in diversity).study designdesign, analysis, and sample size considerations for studies to evaluate interventions:investigators seeking to evaluate the effect of an intervention on a health-related biomedical or behavioral outcome may propose a study design in which groups subjected to the intervention are compared to groups that are exposed to an appropriate comparison condition. the comparison condition should be justified based on the state-of-the-science for the intervention and the nature of the research question. designs that might be proposed for studies that randomize groups or deliver interventions to groups include parallel group- or cluster-randomized trials, stepped-wedge group- or cluster- randomized trials, multiple baseline designs, and another quasi-experimental designs. whenever participants are assigned in groups or clusters (e.g., families, clinics, schools, worksites, communities, counties, states), or participants receive some part of their intervention in a group or cluster, and observations on individual participants are analyzed for between-group effects, special methods are required for analysis and sample size. applicants will need to show that their methods are appropriate given their plans for assignment of participants and delivery of interventions. additional information is available at https://researchmethodsresources.nih.gov/.applications nonresponsive to terms of this nosi will be withdrawn from consideration for this initiative. the following types of projects would generally not be appropriate and may be deemed non-responsive:investigators must carefully review the specific research interests of nih institutes and centers that are participating in this nosi.ic specific

sf424 (r&r) application guide and the listed funding opportunity announcements must be followed, with the following additions:national cancer institute (nci)the national cancer institute is interested in applications of multi-level physical activity interventions that have implications for outcomes across the cancer continuum and that have the potential for adoption, implementation, and sustainability in real-world settings.the proposed intervention must include physical activity change as a primary endpoint and be designed to test statistically significant differences in the outcome based on the intervention over a one or more-year intervention period. secondary outcomes of interest include: implementation feasibility information, prevention of secondary conditions (such as obesity, decrement in skeletal muscle strength and functioning, aerobic fitness, or decline in bone health) and related biomarkers of health, amelioration of persistent post-cancer treatment conditions or toxicities affecting physical and cognitive function. where inclusion of obesity as secondary outcome occurs, the intervention should principally aim to improve physical activity or reduce sedentary behavior and include rationale for health benefit independent of weight loss.nci’s foas for this nosi include the following or their subsequent reissued equivalents:activity

priorities and is aligned with these recommended areas for domestic and global mental health research. hiv-related applications to nimh will not be considered responsive. appropriate topics include, but are not limited to studies mentioned below:intervention and services researchfor research on the effectiveness of interventions or services, nimh supports studies that employ an experimental therapeutics approach, whereby clinical trials are designed not only to test the intervention effects on mental health and/or physical health outcomes of interest, but also to inform understanding of the intervention’s mechanisms of action. as such, applications that propose to develop and/or test the efficacy/effectiveness of preventive, therapeutic or services interventions must include specification of the intervention target(s)/mechanism(s) and assessment of intervention-induced changes in the presumed target mechanism(s) that are hypothesized to account for the intervention outcome. in the case of services interventions, targets/mechanisms might involve mutable service user or provider behaviors, or organizational/system-level factors that are intervened upon in order to improve access, continuity, quality, equity, and/or value of services. studies adapting existing preventive, therapeutic or services interventions to specifically target certain populations, e.g., by racial or ethnic identity or lgbtq+ status, should provide a justification for the unique targets to be tested. see the support for clinical trials at nimh web page for additional information regarding dedicated funding opportunity announcements (foas) for nimh clinical trials research support.preventive interventionsall studies on preventive interventions should include mental health outcomes as a primary outcome.treatment interventionsall studies on treatment interventions should include mental health outcomes as a primary outcomeservices interventionsnimh encourages services research on practical strategies for preventing and/or reducing the common modifiable health risks that contribute to heart disease, diabetes, cancer, stroke, and pulmonary disease in people with serious mental illness (smi) and lead to their premature mortality. research that addresses (1) service delivery strategies for the recognition, management and treatment of common modifiable health risks, which include low physical activity and poor fitness, as well as obesity, smoking, hypertension, metabolic disorder, substance use, and diet, and (2) increasing access to evidence-based interventions that address these health risks in people with smi, and intervention adaptations that may be needed for effectiveness in people with smi, is encouraged. this research may focus on adults with smi and/or children and youth with serious emotional disturbance (sed) and should include physical health as a primary outcome; inclusion of other common modifiable health risks associated with premature mortality in people with smi as primary or secondary outcomes is encouraged.research areas of interest to nimh include but are not limited to the following:nimh’s foas for this nosi include

interventions for health disparity populations that are deliverable and sustainable at settings where these populations live, work, play or receive health care. intervention design should be based on theories from minority health and health disparities science. research projects must focus primarily on one or more health disparity population (african americans/blacks, hispanics/latinos, american indians/alaska natives, asian americans, native hawaiians and other pacific islanders, socioeconomically disadvantaged populations, underserved rural populations, and sexual and gender minority populations). comparison groups or populations may be included as appropriate for the research questions posed. settings of interest include but are not limited to low-resourced urban neighborhoods and communities, rural communities, small municipalities, and/or delivered within health care settings for medically underserved, e.g., federally qualified health centers (fqhcs) or tribal healthcare centers or with disparity populations within any health care system. nimhd is interested in interventions that include components that address the neighborhood social environment (e.g., social cohesion, social capital, collective efficacy, community resilience), structural barriers and facilitators (e.g., neighborhood safety, safe paths for walking), or strategies that mitigate against unintended policy level consequences (e.g., displacement of persons with low ses due to gentrification). nimhd is also interested in novel behavior change strategies that target decision making processes (impulsive/executive decision systems) to follow through with healthy choices under conditions of high stressors (e.g., poverty, discrimination, or financial insecurity), incorporating cultural resiliency and protective factors and culturally tailored interventions and/or technology. for multi-levels and domains of interest refer to the nimhd research framework,
