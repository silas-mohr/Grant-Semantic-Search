national institutes of health (nih)national institute on alcohol abuse and alcoholism (niaaa)r21/r33 phased innovation awardsee notices of special interest associated with this funding opportunitysee section iii. 3. additional information on eligibility.this funding opportunity announcement (foa) focuses on sensitivity and tolerance mechanisms underlying the development of alcohol use disorder. the intent of this foa is to: (1) develop hypotheses about cellular, molecular or network mechanisms that regulate sensitivity and tolerance to alcohol, and (2) develop quantitative models to predict the development of tolerance and the progression to alcohol use disorder. these objectives will be accomplished with a phased innovation (r21/r33) mechanism, clinical trial optional, in which secondary data analysis or pilot studies can occur during the r21 phase, and research testing the hypotheses can be expanded in the r33 phase. the transition to the r33 phase will be determined by niaaa program staff after evaluation of the achievement of specific milestones set for the r21 phase.not applicableall applications are due by 5:00 pm local time of applicant organization. all types of non-aids applications allowed for this funding opportunity announcement are due on the listed date(s).applicants are encouraged to apply early to allow adequate time to make any corrections to

options to access the application forms for this opportunity.backgroundwhile many americans imbibe in alcoholic beverages, for some, drinking becomes problematic, potentially leading to an alcohol use disorder (aud). the response to the initial alcohol experiences, sometimes known as sensitivity, may predict aud later in life. low sensitivity is associated with high probability of developing an aud. following initial exposure, responses to alcohol change with subsequent drinking. alcohol tolerance is a complex phenomenon in which increased alcohol intake is required to achieve a given effect, e.g., the feeling of intoxication, and is a defining feature of aud. stated in another way, tolerance decreases the effect of a defined alcohol dose. alcohol sensitivity and tolerance vary in the population, yet, research on underlying mechanisms is sparse and findings are disparate. experimental subjects vary in age, sex, racial or ethnic background, previous alcohol exposure, drinking context and genetics. response variables are often subjective, while objective measures are not comparable between studies. the goal of this foa is to build a framework for the systematic analysis of the factors that contribute to alcohol sensitivity and tolerance and the mechanisms that regulate tolerance and transition to aud.in contrast to the scarcity of studies directly addressing mechanisms of tolerance, there is an abundance of behavioral and physiological data from subjects with aud, and thus alcohol tolerance. clinical studies include retrospective data regarding the need to increase the number of drinks over time for the same effect. the clinical studies usually focus on the withdrawal, relapse, and re-instatement phases of aud, but the same models and data can inform tolerance and progression to aud.the physiological nature of tolerance has been classified as either metabolic or functional. metabolic tolerance describes changes in efficiency or capacity to metabolize ethanol resulting in a decrease in the blood alcohol concentration following a given dose of alcohol.functional tolerance refers to lessened response to alcohol independent of the rate of metabolism of alcohol.little is known about the interplay between metabolic and functional tolerance, as many of the molecules that metabolize alcohol in the liver are expressed in the nervous system.functional tolerance is further defined based upon the duration of alcohol exposure.different time frames for the forms of tolerance suggest separate underlying mechanisms. tolerance diminishes after periods of abstinence, and thus, an individual may experience multiple episodes of tolerance. the dependence of the alcohol responses on previous periods of alcohol exposure, context(s), and abstinence has not been systematically studied under the framework of tolerance, nor have relationships between acute, rapid or chronic tolerance been well studied. it is unknown whether the common mechanisms mediate multiple forms of tolerance.sensitivity and tolerance are assessed by multiple methods. for human subjects, measurements include self-reported number of drinks to achieve intoxication, cortisol levels, or electrophysiological changes. brain imaging studies have combined blood (or breath) alcohol concentration with self-reported assessment of intoxication, performance on cognitive and memory tasks with blood oxygen level-dependent response and functional connectivity measures. recent studies of tolerance measured drinking and blood alcohol concentrations in complex motor and cognitive tasks, such as driving simulators.the development of tolerance requires a compensatory response. behavioral tolerance describes tolerance in response to specific cues. thus, an individual or research subject may exhibit tolerance to alcohol in one context (i.e. bar), but not in another (i.e. workplace). the repeated pairing of the situational cues with alcohol represents pavlovian conditioning. with behavioral tolerance, the cues alone can elicit the compensatory response, and the tolerance can be extinguished after repeated presentation of cues in absence of alcohol. behavioral tolerance contributes to the dependence, withdrawal, and abstinence phases of aud.alcohol responses and tolerance capacity vary widely among humans and are influenced by multiple factors, including genetics, sex, race/ethnicity, behavioral context, and age. a spectrum of responses is observed, yet the underlying mechanisms for individual variability are not known. drinking patterns of individual subjects within a cohort are not reported, but rather the mean and variance. however, the blood alcohol concentration is often measured and correlated with alcohol intake on an individual basis, providing an indication of variability within the study population. similarly, self-report surveys highlight drinking patterns (or maximum number of drinks per day) and analyze individual perception of intoxication, but often the reports are not accompanied by objective measurements of functional outcomes or genetic variation. in summary, individual differences in the research subjects and the measurements of response and tolerance have been overlooked, and the translation and interpretation of the results do not converge into common mechanisms and neural circuits.specific areas of research interestthis foa encourages studies that identify the mechanisms of sensitivity and tolerance in aud in relation to other variables (e. g. sex, behavioral context, age) through an r21/r33 mechanism. the r21 phase is the first two (2) years of the application, while the r33 spans the following three (3) years.there is little convergence of published parameters, drinking models and patterns, and assessment paradigms. the r21 phase supports re-analysis of data from human experimental paradigms leading to aud, with the goal of developing new hypotheses and common experimental framework(s) to characterize the sensitivity and tolerance (including individual variations). while tolerance may not have been the goal of the previous research, measurements of blood alcohol concentrations, in addition to the behavioral or physiological measurements, may provide insight into the mechanisms of tolerance. re-analysis of these data and new pilot studies, through the lens of understanding sensitivity and tolerance, have the potential to provide preliminary data to develop and test new hypotheses about the roles of sensitivity and tolerance in auds in the r33 phase. topics include, but are not limited to, the following:milestonesstudies are encouraged to use existing data from one or more principal investigators to develop hypotheses of the roles of sensitivity and tolerance in aud. projects should include the following:the objectives for the r33 phase should be based on the findings from the r21 phase. examples of the goals for the r33 phase include, but are not limited to:design, analysis, and sample size for studies to evaluate group-based interventions: investigators who wish to evaluate the effect of an intervention on a health-related biomedical or behavioral outcome may propose a study in which (1) groups or clusters are assigned to study arms and individual observations are analyzed to evaluate the effect of the intervention, or (2) participants are assigned individually to study arms but receive at least some of their intervention in a real or virtual group or through a shared facilitator. such studies may propose a parallel group- or cluster-randomized trial, an individually randomized group-treatment trial, a stepped-wedge design, or a quasi-experimental version of one of these designs. in these studies, special methods may be warranted for analysis and sample size estimation. applicants should show that their methods are appropriate given their plans for assignment of participants and delivery of interventions. additional information is available at https://researchmethodsresources.nih.gov/.note on niaaa's interest in diversityresearch shows that diverse teams working together outperform homogenous teams. scientists and trainees from diverse backgrounds and with different life experiences bring different perspectives, creativity, and individual enterprise to address complex scientific problems. diverse teams of scientists will lead the way to develop more innovative inclusive research that will more broadly enhance public health. fostering diversity by addressing underrepresentation in the scientific research workforce is a key component of the nih strategy to identify, develop, support, and maintain the quality of our scientific workforce. it is expected that the research program will include a diverse group of scientists, including individuals from underrepresented backgrounds as per not od 20-031 (notice of nih's interest in diversity). niaaa is especially interested in enhancing representation from racial, ethnic and gender minorities and early-stage investigators.applications not responsive to this foaapplications on the following topics will not be considered responsive to
