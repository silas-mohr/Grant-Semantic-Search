2022see section iii. 3. additional information on eligibility.the goal of this funding opportunity announcement (foa) is to identify, in animals, in vivo neurophysiological and behavioral measures for use as assays in the early screening phase of treatment development. this foa will support efforts to optimize and evaluate measures of neurophysiological and behavioral processes that may serve as pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (pk/pd) markers of neural processes of clinical interest based on available knowledge of the neurobiology of mental illnesses. the screening assays developed from this foa are expected to build upon systems neurobiology and clinical neuroscience to enhance the scientific value of preclinical animal data contributing to a therapeutic development pipeline in which treatment candidates and therapeutic targets can be evaluated for their ability to impact neurobiological mechanisms of potential clinical relevance to mental illnesses.the objectives of this foa will be accomplished by supporting basic neuroscience aimed at improving the efficiency and scientific value of the therapeutic development pipeline by advancing the discovery of in vivo physiological and behavioral measures reflecting circuit engagement as tools for early phase target validation and therapeutic screening for mental illness treatment development. the efforts supported by this initiative focus on measures in animals as a first step in generating translational assay measures that are adaptable across early therapeutic screens in animals to evaluation in humans. the foa may be considered a prequel to build a suite of assays that are evaluated in future projects for coherence of assay performance between the preclinical species and healthy humans. in summary, this foa will support efforts to improve the tool kit of assays available for early phase testing of novel therapeutic agents by incorporating measures proximal to neural systems that impact mental health.not

options to access the application forms for this opportunity.background and research objectivesdespite large investments by pharmaceutical and biotech industries, the last 20 years have yielded few novel treatments to address unmet needs of individuals suffering with mental illnesses. multiple factors have contributed to the low success rate, including insufficient understanding of disease pathophysiology and the basis for heterogeneity in presentation and treatment response of patients within categorical diagnoses. the nimh supports efforts such as the research domains criteria (rdoc) project to transform diagnostics by promoting research that extends beyond the current symptom-based diagnostic categories (i.e., diagnostic and statistical manual, dsm) to identify functional domains whose disruption contributes significantly to disability across diagnoses. however, rdoc was designed to provide a context to examine functional domains and relevant neurobiology in humans, not in animals. while clinical neuroscience advances our understanding of circuit disruptions driving behavioral deficits in humans, the need for comparable efforts in basic neuroscience has become evident, particularly across the therapeutic development pipeline where behavioral screens in animals often contribute to the selection of lead candidates for the development of novel treatments for mental illnesses. the goal of this foa is to address this gap by supporting the initial development and testing of innovative neurophysiological and behavioral measures that have the potential to serve as translational screening assays in preclinical species.the poor predictive value of current preclinical screening model systems in therapeutic development for neurological and mental disorders is well recognized by the pharmaceutical industry and was the topic of a high profile workshop (see national academies of sciences, engineering and medicine report, therapeutic development in the absence of predictive animal models of nervous system disorders: proceedings of a workshop). commonly used batteries of behavioral assays in rodents such as the forced swim test, tail suspension test, elevated plus maze, novelty induced suppression of feeding, sucrose preference, open field activity test, and reversal of drug-induced hyperlocomotion or grooming are useful in some contexts, such as addressing effects of novel ligands on brain penetrance and dose response. however, these measures do not reflect specific neural processes or predict efficacy. relationships between these measures in animals and behavioral deficits or neural activity irregularities in patients is unknown.technical advances in neuroscience, including those generated through the brain research through advancing innovative neurotechnologies (brain) initiative, now provide tremendous opportunities to understand the functional impact of cell and circuit diversity and identify novel therapeutic targets. still, while the neurobiology underlying target identification has advanced, neuroscience-based approaches to screen potential targets and treatment candidates in the therapeutic development pipeline have not kept pace. the current foa is built on the premise that it is possible to develop neurophysiological and behavioral measures in animals that mirror a subset of brain activities and functional domains suggested by clinical neuroscience to impact mental health and disability, here defined as potentially “clinically relevant”. to advance such measures as assays for treatment development, this foa encourages applications aimed at addressing three specific goals; 1) identification and optimization of measures that reflect clinically relevant brain processes that are potentially conserved between preclinical species and humans, 2) evaluation of the sensitivity and selectivity of the potential measures as screening assays by examining their performance in response to perturbations such as drugs, and 3) testing the role of the brain pathways hypothesized to underlie the physiological and/or behavioral assay measure. completion of these goals is expected to unveil novel, research-based physiological and/or behavioral assays that are poised for cross validation against results of similar measures in humans and then potential use as preclinical assay measures in a treatment development pipeline for mental illnesses. thus, while human testing is not a component of this foa, the measures to be developed in animals through this foa should be designed so the coherence, or lack of concurrence, of the assay performance across species to humans can be assessed in future projects. in this way, assays developed here may be considered the preclinical prequel to subsequent projects aimed at evaluating the assays for coherence of performance between the preclinical species and healthy humans.research scopethe foa supports the initial stages in the development, optimization, and evaluation of novel in vivo measures as potential assays in early (pre-first in human) screening of therapeutic candidates. assays may include neurophysiological measures and may include behavioral measures. key considerations are listed below but at a minimum, measures should be amenable to study in live animals and in future studies in humans, and they must be innovative.priority will be given to applications that include all three of the following phases:this foa aims to stimulate the development of in vivo assays to address translational gaps in treatment development for mental illnesses. support will be provided for assay development efforts in animals that propose quantitative measures of neurophysiological and/or behavioral processes where there is reasonable evidence to suggest that measure is a potential contributor to functional deficits of individuals with mental illnesses (e.g., cognitive function, impulsivity, motivation, etc.).examples of relevant neurophysiological and/or behavioral measures for development and evaluation as assays include, but are not limited to:mechanistic testing of underlying brain pathways will be tailored to the proposed assay measure. for example, studies might examine whether specific changes in dopamine signaling to striatum or prefrontal cortex reliably predict speed or accuracy of reward contingency learning. these studies are critical for advancing a new generation of in vivo assays for therapeutic development that are grounded in a clinically-meaningful neurobiological context.the main emphasis must be on developing novel, clinically relevant measures as assays. while the neurophysiological or behavioral measures may not be innovative by themselves, their inclusion in a therapeutic development pipeline must be novel.since this work is expected to identify and optimize novel assay measures that can subsequently be compared with measures in healthy humans, proposed neurophysiological and behavioral assay measures should have analogs that can be performed in healthy humans.while neurophysiological measures such as event-related potential (erp) may be useful for refining critical temporal parameters of an assay, they have insufficient specificity to assess effects across trials. studies proposing eeg measures as assays should focus on frequency band measures for this foa.measures should be innovative in relation to published relevant literature. for example, assays of plasticity mechanisms could focus on novel neurophysiological measures. many behavioral readouts of learning and memory are well established and already sufficiently represented in the nimh portfolio, particularly for contextual versus cued fear learning.applications not responsive to this foathe following will be considered not responsive and will not be reviewed:milestonesall projects must propose a timeline for completion of the required components of assay development, including (1) assay measure optimization, (2) evaluation of assay performance, and (3) mechanistic testing. if more than one measure is proposed for optimization, the timeline must include plans for optimization of each measure. an additional milestone should outline plans and a timeline for dissemination of results, regardless of outcome.potential applicants are strongly encouraged to read the
