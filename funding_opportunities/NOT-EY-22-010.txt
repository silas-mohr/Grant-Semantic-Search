currently, there are limited at-home testing options that people with visual impairment can use independently. existing test kits do not provide instructions in braille, large text, or audio formats. the interaction with the test requires precise visuomotor dexterity to insert the sample. interpreting the results relies on low-contrast visual cues, often using colors to convey information. although technologies exist for other diagnostics to deliver information by tactile means, sars-cov-2 tests do not.this nosi encourages researchers to leverage existing partnerships and build new partnerships with key stakeholders to develop and implement specific, targeted approaches for home-based testing strategies for people with visual impairment. strategies should be scalable, sustainable, and consider the multiple stakeholders (e.g., visually impaired, blind children, adults with low vision, older adults, parents/guardians, caregivers).key issues to be addressed include but are not limited to:determining appropriate testing approaches (surveillance, screening, and/or diagnostic testing) for people who are visually impairedreducing barriers to home -testing and establishing testing strategies suitable for people who are visually impaireddeveloping new technologies to address current limitationsapplication and submission informationthis notice applies to due dates on or after march 7, 2022, and subsequent receipt dates through march 9, 2024.submit applications for this initiative using one of the following funding opportunity announcements (foas) or any reissues of these announcements through the expiration date of this notice.pa-20-184 research project grant (parent r01 basic experimental studies with humans required)pa-20-185 nih research project grant (parent r01 clinical trial not allowed)pa-20-195 nih exploratory/developmental research project grant (parent r21 clinical trial not allowed)pa-20-196 nih exploratory/developmental research grant program (parent r21 basic experimental studies with humans required)par-22-060 research enhancement award program (reap) for health professional schools and graduate schools (r15 clinical trial not allowed)par-21-155 academic research enhancement award for undergraduate-focused institutions (r15 clinical trial not allowed)pa-21-259 small business innovation research (sbir) (omnibus/parent r43/r44 clinical trial not allowed)pa-21-260 small business innovation research grant applications (parent sbir [r43/r44] clinical trial required)pa-21-261 small business technology transfer grant applications (parent sttr [r41/r42] clinical trial required)pa-21-262 small business technology transfer (sttr) (omnibus/parent r41/r42 clinical trial not allowed)pa-20-272 administrative supplements to existing nih grants and cooperative agreements (parent admin supp clinical trial optional)pa-21-071 research supplements to promote diversity in health-related research (admin supp - clinical trial not allowed)all instructions in the sf424 (r&r) application guide and the funding opportunity announcement used for submission must be followed, with the following additions:applications nonresponsive to terms of this nosi will not be considered for the nosi initiative.scientific/research contact(s)sangeeta bhargava, ph.d national eye institute (nei) telephone: 301-435-8175 email: sangeeta.bhargava@nih.govweekly toc for this announcement nih funding opportunities and noticesnote: for help accessing pdf, rtf, ms word, excel, powerpoint, audio or video files, see help downloading files.
