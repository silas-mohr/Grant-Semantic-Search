(nimhd)backgroundas of 2019, suicide was the fifth leading cause of death for children ages 5-12. while still relatively rare, the death of a child by suicide is a devastating event and can have long-lasting effects on families, schools, medical providers, and communities. in addition, suicide rates for children have been increasing over time, especially for some subgroups such as black youth. despite these concerning trends, little is known about how to assess the presence and severity of stb among younger children. in the fy2022 house appropriations report (h. rept. 117-96), congress encouraged nimh to continue to prioritize suicide research in fiscal year 2022. in 2021 nimh convened a four-part virtual research roundtable series, “risk, resilience, & trajectories in preteen suicide.” three topical roundtables culminated in a synthesis meeting and brought together a diverse group of expert panelists to assess the state of the science and short- and longer-term research priorities related to child/preteen suicide risk and risk trajectories. presentations and discussions among round table participants highlighted the importance of using developmentally and culturally sensitive suicide risk assessment approaches and suggested that the measures and methods used to assess stb in adolescents and adults need to be reconsidered and adapted for this younger population.research objectivesthe purpose of this notice of special interest (nosi) is to encourage research focused on informing or refining developmentally and culturally sensitive approaches for assessing suicide thoughts and behaviors (stb) among children and preteens (defined here as 12-years-old and younger). supplement applications are encouraged from currently funded projects with infrastructure that can be readily leveraged to inform the development or refinement of developmentally and culturally sensitive approaches for assessing suicide thoughts and behaviors (stb) among children and preteens.examples of projects that might be candidates for supplement activities include:the application should define and justify the age focus and sampling strategy of the proposed research in terms of the level of suicide risk and research question (e.g., characterizing youths’ understanding of the permanence of death, operationalizing the frequency/intensity/duration of ideation, characterizing potentially suicidal behavior). applications that consider issues relevant to the assessment of diverse youth are encouraged including those focused on the acceptability and cultural relevance of the strategies for assessment among youth from minoritized backgrounds.given the importance of considering youths’ developmental status (e.g., cognitive functioning as it relates to their understanding of death and participation in the assessment) and the importance of assessing youths’ internal states, applicants are encouraged to bring together teams with strong expertise in developmental science and propose projects that directly assess respondents’ comprehension of interview/survey items and the developmental appropriateness of potential assessment approaches. investigator teams are also expected to include expertise in suicide risk assessment and conceptualization and expertise in measure development and psychometrics, as appropriate. applicants may choose to utilize mixed method approaches (e.g., cognitive interviewing approaches to assess the young respondents’ comprehension of proposed questionnaire/interview items). in these instances, applicants should specify how the proposed methods are consistent with established standards of rigor for quantitative and qualitative data collection and analysis. examples of responsive administrative supplement applications include but are not limited to projects that:applications should clearly address the following:areas that are lower priority for this nosi include:national institute on minority health and health disparities (nimhd) the mission of nimhd is to lead scientific research to improve minority health and reduce health disparities. populations that experience health disparities include african americans/blacks, hispanic/latinos, american indians/alaska natives, asians, native hawaiians, and other pacific islanders, socioeconomically disadvantaged populations, underserved rural populations, and sexual and gender minority (sgm) populations. in the context of this nosi, nimhd is especially interested in the innovative application of community-engaged approaches and utilization of the nimhd research framework to examine and assess suicide and stb among african american/black children, american indian and alaska native children, sgm children, and children of mixed race/ethnicity across multiple levels of influence (i.e., individual, community, societal).examples of potential topic areas include but are not limited to:note that relevent new research project grant applications utilizing the r21 exploratory/developmental research grant mechanism are encouraged through not-mh-22-086.application and submission informationapplications for
