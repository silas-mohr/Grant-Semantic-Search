is to inform potential applicants of the nih’s interest in supporting research on interventions designed to change the culture to mitigate or eliminate sexual harassment in the biomedical research enterprise. this notice aligns with the anti-sexual harassment policy statements released by nih as well as recommendations made in the december 2019 report from the working group to the advisory committee to the nih director (acd) on changing the culture to end sexual harassment, which were endorsed by the acd.backgroundthe cumulative effect of sexual harassment has a significant devastating and costly impact on individuals and the nation. the loss of talent has consequences for advancing the nation's economic and social well-being and its overall public health, as well as damaging costs to the individuals and their families. the costs to individuals and institutions are considerable. the abused may face the loss of a job, promotion, or privileges if they refuse the harasser. the unwelcome advances can create a hostile workplace such that the individual may feel the need to leave a position or career. additionally, harassment contributes to an unsettled situation for those who are not directly involved but who have regular interactions with both the target and harasser. there are emotional, physical, mental, and legal consequences, which may have a direct impact on individual performance and career advancement, as well as social and fiscal impacts on the institutional setting, students, and co-workers.the national academies of sciences, engineering, and medicine (nasem) report, sexual harassment of women: climate, culture, and consequences in academic sciences, engineering, and medicine, demonstrates the urgent need to develop new partnerships to address this challenging problem. a 2003 meta-analysis found that 58 percent of women in academia faced sexually harassing behavior. a report on sexual assault reports that 63% of sexual assaults are not reported, with false reports being as low as 2 – 10 percent. the nasem study found that the most prevalent risk factor for sexual harassment is related to institutional culture or climate of tolerance.this systemic problem will require a long-term change in the culture of the scientific enterprise, the behavior of scientists and administrators, and perhaps a fundamental restructuring of the research environment. trainees (students, postdoctoral fellows, medical residents, and clinical fellows), early-career faculty, and foreign scientists deserve special attention due to power differentials, career-stage vulnerability, and residency considerations.research objectivesthe nih is encouraging applications to test interventions aiming to lessen or eliminate sexual harassment in the biomedical research enterprise. the objective of this notice is to invite applications associated with par-21-269 “research on interventions that promote the research careers of individual in the biomedical research enterprise (r01 – clinical trial not allowed)”. the foa encourages the use of evidence-based practices and recognizes the need for more hypothesis-driven research to test biomedical training, mentoring, and networking interventions for efficacy and replicability across career stages and at a range of institution types to provide insights into the factors contributing to success. through this funding announcement, nih intends to enhance the evidence base for effective, high-impact, scalable interventions that will improve the understanding of the factors contributing to success, including the social and behavioral factors involved in the advancement of individuals pursuing independent academic biomedical research careers.this notice emphasizes an interest in a broad range of studies providing generalizable and reproducible results regarding interventions to mitigate and eliminate sexual harassment in the biomedical research workforce. nih defines sexual harassment as “a form of harassment that violates title vii of the civil rights act of 1964. unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature constitute sexual harassment when this conduct explicitly or implicitly affects an individual's employment, unreasonably interferes with an individual's work performance, or creates an intimidating, hostile, or offensive work environment.” examples of harassing and threatening conditions or behaviors include, but are not limited to:the nih is encouraging the community to develop interventions to help mitigate this risk.studies testing interventions in this context may include, but are not limited, to the following:there remains a clear need for research on the methods used to study sexual harassment in the biomedical research workforce, e.g. are they sufficient, inclusive, and reliable? investigators interested in the development of models, analytical tools, data, and metrics that can inform science policy, the optimization of the scientific enterprise, the advancement of the scientific basis of science innovation and implementation policy should consider the science of science policy approach to analyzing and innovating the biomedical research enterprise (scisipbio) program jointly sponsored by the national institute on general medical sciences (nigms) and the national science foundation (nsf).note: applications proposing/describing projects involving and/or conducting research on animals are not appropriate for this funding opportunity. also, applications
