with the transformative, breakthrough neuroscience discoveries supported through the brain initiative.30 days prior to the application due datesall applications are due by 5:00 pm local time of applicant organization. all types of non-aids applications allowed for this funding opportunity announcement are due on the listed date(s).applicants are encouraged to apply early to allow adequate time to make any corrections to errors found in the application during the submission process by the due date.not applicableit is critical that applicants follow the instructions in the research (r) instructions in the sf424 (r&r) application guide,except where instructed to do otherwise (in this foa or in a notice from nih guide for grants and contracts ).conformance to all requirements (both in the application guide and the foa) is required and strictly enforced. applicants must read and follow all application instructions in the application guide as well as any program-specific instructions noted in section iv. when the program-specific instructions deviate from those in the application guide, follow the program-specific instructions.applications that do not comply with these

you must use one of these submission options to access the application forms for this opportunity.since 2014, the brain research through advancing innovative neurotechnologies® (brain) initiative has aimed to accelerate the development and application of innovative neurotechnologies, enabling researchers to produce a new dynamic picture of the brain that reveals how individual cells and complex neural circuits interact in both time and space. it is expected that these advances will ultimately lead to new ways to treat and prevent brain disorders.as one of several federal agencies involved in the brain initiative, nih's contributions to the brain initiative were initially guided by "brain 2025: a scientific vision," a strategic plan that detailed seven high-priority research areas. this plan was updated and enhanced in 2019 by: "the brain initiative 2.0: from cells to circuits, toward cures" and "the brain initiative and neuroethics: enabling and enhancing neuroscience advances for society." this and other brain initiative funding opportunity announcements (foas) are based on this vision and issued with input from advisory councils of the 10 nih institutes and centers supporting the brain initiative, as assisted by the nih brain multi-council working group.the nih brain initiative recognizes that diverse teams working together and capitalizing on innovative ideas and distinct perspectives outperform homogeneous teams. there are many benefits that flow from a diverse scientific workforce, including: fostering scientific innovation, enhancing global competitiveness, contributing to robust learning environments, improving the quality of the research, advancing the likelihood that underserved populations participate in, and benefit from research, and enhancing public trust.to support the best science, the nih brain initiative encourages inclusivity in research. examples of structures that promote diverse perspectives include but are not limited to:the nih also encourages businesses to participate in the brain initiative. it is possible for companies to submit applications directly to brain initiative program announcements or to collaborate with academic researchers in joint submissions. small businesses should consider applying to one of the brain initiative small business foas.the brain initiative requires a high level of coordination and sharing between investigators. it is expected that brain initiative awardees will cooperate and coordinate their activities after awards are made by participating in program director/principal investigator (pd/pi) meetings and in other activities such as the annual pi meeting. the data sharing expectations for brain initiative awards can be found at not-mh-19-010.this foa requires a plan for enhancing diverse perspectives (pedp) as part of the application (see further below). applicants are strongly encouraged to read the foa instructions carefully and view the available pedp guidance material.one of the defined themes in the brain 2025 report is: “considers ethical implications of neuroscience research.” although ethical issues that are common to other areas of biomedical science also impact brain research, there are special ethical considerations unique to brain research. considering that the brain gives rise to consciousness, our innermost thoughts, and our most basic human needs, it comes as no surprise that mechanistic studies of the brain have revealed novel social and ethical questions. with respect to research supported by the brain initiative, there are important ethical issues in areas such as brain imaging and modulation, data privacy, informed consent, and many other areas germane to the brain initiative that warrant focused attention. it is clear that these critical issues must be considered thoughtfully and with an empirical research framework. specifically, brain 2025 describes the importance of “support for data-driven research to inform ethical issues arising from brain initiative research, ideally with integrated activities between ethicists and neuroscientists.” in addition, feedback solicited through a brain neuroethics request for information underscores that the broader public and scientists alike endorse that scientific advances and technology development are well-served by thoughtful consideration of potential ethical issues.this foa seeks to provide opportunities to directly consider the integration of ethical issues with brain-supported scientific advances. specifically, this foa seeks to support efforts addressing core ethical issues associated with research focused on the human brain and resulting from emerging technologies and advancements in research and development supported by the brain initiative. the goal is that efforts supported under this initiative will be both complementary and integrative with the transformative, breakthrough neuroscience discoveries supported through the brain initiative.the advisory council to the director working group on brain 2.0 neuroethics subgroup identified several broad areas for the brain initiative to consider as suggested next steps:in addition to these broad areas, several specific neuroethics topics remain central to the cutting-edge research supported through the brain initiative. these topics include, but are not limited to:research participant engagement, special populations, and social implicationsdata collection/storage/sharing and model systemsplan for enhancing diverse perspectivesthis foa requires a plan for enhancing diverse perspectives (pedp) in the application (see further below), and applicants are strongly encouraged to attend the technical assistance teleconference to ask for information on preparing a pedp.applications must include a plan for enhancing diverse perspectives (pedp) submitted as other project information as an attachment (see section iv; further below). the pedp will be assessed as part of the scientific and technical peer review evaluation, as well as at the programmatic level with respect to funding decisions.protection of human subjects: applications with data collection plans that involve multiple respondent groups (e.g., clients/patients, therapists/providers, supervisors, administrators) should address provisions for human subject protections and
