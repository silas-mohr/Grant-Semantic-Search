institute of child health and human development ( nichd )all applications to this funding opportunity announcement should fall within the mission of the institutes/centers. the following nih offices may co-fund applications assigned to those institutes/centers.office of behavioral and social sciences research (obssr)the purpose of this notice of special interest (nosi) is to encourage grant applications to support the evaluation of the utility and validity of digital health and artificial intelligence (ai) tools and technologies in epidemiological, clinical, and intervention research. the intent is to support the addition of new measurement modalities to evaluate existing and recently developed but not yet validated digital health and ai tools such as sensor technologies, smartphone applications, software as a medical device (samd), and ai algorithms.backgrounddigital health and ai technologies have grown exponentially in the past two decades. digital health technologies include mobile devices, health information technology, wearable devices, sensors, telehealth and telemedicine, and internet of things (iot). ai tools include computational technology integrated within devices or platforms as well as stand-alone ai technologies such as samd, risk assessment and prognosis algorithms, and software for informing health care used in the cure, mitigation, treatment, recovery, or prevention of health conditions without being part of a hardware medical device.the range of health research and practice affected by the technological revolution is quite broad, including use in disease surveillance and public health research as well as for medical screening and diagnostic purposes where they can provide tools that can reach diverse users including individuals living in rural and underserved areas and low- and middle-income countries. however, many of these recently released tools are unregulated and their validity, reliability, and/or efficaciousness for research, practice, and clinical care have not been examined. adoption of these technologies requires more rigorous evaluation across research and clinical settings, diverse populations, and health contexts. through this nosi, nih strives to capitalize on current research projects that collect outcomes to validate digital health and ai tools.research objectivesresearch supported by this nosi is expected to provide support for validation of recently developed digital health and ai technologies. digital health and ai technologies are defined broadly to include any health technology leveraging mobile health, health information technology, wearable devices, sensors, telehealth and telemedicine, internet of things (iot), software as a medical device (samd) and/or related ai algorithms and tools to monitor and manage health across the life course. as noted previously, the purpose of this nosi is not to support development of new technologies.applicants should clearly justify the importance and implications of validating digital health and ai tools and technologies. studies should apply rigorous research methods to evaluate the effectiveness of any proposed digital health and ai applications including the use of gold-standard comparators. projects that validate digital health or ai tools for use in larger or more specific populations (e.g., low income, minority group) and research projects that evaluate the reliability of the tool and its sensitivity are encouraged.studies proposing secondary analysis should address the sufficiency of existing datasets to validate technologies and deepen the evidence base of digital health and ai applications while also addressing potential bias, including plans for risk mitigation that ensure safety, privacy, and effectiveness among diverse individuals and populations.fda regulated devices, activities included under this notice should follow fda guidance and support appropriate activities leading to a future marketing submission to the fda.investigators must carefully review the specific research interests of nih institutes and centers that are participating in this nosi.ic specific application and submission informationapplicants must select the ic and associated foa to use for submission of an application in response to the nosi. the selection must align with the ic
