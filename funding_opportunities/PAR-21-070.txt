except where instructed to do otherwise (in this foa or in a notice from nih guide for grants and contracts).conformance to all requirements (both in the application guide and the foa) is required and strictly enforced. applicants must read and follow all application instructions in the application guide as well as any program-specific instructions noted in section iv. when the program-specific instructions deviate from those in the application guide, follow the program-specific instructions.applications that do not comply with these instructions may be delayed or not accepted for review.there are several options available to submit your application through grants.gov to nih and department of health and human services partners. you must use one of these submission options to access the application forms for this opportunity.backgroundmore than 38 million individuals worldwide are currently living with hiv; new infections occur at a rate of 1.7 million per year worldwide, and 39,000 per year in the u.s. although currently there is no cure for hiv, current antiretroviral treatment (art) regimens are very potent and reduce plasma virus to undetectable levels in most patients, leading to reduced morbidity, mortality, and transmission. multiple clinical studies have provided strong evidence that undetectable = untransmittable (u=u) — people who maintain an undetectable viral load cannot sexually transmit the virus to others. however, at least 20% of hiv-positive individuals are unaware of their hiv status, and nearly 40% are not on suppressive treatment. for individuals who do achieve undetectable hiv levels in blood, viral rebound can occur following inconsistent adherence to the treatment regimen, intentional treatment interruption, or emergence of drug resistance mutations. the timing of rebound can be unpredictable, usually with a rapid increase in viral load. regular self-monitoring for hiv would help individuals identify viral rebound quickly and seek intervention to prevent clinical progression and transmission.since 2016, the world health organization has recommended hiv self-testing as an additional approach to increase hiv testing services. currently available rapid hiv self-tests depend on detection of host antibody responses, which are most reliably detectable several weeks after infection. these tests could not be used to detect the initial peak viremia in early infection, before antibody production, nor viral rebound following treatment interruption or emergence of drug resistance, where antibodies would already be present prior to rebound. direct detection of hiv, rather than antibody, would be necessary in these cases. sensitive and accurate tests to directly measure hiv involve either expensive, sophisticated equipment in a lab or hospital setting, or point of care devices that require a trained individual to administer the test and read the result. development of simple, inexpensive, rapid self-testing assays to directly detect hiv would enable individuals to more easily monitor their hiv or viral suppression status. rapidly evolving molecular diagnostics and manufacturing technologies could be useful in developing innovative approaches to fulfilling this need.purposethe purpose of this funding opportunity announcement (foa) is to stimulate innovative, collaborative, interdisciplinary research and early-stage diagnostic technology development focused on rapid, simple, sensitive, and cost-effective assays appropriate for hiv self-testing during the earliest phases of acute infection and/or during viral rebound. the proposed research should establish feasibility for direct detection of hiv (rna, dna, protein, or biomarkers that reliably correlate with hiv positivity or rebound) in a qualitative or semi-quantitative diagnostic self-test assay. the assays should be designed with a user-centered approach and should be as easy to perform as a home pregnancy test or an in-home glucose monitoring device.research objectives and scopethis foa will support high-risk, bi-phasic, milestone-driven research and early-stage development of innovative technologies designed to enable rapid self-testing assays to meet one or both of the following research objectives:strategies may include either the initial development of a novel technology or adaptation of an existing technology to detect hiv from finger stick blood or other biospecimen. proposed studies are expected to be at the discovery and feasibility stage, designed to show potential efficacy in the detection of hiv and feasibility as a self-test platform.proposed studies should emphasize innovation and exploratory research with a focus on qualitative or semi-quantitative hiv detection and assay development. innovative technologies such as microfluidics for electricity-free rna/dna amplification, synthetic biology approaches, paper- or plastic-based analytical platforms, and smartphone-enabled diagnostics are highly encouraged. additional studies to address assay feasibility may include but are not limited to:development of such technology is expected to require collaboration among experts in the fields of virology and biotechnology (e.g., microfluidics, bioengineering, synthetic biology, nanotechnology, and/or manufacturing), as well as clinical, social and behavioral science. applicants must demonstrate that they are capable of developing the proposed technologies and assay, have access to appropriate virus and biospecimen resources, and have the means to obtain meaningful end-user input on assay performance and usability during early-stage assay development.upon completion, successful projects will have demonstrated proof-of-concept for prototype assay technology capable of detecting hiv in human biospecimen samples without the use of expensive equipment or trained individuals. assays ready for more advanced product development and commercialization would be potentially appropriate for the niaid sbir/sttr program (https://www.niaid.nih.gov/research/grants-small-business).specific performance criteria are not required, but assay design, proposed studies, and milestones for feasibility should consider how to achieve desirable features for an ideal diagnostic:nida is interested in the following research areas relevant to people who inject and/or use drugs (pwid/pwud) who are likely to experience gaps in hiv testing and care:nichd is interested in the following research areas:applications not responsive to this foaapplications including any of the following will be considered non-responsive and withdrawn prior to review:phased innovation awardsdue to the high-risk, high-impact nature of the research, this funding opportunity will use the r61/r33 phased innovation grant award mechanism. support will be provided for up to three years (r61 phase) for hypothesis- and milestone-driven basic technology research, assay development, and end-user input. up to two years of support may follow (r33 phase) for additional activities as appropriate, such as expanded assay development, optimization, proof of concept validation with human samples, and usability testing. proposed milestones will be reviewed and negotiated prior to award.before the end of the r61 phase, awardees will submit the r33 transition package, which includes a detailed progress report describing advancement toward the initial milestones and a description of how the completed work justifies continuation with the originally proposed r33 studies. these materials will be evaluated by nih program staff; grants selected for continued funding will be transitioned to an r33 award without the need to submit a new application. transition to the r33 phase is neither automatic nor guaranteed; r33 funding decisions will be based on the original r61/r33 peer review recommendations, successful completion of transition milestones, program priorities, and availability of funds. it is expected that approximately one-half of the projects supported during the r61 phase will continue into the r33 phase.see section viii. other information for award authorities and regulations.grant: a support mechanism providing money, property, or both to an eligible entity to carry out an approved project or
