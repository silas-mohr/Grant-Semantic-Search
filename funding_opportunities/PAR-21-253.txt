and metabolic diseases, and cancer. the microbiota metabolizes dietary components, antibiotics and other xenobiotics to a variety of bioactive metabolites that may influence host metabolic pathways and pathophysiology. in order to establish causal associations between the gut microbiota and host metabolism and to guide targeted precision nutrition and precision medicine approaches, it is crucial to understand the entire spectrum of possible microbial metabolites and their biological relevance to host physiology. several biologically relevant metabolites have been recently identified and catalogued (doi:10.1126/science.1254766; doi:10.1016/j.tips.2019.04.006). however, a vast majority of microbial metabolites remain unknown, impeding the progress in the advancement of microbiome research and for the characterization of host microbiome interactions.recent scientific advances in the microbiome field have arisen from combining metabolomics technologies with metagenomics, meta-transcriptomics, biosynthetic candidate bacterial gene clustering approaches to identify and characterize microbially derived metabolites. other advances in model systems to interrogate the function of identified metabolites including artificial gut simulators, organoids, and humanized mouse models along with in silico and synthetic biology approaches further enable characterization of microbial metabolites. the current foa invites applications that employ combinations of recent and novel innovations and resources for identifying, characterizing and determining the function of microbial metabolites, including circulating microbial metabolites, beyond what is already known. the applicants may include well-characterized microbial metabolites (e.g., short chain fatty acids, bile salts, amino acid metabolites, vitamins and antimicrobials), but the emphasis should be on the identification and characterization of novel and less well understood metabolites. applicants are encouraged to build on observations of known bioactive microbial metabolites, which will serve as the basis for the further identification and characterization in any proposed new studies. the current foa is focused on hypothesis-generation and does not support clinical trials, or studies that functionally characterize only previously identified candidate metabolites.research objectives that could be supported include but are not limited to:data sharing and creation of knowledgebase: one of the main objectives of the foa is to provide data that will be needed to develop a knowledgebase that is readily accessible by the research community. a knowledgebase management center (kmc) supported by a cooperative agreeement mechanism and u24 activity code, via rfa-dk-21-014: identification and characterization of bioactive microbial metabolites for advancing research on microbe-diet-host interactions knowledgebase management center (u24 clinical trial not allowed) will coordinate the activities of these sites for developing common data elements and formats for the creation of the knowledgebase. the resultant database will serve as a resource for the research community to stimulate additional research studies. in addition, the kmc will also support minimal tool development for enabling and facilitating data analysis of data contained within the knowledgebase and for improving the operations of the database.successful grantees will participate in activities organized by the kmc such as conference calls and other meetings, for the purposes of enhancing creation of the knowledgebase, developing necessary data pipelines, curation and harmonization strategies. the grantees will assist and advise the kmc in determining the analytical tools needed for analyzing the data and for enhancing the utility of the knowledgebase. in addition, grantees will also agree to deposit the data generated by their sites in the kmc, for the purposes of sharing the data widely with the research community. they will also agree to share the data among the grantees funded under this foa for the purposes of knowledge exchange. grantees will also agree to attend one annual in-person meeting organized by the kmc.applicants are strongly encouraged to pay close attention to specific ic interests for research examples provided below:niddk is interested in human studies that address the microbiome and its metabolites in response to a variety of dietary interventions; in digestive and metabolic diseases including diabetes and obesity.niddk is also interested in studies that explore the microbiome and its metabolites in gestational diabetes (and risk of gestation diabetes) that impact the health of pregnant mothers.nichd is interested in human studies that address the microbiome and its metabolites in infants who are born preterm or at low birthweights; in child growth and development; in relation to diet and/or nutritional status of children, pregnant individuals or lactating individuals. additionally, nichd is interested in the microbiome and its metabolites in gestational diabetes (and risk of gestation diabetes) on pregnancy outcomes and fetal outcomes.nidcr will consider applications for this foa within the above listed scope only if they pertain to the microbiota of the human oral cavity (specifically those microbial communities composed of oral health related archaea, bacteria, fungi and viruses). specific interest areas include the role of metabolites produced by the oral microbiota in: maintenance of a healthy oral environment; dysbiosis and disease of the oral cavity; host interactions and modulation of host metabolism; commensal and/or pathogenic bacterial interspecies interactions; and interactions affecting the interface between tooth and restorative materials.nci is primarily interested in understanding the relationship between the gut/oral microbiome and cancer development. several gut microbial-derived metabolites have been identified for their contribution to cancer prevention, risk, development and progression. microbial metabolites may also influence cancer treatment response and symptom management. the pro-tumorigenic effects of enterotoxigenic bacteroides fragilis, colibactin-producing escherichia coli and fusobacteria are thought to occur through the production of toxins and oncometabolites that affect oncogenic signaling pathways. in contrast, the biological effects of microbial metabolites generated from dietary components such as tryptophan metabolites and short-chain fatty acids may be cancer preventive. for example, short chain fatty acids have been observed to regulate inflammatory responses, intestinal barrier function, oxidative stress and carcinogenesis in preclinical models. nci is interested in research aimed at identifying and characterizing additional/novel diet-microbial derived metabolites that influence cancer processes throughout the cancer spectrum. the rationale for selecting clinical studies and biological samples for discovery of novel metabolites should be grounded in sound epidemiologic and biologic evidence. nci is also interested in supporting applications that explore the biological function and molecular mechanisms of these novel microbial metabolites.examples of responsive research applications include, but are not limited to:niehs will consider applications for this foa within the above listed scope if they include consideration of microbial metabolites that are derived from exposure to environmental chemicals, or those that interact with environmental chemicals inside the host. environmental factors of interest are: chemicals that people are exposed to via air, water, or food, including air pollutants, pesticides, metals, industrial chemicals, nanomaterials, or environmental tobacco smoke.niaid conducts and supports basic and applied research to better understand, treat, and ultimately prevent infectious, immunologic, and allergic diseases. the myriad microbial metabolites produced by the microbiota influence resistance to infectious and immune-mediated diseases, host response to infection, immune system development, and response to radiation injuries. identification of these metabolites and the bacteria that produce them may provide the mechanistic insight needed to translate this knowledge into effective therapeutics and novel prophylactics for infectious, immunologic, or allergic diseases, or radiation injuries. niaid therefore encourages collaboration between scientists studying the human microbiome and infectious disease experts and/or immunologists and/or radiation biologists on the identification and characterization of bioactive, microbial-derived metabolites for their translational potential to improve human health. examples of responsive research include, but are not limited to:applications not responsive to this foaapplications that do not address one of the diseases described by the above ics will not be considered responsive to this foa. applications proposing only identification or characterization of microbial metabolites will also be considered non-responsive. applications that are unwilling to to work with the knowledgebase management center or deposit the data in the kmc will be considered non-responsive. non-responsive applications for this foa will be withdrawn without review.see section viii. other information for award authorities and regulations.grant: a support mechanism providing money, property, or both to an eligible entity

other human subject research to facilitate broader and more effective use of data and advance research across studies. cdes are data elements that have been identified and defined for use in multiple data sets across different studies. use of cdes can facilitate data sharing and standardization to improve data quality and enable data integration from multiple studies and sources, including electronic health records. nih ics have identified cdes for many clinical domains (e.g., neurological disease), types of studies (e.g. genome-wide association studies (gwas)), types of outcomes (e.g., patient-reported outcomes), and patient registries (e.g., the global rare diseases patient registry and data repository). nih has established a “common data element (cde) resource portal" (https://cde.nlm.nih.gov/home/) to assist investigators in identifying nih-supported cdes when developing protocols, case report forms, and other instruments for data collection. the portal provides guidance about and access to nih-supported cde initiatives and other tools and resources for the appropriate use of cdes and data standards in nih-funded research. investigators are encouraged to consult the portal and describe in their applications any use they will make of nih-supported cdes in their projects.applicants are required to follow the instructions for post-submission materials, as described in the policy. any instructions provided here are in addition to the instructions in the policy.note: effective for due dates on or after january 25, 2023, the data sharing plan and
