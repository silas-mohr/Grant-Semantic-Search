to support collaborative research projects designed to address adverse sequelae of cancer therapies that persist and become chronic comorbidities or develop as delayed posttreatment effects. this foa supports basic, translational, and/or clinical research projects that seek to identify the mechanisms of therapy-induced adverse sequelae, clinically characterize the adverse sequelae, or translate the mechanistic understanding into therapeutic approaches to prevent or minimize the development of long-term sequelae. research projects should focus on 1) mechanistic studies with translational endpoints; and/or 2) longitudinal clinical phenotyping to identify and validate clinical endpoints (biomarkers, imaging, patient-reported outcomes, or combined elements) for future use in clinical trials that will evaluate the efficacy of interventions designed to prevent or reduce specific adverse sequelae.30 days prior to the application due dateall applications are due by 5:00 pm local time of applicant organization. all types of non-aids applications allowed for this funding opportunity announcement are due on the listed date(s).applicants are encouraged to apply early to allow adequate time to make any corrections to errors found in the application during the submission process by the due date.not applicableit is critical that applicants follow the instructions in the research (r) instructions in the sf424 (r&r) application guide, except where instructed to do otherwise (in this foa or in a notice from nih guide for grants and contracts).conformance to all requirements (both in

noted in section iv. when the program-specific instructions deviate from those in the application guide, follow the program-specific instructions.applications that do not comply with these instructions may be delayed or not accepted for review.there are several options available to submit your application through grants.gov to nih and department of health and human services partners. you must use one of these submission options to access the application forms for this opportunity.purposethe purpose of this funding opportunity announcement (foa) is to support collaborative research projects designed to address adverse sequelae of cancer therapies that persist and become chronic comorbidities or develop as delayed posttreatment effects. this foa supports basic, translational, and/or clinical research projects that seek to identify the mechanisms of therapy-induced adverse sequelae, clinically characterize the adverse sequelae, and/or translate the mechanistic understanding into therapeutic approaches to prevent or minimize the development of long-term sequelae.this foa will utilize the research project grant (r01) mechanism and is suitable for projects where supportive preliminary data are available.backgroundmany advances have been made in the treatment of cancer with an increasing number of treatment options available to cancer patients including surgery, radiation, and/or systemic therapy (chemotherapy, immunotherapy, targeted or hormonal therapies) from which severe adverse sequelae may result. the number of cancer survivors continues to grow, with more than 15 million alive today, of which 56% have been diagnosed within the past ten years and 47% are aged 70 or older. often, the extent of the toxicity burden is unknown until the therapy is administered to a large population of 'real-world' patients with comorbidities that were not included in the definitive clinical trials. cancer registries do not typically collect information on treatment-related adverse effects and identifying chronic or late-onset adverse effects can be challenging.commonly, systemic cancer treatment can result in acute, cumulative, progressive, and/or chronic toxicities. some acute drug-related adverse events (e.g. acute nausea and vomiting, infections) can be mitigated by reducing treatment exposures and/or implementing evidence-based treatments and will resolve once therapy has been completed. similarly, acute inflammatory responses resulting from immunotherapy can be managed by discontinuing therapy or treating with immunosuppressive corticosteroids. other adverse effects persist after completion of therapy or develop as late effects of therapy. for radiation therapy, adverse effects can develop acutely, resulting in dosing modifications, or occur as an intermediate or late effect. some of the chronic or late adverse effects may reduce the overall benefit from therapy, by reducing the patient's quality of life following therapy and/or introducing additional morbidities that impair overall survival. these adverse sequelae include, but are not limited to, therapy-induced peripheral neuropathy, neurocognitive impairments, cardiovascular toxicity, pulmonary fibrosis, arthralgias, fatigue, nephrotoxicity, ototoxicity, and various immune system-related adverse events. while a variety of acute inflammatory adverse reactions have been reported with anti-checkpoint immunotherapy, the long-term consequences of checkpoint blockade or cellular immunotherapy are not known.with the introduction of new treatment approaches adverse events not seen with older therapies are emerging. pre-treatment baseline assessments are often inadequate, impairing the ability to understand individual variability and sub-clinical risk factors. to date, little is known about the differential rates and severity of these newer adverse effects, particularly for immunotherapy agents and combination therapies involving immunotherapies. further, it is unknown how age, race/ethnicity and co-morbid conditions will affect the development, progression, or severity of these adverse events. in some cases, it is not a single adverse event, but a cluster of events that may herald the development of significant sequelae.given the high prevalence and significant impact of cancer treatment-related adverse effects, there is a need to understand both the mechanisms for their acute development and the clinical trajectory of the events that become chronic sequelae, including the variability in severity and duration of specific chronic or late effects.for most of the cancer treatment-related adverse effects, no approved mitigating therapies or evidence-based management strategies are in place. efforts to develop nontoxic interventions to relieve treatment-related toxicities are hampered by a lack of mechanistic insight into these adverse events, difficulties in objectively measuring treatment-related toxic effects, insufficient characterization of the clinical phenotype, and insufficient studies validating pre-clinical biomarkers in the clinical setting.specific areas of research interestapplications submitted to this foa should focus on cancer therapy-induced adverse sequelae that persist and become chronic comorbidities or develop as delayed posttreatment effects. these adverse sequelae include, but are not limited to, therapy-induced peripheral neuropathy, neurocognitive impairments, cardiovascular toxicity, pulmonary fibrosis, arthralgias, fatigue, nephrotoxicity, ototoxicity, and various immune system-related adverse events.the scope of research projects includes: 1) mechanistic studies with translational endpoints and/or 2) longitudinal clinical phenotyping to identify and validate future clinical endpoints for use in clinical trials that will evaluate the efficacy of interventions designed to prevent or reduce specific adverse sequelae.projects with multidisciplinary collaboration among researchers and that couple the mechanistic knowledge with clinical phenotype will be prioritized.research projects may be conducted in basic science and/or clinical settings. applications should identify the specific adverse sequelae, which may include a cluster of adverse events that occur sequentially or in tandem with rationale for the cluster. the adverse sequelae may be chronic, progressive, or a later adverse effect for which current management strategies are limited or ineffective.research topics of interest include, but are not limited to:clinical

addition, for applications involving clinical trials: a proposed clinical trial application may include study design, methods, and intervention that are not by themselves innovative but address important questions or unmet needs. additionally, the results of the clinical trial may indicate that further clinical development of the intervention is unwarranted or lead to new avenues of
