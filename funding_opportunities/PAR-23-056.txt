instructions now availablesee section iii. 3. additional information on eligibility.the purpose of this funding opportunity announcement (foa) is to enhance mechanistic and epidemiologic investigations addressing the roles of co-infection and cancer to shed light on presently unestablished pathways in carcinogenesis that may inform prevention and treatment strategies for infection-related cancers. co-infection is defined as the occurrence of infections by two or more infectious (pathogenic or non-pathogenic) agents – either concurrently or sequentially – and includes both acute and chronic infections by viruses, bacteria, parasites, and/or other microorganisms. preference will be given to investigations of co-infections with known oncogenic agents (excluding human immunodeficiency virus [hiv]) and of co-infections that engender novel opportunities for prevention and treatment.30 days prior to the application due dateall applications are due by 5:00 pm local time of applicant organization.applicants are encouraged to apply early to allow adequate time to make any corrections to errors found in the application during the submission process by the due date.not applicableit is critical that applicants follow the instructions in the research (r) instructions in the sf424 (r&r) application guide, except where instructed to do otherwise (in this foa or in a notice from nih guide for grants and contracts).conformance to all requirements (both in the application guide and the foa) is required and strictly enforced. applicants must read and follow all application instructions in the application guide as well as any program-specific instructions noted in section iv. when the program-specific instructions deviate from those in the application guide, follow the program-specific instructions.applications that do not comply with these instructions may be delayed or not accepted for review.there are several options available to submit your application through grants.gov to nih and department of health and human services partners. you must use one of these submission options to access the application forms for this opportunity.purposethe purpose of this funding opportunity announcement (foa) is to enhance mechanistic and epidemiologic investigations addressing the roles of co-infection and cancer to shed light on presently unestablished pathways in carcinogenesis that may inform prevention and treatment strategies for infection-related cancers. co-infection is defined as the occurrence of infections by two or more infectious (pathogenic or non-pathogenic) agents – either concurrently or sequentially – and includes both acute and chronic infections by viruses, bacteria, parasites, and/or other microorganisms. investigations of cancer-related to co-infections with known oncogenic agents and of co-infections that engender novel opportunities for prevention and treatment are appropriate. in addition to co-infection with pathogenic agents, investigations focus on the interplay with non-pathogenic (e.g., microbiome) would be deemed responsive while investigations solely focus on co-infection with human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) would not be deemed responsive to this foa.applications submitted to this foa should be exploratory and novel. these studies should break new ground or extend previous discoveries toward new directions or applications. whereas this foa is for pilot/exploratory projects, a companion foa of identical scientific scope, par-23-055, is meant for well-developed projects supported by preliminary data.background and rationalecarcinogenic infections are important causes of cancer and contribute significantly to the global cancer burden. approximately 13% of all new cancer cases worldwide are attributable to infectious agents, with substantial variation between geographical regions that parallels the prevalence of the infections. likewise, in the united states (u.s.), the burden of infection-related cancers varies by racial/ethnic groups and geographical regions. the international agency for research on cancer (iarc) has classified 10 infectious agents as group 1 carcinogens. these iarc group 1 agents (e.g., helicobacter pylori [h.pylori], epstein barr virus [ebv], hepatitis b virus [hepatitis b], hepatitis c virus [hepatitis c], and human papillomavirus [hpv) have been linked to a constellation of cancers. other agents such as herpes simplex virus, chlamydia trachomatis, enterotoxigenic bacteroides fragilis, escherichia coli, fusobacteria have or may potentiate carcinogenic properties and are hypothesized to contribute to cancer, either independently or as cofactors.helicobacter pylori, hpv, and ebv are ubiquitous in the population, but despite their high prevalence (e.g., 50% for h.pylori; >40% for hpv; >95% for ebv; ), most infected individuals do not develop the associated cancer, suggesting that additional cofactors are required. it has been hypothesized, if a known infectious agent was to play any role in oncogenesis, other factors must be crucial to this process. emerging evidence from experimental and observational studies demonstrates that a substantial proportion of individual with cancers are co-infected with multiple pathogens, suggesting an important role of co-infection in cancer etiology and progression. although there is evidence suggesting that multiple infections may play a significant role in cancer initiation, development, and progression, a direct role in causation is currently unclear. the mechanisms by which co-infections may contribute to the etiology, pathogenesis, and the epidemiology of specific co-infections in cancer are also poorly defined and understudied. it is unclear if pathogenic and non-pathogenic co-infection interact to alter virulence, tissue homeostasis, or immune functions to predispose hosts to tumor formation.the probability of individuals being infected with two or more distinct oncogenic or onco-potentiating agents is high due to their prevalence in the population. co-infections are common in developing countries and likely as common in developed countries. it is also plausible that extreme temperatures due to climate change and ecological perturbations will have implications on the spread of vector-borne and water-borne infections, the prevalence of co-infections, and consequently the burden of the associated malignancies. therefore, co-infection by multiple agents and its role in cancer is a research area that warrants further investigation.scope of the foaapplicants should propose mechanistic and/or epidemiologic investigations addressing the roles of co-infection and cancer. applicants may also propose developing new models needed to investigate molecular mechanisms of co-infection in cancer. applicants are encouraged to propose studies to investigate differences in mechanisms contributing to co-infection and its relation to cancer risk, progression, and survival among racially/ethnically diverse populations, those from urban and rural areas who are poor, and medically underserved and populations who may have a disproportionate burden of infection-related cancers. study aims may extend to international settings, as the proportion of infection-associated cancers is higher in low- and middle-income countries. u.s.-based applicants are encouraged to engage in equitable international partnerships when appropriate and needed to expand and relate research findings worldwide level. applicants are strongly encouraged to propose studies that investigate mechanisms associated with co-infection and its relation to cancer risk, progression, or survival among diverse populations (extending beyond race and ethnicity). when appropriate, applicants are strongly encouraged to propose novel approaches, including the use of non-invasive imaging to identify and monitor infection and host-associated response. a clinical trial is not allowed for the r21 mechanism, though mechanistic translational studies and/or studies using previously collected human samples are encouraged.broad examination of co-infection in cancer susceptibility and progression may answer questions such as:special areas of research focusareas of research interest include, but are not limited to, the following research objectives:co-infection etiology and epidemiology studies:basic mechanistic studies:biomarkers, early detection, and prevention:health disparities:non-responsive applicationsapplications that propose

that have the potential for significant impact on biomedical or biobehavioral research. an r21 grant application need not have extensive background material or preliminary information. accordingly, reviewers will emphasize the conceptual framework, the level of innovation, and the potential to significantly advance our knowledge or understanding. appropriate justification for the proposed work can be provided through literature citations, data from other sources, or, when available, from investigator-generated data. preliminary data are not required for r21 applications; however, they may be included if available.reviewers will provide an overall impact score to reflect their assessment of the likelihood for the project to exert a sustained, powerful influence on the research field(s) involved, in consideration of the following review criteria and additional review criteria (as applicable for the project proposed).reviewers will consider each of the review criteria below in the determination of scientific merit and give a separate score for each. an application does not need to be strong in all categories to be judged likely to have major scientific impact. for example, a project that by its nature is not innovative may be essential to advance a field.does the project address an important problem or a critical barrier to progress in the field? is the prior research that serves as the key support for the proposed project rigorous? if the aims of the project are achieved, how will scientific knowledge, technical capability, and/or clinical practice be improved? how will successful completion of the aims change the concepts, methods, technologies, treatments, services, or preventative interventions that drive this field?specific to this foa:are the pd(s)/pi(s), collaborators, and other researchers well suited to the project? if early stage investigators or those in the early stages of independent careers, do they have appropriate experience and training? if established, have they demonstrated an ongoing record of accomplishments that have advanced their field(s)? if the project is collaborative or multi-pd/pi, do the investigators have complementary and integrated expertise; are their leadership approach, governance, and organizational structure appropriate for the project?specific to this foa:does the application challenge and seek to shift current research or clinical practice paradigms by utilizing novel theoretical concepts, approaches or methodologies, instrumentation, or interventions? are the concepts, approaches or methodologies, instrumentation, or interventions novel to one field of research or novel in a broad sense? is a refinement, improvement, or new application of theoretical concepts, approaches or methodologies, instrumentation, or interventions proposed?specific to this foa:are the overall strategy, methodology, and analyses well-reasoned and appropriate to accomplish the specific aims of the project? have the investigators included plans to address weaknesses in the rigor of prior research that serves as the key support for the proposed project? have the investigators presented strategies to ensure a robust and unbiased approach, as appropriate for the work proposed? are potential problems, alternative strategies, and benchmarks for success presented? if the project is in the early stages of development, will the strategy establish feasibility and will particularly risky aspects be managed? have the investigators presented adequate plans to address relevant biological variables, such as sex, for studies in vertebrate animals or human subjects?if the project involves human subjects and/or nih-defined clinical research, are the plans to address 1) the protection of human subjects from research risks, and 2) inclusion (or exclusion) of individuals on the basis of sex/gender, race, and ethnicity, as well as the inclusion or exclusion of individuals of all ages (including children and older adults), justified in terms of the scientific goals and research strategy proposed?specific to this foa:will the scientific environment in which the work will be done contribute to the probability of success? are the institutional support, equipment, and other physical resources available to the investigators adequate for the project proposed? will the project benefit from unique features of the scientific environment, subject populations, or collaborative arrangements?specific to this foa:as applicable for the project proposed, reviewers will evaluate the following additional items while determining scientific and technical merit, and in providing an overall impact score, but will not give separate scores for these items.for research that involves human subjects but does not involve one of the categories of research that are exempt under 45 cfr part 46, the committee will evaluate the justification for involvement of human subjects and the proposed protections from research risk relating to their participation according to the following five review criteria: 1) risk to subjects, 2) adequacy of protection against risks, 3) potential benefits to the subjects and others, 4) importance of the knowledge to be gained, and 5) data and safety monitoring for clinical trials.for research that involves human subjects and meets the criteria for one or more of the categories of research that are exempt under 45 cfr part 46, the committee will evaluate: 1) the justification for the exemption, 2) human subjects involvement and characteristics, and 3) sources of materials. for additional information on review of the human subjects section, please refer to the guidelines for the review of human subjects.when the proposed project involves human subjects and/or nih-defined clinical research, the committee will evaluate the proposed plans for the inclusion (or exclusion) of individuals on the basis of sex/gender, race, and ethnicity, as well as the inclusion (or exclusion) of individuals of all ages (including children and older adults) to determine if it is justified in terms of the scientific goals and research strategy proposed. for additional information on review of the inclusion section, please refer to the guidelines for the review of inclusion in clinical research.the committee will evaluate the involvement of live vertebrate animals as part of the scientific assessment according to the following criteria: (1) description of proposed procedures involving animals, including species, strains, ages, sex, and total number to be used; (2) justifications for the use of animals versus alternative models and for the appropriateness of the species proposed; (3) interventions to minimize discomfort, distress, pain and injury; and (4) justification for euthanasia method if not consistent with the avma guidelines for the euthanasia of animals. reviewers will assess the use of chimpanzees as they would any other application proposing the use of vertebrate animals. for additional information on review of the vertebrate animals section, please refer to the worksheet for review of the vertebrate animals section.reviewers will assess whether materials or procedures proposed are potentially hazardous to research personnel and/or the environment, and if needed, determine whether adequate protection is proposed.for resubmissions, the committee will evaluate the application as now presented, taking into consideration the responses to comments from the previous scientific review group and changes made to the project.not applicablenot applicableas applicable for the project proposed, reviewers will consider each of the following items, but will not give scores for these items, and should not consider them in providing an overall impact score.reviewers will assess whether the project presents special opportunities for furthering research programs through the use of unusual talent, resources, populations, or environmental conditions that exist in other countries and either are not readily available in the united states or augment existing u.s.
