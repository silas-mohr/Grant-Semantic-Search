been an overreliance on the prescription of opioids for chronic pain despite their poor ability to improve function and high addiction liability. this contributed to a significant and alarming epidemic of opioid addictions and overdose deaths. innovative scientific solutions to develop alternative pain treatments are critically needed.through targeted research efforts, the nih heal initiative aims to accelerate the discovery and successful translation of new pain therapeutics by supporting collaborative efforts to gain a better, more direct understanding of human pain-associated genes, cells, and tissues that underly specific human pain types, conditions and/or diseases. towards that end, this funding opportunity announcement (foa) is designed to support multidisciplinary research teams that will perform highly collaborative and coordinated research to use human tissue and cells to generate comprehensive datasets characterizing the functional genetic elements, epigenetic signatures, and molecular/cellular pathways that contribute to human pain signal transduction, transmission, and processing. these datasets will serve as the basis for a future integrated knowledgebase that will facilitate the discovery and validation of therapeutic targets for specific human pain conditions and/or diseases, including in conditions of chronic drug use, substance use disorders (suds), and other co-morbid and/or overlapping pain conditions.backgroundthis funding announcement is part of the nih’s helping to end addiction long-term (heal) initiative to speed scientific solutions to the national opioid public health crisis. the nih heal initiative bolsters research across nih to (1) improve treatment for opioid misuse and addiction and (2) enhance pain management. more information about the heal initiative is available at: https://heal.nih.gov/.the advent of single cell -omics and high throughput electrophysiologic technologies provide an immense opportunity to significantly expand currently available datasets concerning gene expression and cellular function of human pain processing cells and/or tissues. for example, several recent transcriptomic and single-cell functional studies utilizing primary neurons from human pain processing tissues; namely dorsal root ganglia (drg), spinal cord (sc), trigeminal ganglia (tg), and tibial nerves, have identified a number of potential genetic and cellular differences in human sensory neuron electrophysiologic signatures with translational implications. in addition, recent comparative transcriptomic studies of [whole] drgs obtained from human subjects with or without pain conditions suggest several common genes associated with a small subset of neuropathic and cancer pain conditions. while promising, these data only begin to uncover the breadth of knowledge to be gained in this space and highlight the need to expand datasets to include heterogeneities across specific pain type/conditions comparing variables such as chronic analgesic or other drug use and co-morbid and/or overlapping pain conditions. it also highlights the need for standardization of methods, as approaches for tissue collection, processing, and analysis often vary across individual laboratories, thus posing a tremendous challenge for harmonized data collection, analysis, and reporting that would enable cross-comparison and rigorous validation.to capitalize on recent technological advances in high throughput analyses of molecular, anatomic, and physiological measurements for single cell and tissue-level characterizations and address the increasing need to enhance data interoperability and harmonization among data producers, the nih heal initiative has created the program to reveal and evaluate cells-to-gene information that specify intricacies, origins and the nature of human pain (precision human pain). the precision human pain network will be composed of a group of centers supported via two companion foas: the subject of this foa is the u19 centers for discovery and functional evaluation of human pain-associated genes & cells. the companion foa rfa-ns-22-021 will support a u24 human pain-associated genes & cells data coordination and integration center that will curate, harmonize, and integrate core datasets generated by the u19 centers to generate digital resources.rapid progress in the discovery and understanding of the role of functional genetic elements, epigenetic signatures, and molecular/cellular pathways that underlie human pain processing, as well as integrated data analysis and development of digital assets will require collaborations across disciplines. to effectively achieve the goals of the precision human pain network and facilitate advances in pain research, the nih heal initiative encourages the formation of multidisciplinary research teams including neurobiologists, pain biologists, human pain scientists and/or physicians, and scientists from statistics, physics, mathematics, engineering, and computer and information sciences. nih and the nih heal initiative also strongly encourage input from patients and caregivers on the scientific and research goals of this u19 research program.in addition to scientific diversity, applicants should strive to incorporate diversity in their team development plan. research shows that diverse teams working together and capitalizing on innovative ideas and distinct perspectives outperform homogenous teams. scientists and trainees from diverse backgrounds and life experiences bring different perspectives, creativity, and individual enterprise to address complex scientific problems. there are many benefits that flow from a diverse nih-supported scientific workforce, including: fostering scientific innovation, enhancing global competitiveness, contributing to robust learning environments, improving the quality of the research, advancing the likelihood that underserved or health disparity populations participate in, and benefit from health research, and enhancing public trust. please refer to notice of nih's interest in diversity?not-od-20-031?for more details.the nih heal initiative will require a high level of coordination and sharing between investigators. it is expected that nih heal initiative awardees will cooperate and coordinate their activities after awards are made by participating in program director/principal investigator (pd/pi) meetings, including an annual heal investigators meeting, as well as other activities. in addition, it is expected that precision human pain projects will work together, operating as a cooperative network to achieve its overall goals. this will include regular meetings and other coordinated activities within the precision human pain network as well as the nih heal initiative, and the nih more broadly. in particular, network centers will work closely with the heal data ecosystem, which coordinates data sharing across the heal initiative.research objectivesthe nih heal initiative - precision human pain networkthe objectives of this foa are to support multidisciplinary groups of researchers to conduct collaborative, team-based science utilizing cutting-edge technologies and approaches and large-scale, high throughput tissue and single-cell analysis on primary human tissues involved in human pain processing, including but not limited to drg, sc, tg, sympathetic ganglia (sg), brainstem, brain, peripheral nerve bundles/fibers, and skin to:studies should focus on large-scale analysis of human genes, epigenetic elements, proteome, metabolome, and phenotyping of neuronal and non-neuronal cells at single-cell and tissue levels, as well as their functional crosstalk that leads to hyper/hypo-activation of sensory neurons under individual pain types or pain conditions and/or diseases, including pain conditions in the context of chronic drug use, suds or co-morbid and/or overlapping pain conditions. ex vivo tissue analyses (including, but not limited to drg, tg, brainstem, brain and sc slices) are highly encouraged, as they could provide critical first-hand information on pain signal processing pathways and circuits in humans. this foa will also support studies on functional and pharmacological consequences of causal and genetic manipulations in primary human cell cultures and ex vivo human tissue slice preparations. in addition, this foa will support parallel human tissue proteomic, metabolomic and histological analysis to generate cellular and histological phenotypic information for specified pain conditions, in relation to the goals of individual research projects and/or centers.this foa embraces the existing efforts of the research community to enable a collaborative cross-center harmonization of human pain-associated tissue procurement and processing, optimization of experimental protocols, standardized assays, data collection, data harmonization, analysis, and reporting with high rigor, reproducibility and validation across centers. the u19 centers will be expected to extensively collaborate on harmonizing the procurement of human tissues through individual or consortia of local and regional transplant and trauma centers, human tissue resources for research purposes (e.g.: nih neurobiobank, national disease research interchange, and other similar resources), and contract research organizations providing such resources. applicants will also be expected to develop inclusion and exclusion criteria that will minimize the risk of abnormal or degraded tissue.in order to maximize the utility of the data, any human biological samples collected and studied or that are derived from existing biospecimens or sources are expected to have been obtained using a documented informed consent process that explicitly allows for future research use and broad data sharing (not-hg-20-011; see encode project for informed consent examples). sources with participant consent for unrestricted access is strongly encouraged. sources consented for sharing through a controlled-access environment, such as general research use (gru) or health, medical, and biomedical (hmb) without additional restrictions, will also be considered and should be well justified. applicants are also expected to consider ethical, legal and social issues (elsi) of tissue collection and to consider return of results to donors or their families.the u19 centers, along with the companion u24 data coordination and integration center, will collaboratively generate comprehensive, integrated datasets by curating and harmonizing u19 center-generated data and metadata elements, including but not limited to transcriptome, cellular function phenotypes, and disease/condition-specific transcriptome, proteome, metabolome and/or cellular functions, and tissue analysis.the expected outcomes of the nih heal initiative precision human pain network include:the comprehensive -omics and cellular function datasets generated from this initiative will significantly accelerate validation of therapeutic targets in human pain-relevant cells and tissue as well as facilitate the identification and development of potential markers that reflect target engagement, thus providing valuable assets for translational research and therapeutic development. these studies would be highly informative for multiple ongoing and future pre-clinical and translational programs in the nih heal initiative and the nih more broadly. as such, all precision human pain network centers will work closely with the purview of the nih heal initiative’s data ecosystem (https://heal.nih.gov/data/heal-data-ecosystem) to maximize sharing and dissemination of optimized protocols, data, and digital assets generated from this initiative to the broader pain research and therapeutics development communities.information relevant to specific institutes/centers/offices:national institute on aging (nia): nia strongly encourages investigators to discuss their research interests with nia program staff prior to submitting their grant application. nia encourages applications that propose a multidisciplinary team-based approach to collect data on molecular signatures, cell types, and cellular function phenotypes or signatures associated with human pain signal processing with relevance across a variety of pain conditions in the context of aging – both healthy and pathological. nia intends to administer applications under this foa that meet requirements central to nia’s mission of improving the health and well-being of older adults through research.national institute of dental and craniofacial research (nidcr): nidcr encourages applications that include the human genes, epigenetics, proteomics, metabolomics, and molecular/cellular phenotypes associated with craniofacial disorders and orofacial pain, including temporomandibular disorders, periodontal and/or chronic dental pain, trigeminal neuropathies, burning mouth syndrome, head and neck cancer pain, and other orofacial pain, to enable and accelerate the discovery and validation of therapeutic targets for these pain conditions.national center for complementary and integrative health (nccih): nccih is particularly interested in human genes, epigenetic elements, proteome, metabolome data using neural and associated non-neural (such as myofascial and musculoskeletal) tissues, which are potential therapeutic targets for complementary and integrative health approaches in the context of pain and suds. complementary interventions include dietary (e.g., special diets, dietary supplements, herbs, probiotics, and microbial-based therapies), psychological (e.g., meditation, hypnosis, music-based interventions, relaxation therapies), physical (e.g., acupuncture, massage, chiropractic manipulation, devices) approaches, or a combination of psychological and physical approaches (e.g., yoga, tai chi, dance therapies, some forms of art therapies). the dietary approaches include what have been previously categorized as natural products, whereas psychological and/or physical approaches encompass what have been commonly referred to as mind and body interventions.national cancer institute (nci): nci is interested in research on human genes, cellular phenotypes, and biomarkers related to cancer- or treatment-related pain conditions. examples of areas of interest include, but are not limited to, susceptibility to chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy, post-surgical pain, or cancer-induced bone pain, mechanisms underlying progression of chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy, post-surgical pain, cancer treatment-related pain or cancer-induced bone pain or predicting responses to different therapies.eunice kennedy shriver national institute of child health and human development (nichd) is particularly interested in applications relevant to (a) persistent pain of women with endometriosis, chronic pelvic pain, vulvodynia/vestibulodynia, dysmenorrhea, and other gynecologic pain syndromes, (b) pain (acute and chronic) after minor and major surgical procedures, and (c) pain conditions (acute and chronic) in children, women of reproductive age, pregnant and lactating individuals, people with physical disabilities, and health disparity populations (i.e. racial/ethnic groups, sexual and gender minorities, underserved rural and socioeconomically disadvantaged populations, people with limited english proficiency).research scope and organizational structure of the u19 centersto support the objectives of the precision human pain network, each u19 center is expected to include the following required cores: an administrative core, a human tissue procurement and processing core, and a data core. u19 centers may also include specialized resource cores; however these are optional. each u19 center is also expected to contain up to three research projects for collecting data on molecular signatures, cell types, and cellular function phenotypes or signatures associated with human pain signal processing, including, but not limited to specific pain types, conditions and/or diseases. overall, applicants should propose to use methods that have been demonstrated to generate high-quality data, to be cost-effective, and to have the capability to accurately and efficiently define cell types. scalable and multiplexed approaches are expected to enable a comprehensive cell type survey. in addition, applicants are encouraged to adopt technology platforms capable of acquiring multimodal datasets from the same cells with adequate throughput. examples of such approaches include fluorescence in situ hybridization (fish) combined with immunohistochemistry labeling to monitor both rna and protein molecules and track spatial expression information of genes related to pain, as well as collection of cell morphology and rnaseq data from individual neurons following electrophysiological recordings.administrative core (required) each u19 center must have an administrative core that will support the coordination of efforts across the research projects and cores within the center, as well as activities to advance integration into the broader precision human pain network. the effective management of a center project requires a significant commitment by the program director(s)/principal investigator(s) (pd/pi). a full-time program manager may in addition strengthen the center administration. this core will be responsible for organization, management, decision-making, and periodic evaluations of individual groups within the center, involvement of institutional and other resources, and shared publications. the administrative core is expected to create and implement administrative and leadership mechanisms that will foster effective interactions with other precision human pain network pds/pis and institutions to promote synergistic research efforts. the administrative core lead will also be expected to participate in meetings as part of the network’s steering committee (see section vi cooperative agreement terms and conditions for more information).human tissue procurement and processing core (required) each u19 center must have a human tissue procurement and processing core that will coordinate with individual research projects within the center as well as with other u19 centers within the precision human pain network on the procurement of human pain-associated tissues, including harmonization of tissue extraction procedures, storage, and processing, based on specific experimental types (e.g., dissociation, cell sorting, culturing, tissue slice preparations, tissue fixation for histologic and/or imaging analysis, etc.). applicants should adopt scalable experimental approaches that will maximize the discovery and classification of all pain-associated cell types in brain, brainstem, tg, sc, drg, and peripheral nerves. this core will be responsible for ensuring documented informed consent processes are in place that explicitly allows for future research use and broad data sharing; this may be part of a coordinated and standardized process across the network, as appropriate. the core leader, or their designate, will represent the center in a cross-network human pain-associated tissue procurement, processing and analysis sub-committee that will operate under the network’s steering committee to promote coordination and collaboration among all precision human pain network centers. this sub-committee will be responsible for the development and/or optimization of experimental protocols and procedures for: 1) procurement and processing of human tissues associated with pain signal transduction and transmission, for specific experimental and analytic needs, 2) primary cultures and co-cultures of human neurons and non-neuronal cells (e.g., ganglionic cells) from the collected tissue, 3) preparation of tissue slices for functional analysis, 4) fixation and processing of tissue for histological and imaging analysis, 5) dissemination of these human tissue procurement and processing protocols and procedures to pain research communities.data core (required) each u19 center must have a data core that will provide central data storage, management and information security services to all researchers within the center and will be responsible for ensuring the timely submission of data and data analyses to the u24 heal initiative: human pain-associated genes & cells data coordination and integration center (dcic) within the precision human pain network. the data core will also provide bioinformatics expertise and data integration and analysis support according to the center’s research objectives, including mining and integrating other existing data and information to fill knowledge gap(s). the data core may perform statistical analyses of single cell -omics and/or cellular function electrophysiologic signature data to identify cell types, discover unique cell type markers, predict spatiotemporal relations, and infer gene expression regulatory mechanisms underlying the role of specific cell types in pain signal transduction and transmission. the data core may also provide study design and statistical support/services for the researchers within the center. the data core leader, or their designate, will represent the center in a cross-precision human pain network data sub-committee that will operate under the network’s steering committee to promote coordination and collaboration among all precision human pain network centers, including data sharing, data harmonization, refinement of data standards, data analysis and integration, data mapping to common brain, spinal cord, ganglia and cellular coordinate systems, and data visualization. furthermore, it will closely work with the nih heal initiative’s data ecosystem to maximize sharing and dissemination of data and digital assets to the pain research and therapeutics development communities. resource core (optional) each u19 center may have up to two resource cores that are expected to generate, acquire, optimize, and adapt necessary tools and reagents for cellular and molecular characterizations and/or histological and imaging analyses. the core may also support technology improvements that will increase the efficiency and/or decrease the cost of generating comprehensive data on human pain-associated genes and cells. the adaptation of necessary and validated tools, reagents, and technologies should address limitations and gaps of those currently used as a benchmark against which proposed improvements or competitive advantages will be measured. possible improvements include throughput, sensitivity, selectivity, scalability, spatiotemporal resolution, and reproducibility in cellular and -omic analysesresearch projects (required) each u19 center is expected to contain up to three research projects to collect data on molecular signatures, cell types, and cellular function phenotypes or signatures, in order to generate comprehensive datasets for the discovery and characterization of functional genetic elements, epigenetic signatures, and molecular/cellular pathways that underlie human pain signal transduction, transmission, and processing, including, but not limited to specific pain types, conditions and/or diseases, and/or under conditions of chronic analgesic use, other drug use, suds and other co-morbid and/or overlapping pain conditions. each research project must be organized around a central dataset and research theme incorporating scalable and cross-validating methods and analyses wherever possible. goals for data production should be as comprehensive and complete as possible with a broad coverage of multiple different cell types and tissue structures/regions and adequate depth in characterizing multiple cellular properties. research objectives may include, but are not limited to:additional precision human pain network elements and concepts: the comprehensive datasets of functional genetic elements, epigenetic signatures, and molecular/cellular pathways generated by the precision human pain network will be an important and unique resource for use by the broader research community, and thus the following issues related to large-scale data and knowledgebase production are paramount to the success of the program.data quality. two of the cornerstones of science advancement are rigor in designing and performing scientific research and the ability to reproduce biomedical research findings (https://www.nih.gov/research-training/rigor-reproducibility). the precision human pain network is expected to establish stringent data quality standards, quality control and quality assurance processes for the experimental and statistical approaches, so that the data generated will be broadly referenced and used by the research community.data comprehensiveness. the data production goals should be as comprehensive as possible with a broad coverage and adequate depth in characterizing functional genetic elements, epigenetic signatures, and molecular/cellular pathways that underlie human pain signal transduction, transmission, and processing. in practice, achieving a comprehensive signature of human pain-associated genes and cells that include neurons, glia cells, and other cell types will require careful planning of workflow, strategic allocation of resources, and optimal lineup of complementary technologies. to ensure comprehensive coverage of cell diversity and avoid overcommitting resources to a limited number of tissue types, regions and cell types in the context of specific pain conditions and/or diseases, nih program staff may consider portfolio balance when making funding decisions and negotiating project milestones. the purpose is to establish a network with complementary capabilities and capacities toward generating a comprehensive functional mapping of human genes and cellular phenotypes underlying the heterogeneity, pathogenesis and susceptibility to specific pain conditions, including conditions of chronic analgesic or other drug use, suds and other co-morbid and/or overlapping pain conditions.data utility. the ultimate utility of precision human pain network data for the broad research community may reside in an effective integration of different data elements including molecular content, cell anatomy, and physiology to define a cell type. each element of data may be limited in its own value, but combined the data collected by individual projects should inform and cross validate each other to arrive at an integrative description closer to nature. rapid data exchange and integration are critical for defining a cell type and unveiling the organizational rules behind cellular makeup and pain transmission and processing circuits. precision human pain network centers are expected to abide by the agreed data sharing policy and process to ensure unhindered data exchange and sharing, coordinating with the u24 human pain-associated genes & cells data center and biomedical knowledgebase within the precision human pain network. in addition, all centers are expected to work closely with the nih heal initiative’s data ecosystem (https://heal.nih.gov/data/heal-data-ecosystem), to maximize sharing and dissemination of data and digital assets to the pain research and therapeutics development communities.production workflow. the ultimate long-term goal is to establish comprehensive functional mapping of human genes and cellular phenotypes underlying the heterogeneity, pathogenesis and susceptibility to specific pain conditions. the precision human pain network should attain a high level of production at an affordable cost by adopting scalable technology platforms and streamlined workflows. as with other large-scale data generation efforts, the precision human pain network centers are expected to have the capability to operate at scale at the inception of the project, establish adequate process control with quantitative quality metrics at key points in the production workflow, and have plans to improve production workflow and cost efficiency.milestones. success of the precision human pain network will be facilitated by the adoption of clear, quantitative milestones by each of the participating u19 centers as well as the dcic. applicants will propose annual milestones that reflect the center’s ability to produce data and overall progress towards the achievement of the center’s goals. prior to funding an application, nih program staff may contact the applicant to discuss the proposed milestones and any changes suggested by the review panel or program staff. applications lacking milestones will be deemed incomplete and will not be reviewed (see section iv.2).collectively, the accomplishments from these u19 centers will result in a high likelihood of identifying information at single gene and cellular levels on individual susceptibility to chronic pain in humans, as well as provide a path forward for the development and management of personalized therapeutic modalities for different human pain conditions or pathologies. successful establishment and execution of this collaborative network and the generation of an integrated knowledgebase through the dcic would also be highly informative for developing research and therapeutic development programs for human pain conditions and/or diseases.activities that are not responsive: the following research areas are considered outside the research scope of this foa, and such applications will be considered

review process. applications submitted to the nih in support of the nih mission are evaluated for scientific and technical merit through the nih peer review system.a meritorious u19 application is expected to be well-balanced in interdisciplinary science that spans expertise in pain biology, including human pain, high-throughput genome, proteome and metabolome experimentation and analysis, including single-cell analysis, human tissue processing, medium- and large-scale single-cell functional analysis, tissue histological and imaging analysis, bioinformatics, statistics, and data science. in addition, the proposed number and composition of research projects and cores are expected to adequately reflect the overall theme(s) of the center and requirements of the precision human pain network to achieve its goalsthe entire research application will receive one impact score based on critical consideration of all the components of the entire application. to guide the final scoring, reviewers will make interim assessment scores of the overall and each research project (scores 1-9), and each core (exceptional, adequate, or inadequate).reviewers will provide an overall impact score to reflect their assessment of the likelihood for the project to exert a sustained, powerful influence on the research field(s) involved, in consideration of the following review criteria and additional review criteria (as applicable for the project proposed).reviewers will consider each of the review criteria below in the determination of scientific merit, and give a separate score for each. an application does not need to be strong in all categories to be judged likely to have major scientific impact. for example, a project that by its nature is not innovative may be essential to advance a field.significancedoes the project address an important problem or a critical barrier to progress in the field? is the prior research that serves as the key support for the proposed

with the statutory provisions contained in section 872 of the duncan hunter national defense authorization act of fiscal year 2009 (public law 110-417), nih awards will be subject to the federal awardee performance and integrity information system (fapiis) requirements. fapiis requires federal award making officials to review and consider information about an applicant in the designated integrity and performance system (currently fapiis) prior to making an award. an applicant, at its option, may review information in the designated integrity and performance systems accessible through fapiis and comment on any information about itself that a federal agency previously entered and is currently in fapiis. the federal awarding agency will consider any comments by the applicant, in addition to other information in fapiis, in making a judgement about the applicant’s integrity, business ethics, and record of performance under federal awards when completing the review of risk posed by applicants as described in 45 cfr part 75.205 and 2 cfr part 200.206 “federal awarding agency review of risk posed by applicants.” this provision will apply to all nih grants and cooperative agreements except fellowships.the following special terms of award are in addition to, and not in lieu of, otherwise applicable u.s. office of management and budget (omb) administrative guidelines, u.s. department of health and human services (dhhs) grant administration regulations at 45 cfr parts 75 and 2 cfr part 200, and other hhs, phs, and nih grant administration policies. the administrative and funding instrument used for this program will be the cooperative agreement, an "assistance" mechanism (rather than an "acquisition" mechanism), in which substantial nih programmatic involvement with the recipientsis anticipated during the performance of the activities. under the cooperative agreement, the nih purpose is to support and stimulate the recipients' activities by involvement in and otherwise working jointly with the award recipients in a partnership role; it is not to assume direction, prime responsibility, or a dominant role in the activities. consistent with this concept, the dominant role and prime responsibility resides with the recipientsfor the project as a whole, although specific tasks and activities may be shared among the recipientsand the nih as defined below.the pd(s)/pi(s) will have the primary responsibilities as described below:nih staff have substantial programmatic involvement that is above and beyond the normal stewardship role in awards, as described below:areas of joint responsibility include:precision human pain network steering committee:the steering committee will be composed of the pd(s)/pi(s), project scientist(s) and external scientific panel members (experts to be named after award). the steering committee may also include designated representatives from the heal data sharing ecosystem, as appropriate. the steering committee will be established to help monitor progress, encourage improvements, and coordinate the production of human pain-associated genes, cellular function and tissue analysis datasets and resources through the precision human pain network. it is anticipated that additional coordination mechanisms might be set up with other u.s. and international groups that may join this effort. the precision human pain network steering committee members will meet periodically to plan and design activities, review, and discuss progress, and establish priorities and policies. a chair will be designated on a rotating basis as needed. each pd(s)/pi(s), and external scientific advisor will have one vote each and the nih will have one vote through the participation of the project scientist(s). the frequency of meetings will be determined by the project scientist(s) who will be responsible for scheduling the time and place and for preparing concise proceedings or minutes which will be delivered to the steering committee members within 30 days after the meeting. awardee members of the steering committee will be required to accept and implement policies approved by the steering committee.the precision human pain network steering committee will:external scientific panel (esp):the esp will provide recommendations to the nih heal initiative precision human pain network project team and the precision human pain network about the progress and scientific direction of all components of the program. the esp will be composed of four to six senior scientists who represent broad research community and have relevant expertise, although the membership may be enlarged permanently or on an ad hoc basis as needed. the esp will meet at least twice a year; some meetings may be conducted by telephone conference. at least once a year, there will be a joint meeting with the steering committee for the members of both esp and steering committees to interact directly. twice a year the esp will make recommendations regarding progress of the precision human pain network and present advice to the nih heal initiative precision human pain network project team about changes, if any, that may be necessary in the heal initiative precision human pain program.dispute resolution:any disagreements that may arise in scientific or programmatic matters (within the scope of the award) between award recipients and the nih may be brought to dispute resolution. a dispute resolution panel composed of three members will be convened. it will have three members: a designee of the steering committee chosen without nih staff voting, one nih designee, and a third designee with expertise in the relevant area who is chosen by the other two; in the case of individual disagreement, the first member may be chosen by the individual awardee. this special dispute resolution procedure does not alter the awardee's right to appeal an adverse action that is otherwise appealable in accordance with phs regulation 42 cfr part 50, subpart d and dhhs regulation 45 cfr part 16.data management and sharingnote: the nih policy for data management and sharing is effective for due dates on or after january 25, 2023.consistent with the nih policy for data management and sharing, when data management and sharing is applicable to the award, recipients will be required to adhere to the data management and sharing requirements as outlined in the nih grants policy statement. upon the approval of a data management and sharing plan, it is required for recipients to implement the plan as described.when multiple years are involved, recipients will be required to submit the research performance progress report (rppr) annually and financial statements as required in the nih grants policy statement.a final rppr, invention statement, and the expenditure data portion of the federal financial report are required for closeout of an award, as described in the nih grants policy statement. nih foas outline intended research goals and objectives. post award, nih will review and measure performance based on the details and outcomes that are shared within the rppr, as described at 45 cfr part 75.301 and 2 cfr part 200.301.the federal funding accountability and transparency act of 2006 (transparency act), includes a requirement for recipients of federal grants to report information about first-tier subawards and executive compensation under federal assistance awards issued in fy2011 or later. all recipients of applicable nih grants and cooperative agreements are required to report to the federal subaward reporting system (fsrs) available at www.fsrs.gov on all subawards over the threshold. see the nih grants policy statement for additional information on this reporting requirement.in accordance with the regulatory requirements provided at 45 cfr 75.113and 2 cfr part 200.113 and appendix xii to 45 cfr part 75 and 2 cfr part 200, recipients that have currently active federal grants, cooperative agreements, and procurement contracts from all federal awarding agencies with a cumulative total value greater than $10,000,000 for any period of time during the period of performance of a federal award, must report and maintain the currency of information reported in the system for award management (sam)about civil, criminal, and administrative proceedings in connection with the award or performance of a federal award that reached final disposition within the most recent five-year period. the recipient must also make semiannual disclosures regarding such proceedings. proceedings information will be made publicly available in the designated integrity and performance system (currently fapiis). this is a statutory requirement under section 872 of public law 110-417, as amended (41 u.s.c. 2313). as required by section 3010 of public law 111-212, all information posted in the designated integrity and performance system on or after april 15, 2011, except past performance reviews required for federal procurement contracts, will be publicly available. full reporting requirements and procedures are found in appendix xii to 45 cfr part 75and 2 cfr
