investigators seeking to redirect or expand their research programs through the acquisition of new skills and knowledge in the area of firearm mortality and injury prevention research, which is beyond and complementary to their current areas of expertise. the program will support research training and career development experiences and a small-scale research project that will provide experienced investigators with the scientific competencies required to conduct research relevant to firearm morality and injury prevention research. eligible candidates are independent investigators at any faculty rank or level.the proposed project must be related to the programmatic interests of one or more of the participating nih institutes and centers (ics) based on their scientific missions.this funding opportunity announcement (foa) is designed specifically for applicants proposing to serve as the lead investigator of an independent clinical trial, a clinical trial feasibility study, or a separate ancillary study to an existing trial, as part of their research and career development. applicants not planning an independent clinical trial, or proposing to gain research experience in a clinical trial led by another investigator, must apply to companion foa (par-23-108).not applicableall applications are due by 5:00 pm local time of applicant organization.applications are encouraged to apply early to allow adequate time to make any corrections to errors found in the application during the submission process by the due date.not applicableit is critical that applicants follow the instructions in the career development (k) instructions in the sf424 (r&r) application guide, except where instructed to do otherwise (in this foa or in a notice from the nih guide for grants and contracts). conformance to all requirements (both in the application guide and the foa) is required and strictly enforced. applicants must read and follow all application instructions in the application guide as well as any program-specific instructions noted in section iv. when the program-specific instructions deviate from those in the application guide, follow the program-specific instructions. applications that do not comply with these instructions may be delayed or not accepted for review.the overall goal of the nih research career development program is to help ensure that a diverse pool of highly trained scientists is available in appropriate scientific disciplines to address the nation's biomedical, behavioral, and clinical research needs. nih institutes and centers (ics) support a variety of mentored and non-mentored career development award programs designed to foster the transition of new investigators to research independence and to support established investigators in achieving specific objectives. candidates should review the different career development (k) award programs to determine the best program to support their goals. more information about career programs may be found at the nih extramural training mechanisms website.the objective of the career enhancement award for experienced investigators (k18) is to provide support for experienced scientists who either wish to broaden their scientific capabilities or to make changes in their research careers by acquiring new research skills or knowledge. the purpose of this foa is to provide such investigators with support for an intensive period of mentored research experience to acquire new research capabilities in research areas supported by the sponsoring nih institute(s)/center(s). such experiences will afford candidate investigators protected time to: 1) enrich and expand their expertise and research programs through retooling in new techniques, emerging technologies, and/or scientific areas; and/or 2) redirect their research programs in new trajectories; and/or 3) catalyze research collaborations in new research directions. it is expected that this initiative will lead to new and/or augmented research programs competitive for nih funding.the goal of this k18 initiative is to enhance research workforce capacity as rapidly as possible by supporting a program that will help experienced investigators in related or complementary fields to gain research expertise in the field of firearm injury and mortality prevention. the purpose of enhancing workforce capacity is to increase the number and breadth of areas covered by funded nih research project grants (rpgs) that address the pressing public health challenge of firearm related injury and mortality. as noted above, applications should focus on enhanced research expertise and skills needed to conduct firearm injury and mortality prevention research as it relates to a range of types of violence and injury. topics of focus include but are not limited to, accidental injury, intimate partner violence/dating violence, sexual assault, self-directed violence and suicide, child maltreatment, elder maltreatment, youth violence, hate crimes, community violence, and gang violence.backgroundviolence is defined by the world health organization as: “the intentional use of physical force or power, threatened or actual, against oneself, another person, or against a group or community, that either results in or has a high likelihood of resulting in injury, death, psychological harm, maldevelopment, or deprivation.” both direct and indirect (e.g., witnessing) violent victimization events are associated with not only physical injury or mortality, but also a range of acute and chronic physical, mental and behavioral health conditions, such as obesity, cardiovascular disease, asthma, substance use disorders, and sleep disturbance.when firearms are involved with violent events (including suicide, intimate partner violence, child or elder maltreatment, youth and gang related violence, sexual assault, and hate crimes), the risk for injury and mortality increases. firearm related injury and mortality, in particular, constitute an urgent public health crisis with firearms being involved in almost 80% of homicides and over half of all suicides. from 2019 to 2020, the firearm homicide rate increased about 35%, to its highest recorded rate in over 25 years. in addition, the firearm suicide rate remained consistently high from 2019 to 2020 with increases in some populations. in 2020, firearm-related injuries became the leading cause of injury death for children and youth ages 1-19. the increase in firearm-related deaths from 2019-2020 further widened disparities by race, ethnicity and poverty. for example, firearm homicides among black individuals increased by 39% and firearm suicide rate increased by 42% among american indian and alaska native persons. homicide is also a significant cause of maternal mortality, as a recent study using national death certificate data found that pregnant women in the united states died by homicide (most often from partners) more often than they died of pregnancy-related causes. in addition, other populations including sexual and gender minority (sgm) and people with disabilities bear a disproportionate burden of firearm related injury and mortality.thus, there is a critical need for a robust and well-equipped research workforce to better understand and address this critical public health issue. more investigators are needed to conduct community-engaged and informed research that provides an evidence base for communities, policy makers, service systems, and others involved in responding to the need for a range of empirically supported, effective, high-quality, cost-effective interventions to prevent firearm-related injury and mitigate its impact.program objectivein addition to preparing the awardee to apply for independent funding to conduct research on firearm injury and mortality prevention, it is expected that this initiative will also lead to new research collaborations that could lead to future nih funding. this short-term (up to 24 months) period of mentored research experience should expand the investigator's current expertise and lead to new knowledge and skills and potential new collaborators. the research career enhancement experience may be conducted in a different department within the candidate's home institution or in a different institutional setting from the location where the candidate holds their primary appointment. mentoring may occur in-person, virtually, or in combination. the research experience proposed must have the potential to augment the candidate’s research capabilities substantially and provide new research opportunities and benefits that would not be achievable through a collaborative research grant with the mentor(s). the research career enhancement experience should be tailored to the individual needs and level of experience of the candidate. the career enhancement plan may include (1) a didactic academic enrichment plan, e.g., coursework, seminars, journal clubs, etc., and (2) a small-scale research project focused on firearm injury and mortality prevention. the research project is expected to expand the candidate's expertise in conducting firearm injury and mortality prevention research.applicants are expected to identify one or more research mentors with relevant expertise in applicant knowledge-gap areas. the mentor(s) must be established, well-qualified, and willing to support the applicant's short-term research career development experience. the candidate and the proposed mentor(s) should not already have established, longstanding collaborations at the time of the application. candidates are expected to either establish new collaborative arrangements or strengthen and enhance relatively new or developing collaborations on a research project on firearm mortality and injury prevention research.examples of novel skill combinations that might result from the mentored training include, but are not limited to:scale and scope of the research projectthis foa is designed specifically for applicants proposing to serve as the lead investigator of an independent clinical trial, a clinical trial feasibility study, or a separate ancillary clinical trial, as part of their research and career development.accordingly, examples of research projects include, but are not limited to pilot studies in preparation for a full scale r01 clinical trial research project on firearm injury and mortality prevention that will develop, implement and test:the research project should expand the candidate's direct experience with individuals, families, and communities experiencing or at risk for experiencing high levels of firearm injury and mortality and/or with the systems (e.g., healthcare, education, legal/justice) that work to prevent such violence or injury and its impacts over time.applicants are strongly encouraged to consider the use of common data elements when feasible and appropriate, including measures outlined in the phenx toolkit (www.phenxtoolkit.org).the structure and budgetary constraints associated with this career enhancement award will limit the scope of the research that can be achieved. applicants will need to address the feasibility of completing their project within these constraints.prospective applicants are strongly encouraged to contact the scientific contacts listed for additional guidance about ic-specific priorities in firearm injury and mortality prevention research as outlined in not-od-23-039 firearm injury and mortality prevention research.for nimh, priorities for research on violence in the context of mental illness are also detailed in not-mh-22-095 nimh priorities on research on aggression and violence against others.note: this funding opportunity announcement (foa) is designed specifically for candidates proposing to serve as the lead investigator of an independent clinical trial, a clinical trial feasibility study, or a separate ancillary clinical trial, as part of their research and career development. those not planning an independent clinical trial, or proposing to gain research experience in a clinical trial led by another investigator, must apply to companion foa (par-23-108).nih defines a clinical trial as "a research study in which one or more human subjects are prospectively assigned to one or more interventions (which may include placebo or other control) to evaluate the effects of those interventions on health-related biomedical or behavioral outcomes." (not-od-15-015).nih not only supports trials of safety and efficacy, it also supports mechanistic exploratory studies that meet the definition of a clinical trial and are designed to explore or understand a biological or behavioral process, the pathophysiology of a disease, or the mechanism of action of an intervention. these studies may focus on basic and/or translational discovery research in healthy human subjects and in human subjects who are affected by the pathophysiology of diseases and disorders. by addressing basic questions and concepts in biology, behavior, and pathophysiology, these studies may provide insight into understanding human diseases and disorders along with potential treatments or preventive strategies. nih also supports biomarker studies that meet the definition of a clinical trial and that may provide information about physiological function, target engagement of novel therapeutics, and/or the impact of therapeutics on treatment response. nih thus supports studies that meet the definition of clinical trials (as noted above) but do not seek to establish safety, clinical efficacy, effectiveness, clinical management, and/or implementation of preventive, therapeutic, and services interventions.additional guidance'research proposed in applications must be ideologically and politically unbiased as defined in the nih grants policy statement (gps) sections 4.1.10 and 4.1.17.nih funds may not be used, in whole or in part, to advocate or promote gun control or to support lobbying activities, as outlined in section 4 of the nih gpsapplicants to nimh please note: nimh support for clinical trials research follows an experimental therapeutics approach, whereby clinical trials are designed, not only to test the intervention effects on outcomes of interest, but also to inform understanding of the intervention’s mechanisms of action. as such, applications that propose to develop and/or test the efficacy/effectiveness of preventive, therapeutic or services interventions must include specification of the intervention target(s)/mechanism(s) and assessment of intervention-induced changes in the presumed target mechanism(s) that are hypothesized to account for the intervention outcome. see the nimh guidance for mentored k applicants proposing clinical trials, which will apply to nimh-focused applications submitted for this foa.investigators proposing nih-defined clinical trials may refer to the research methods resources website for information about developing statistical methods and study designs.see section viii. other information for award authorities and regulations.grant: a support mechanism providing money, property, or both to an eligible entity to carry out an approved project or activity.required: only accepting applications that propose an independent clinical trial(s).the number of awards is contingent upon nih appropriations and the submission of a sufficient number of meritorious applications.the total project period may not exceed 2 years.nih will provide 6 to 9 months salary and fringe benefits for the award recipient. further guidance on budgeting for career development salaries is provided in the sf424 (r&r) application guide.in addition, the candidate may derive additional compensation for effort associated with other federal sources or awards provided the total salary derived from all federal sources does not exceed the maximum legislated salary rate (see http://grants.nih.gov/grants/policy/salcap_summary.html) and the total percent effort does not exceed 100%. see also not-od-17-094.nih will contribute $50,000 per year toward the research development costs of the award recipient, which must be justified and consistent with the stage of development of the candidate and the proportion of time to be spent in research or career development activities.these funds may be used for the following expenses: (a) tuition and fees related to career development; (b) research-related expenses, such as supplies, equipment and technical personnel; (c) travel to research meetings or training; and (d) statistical services including personnel and computer time.salary for mentors, secretarial and administrative assistants, etc. is not allowed.1. eligible applicantshigher education institutionsthe following types of higher education institutions

grant or contract with one or more specific aims related to firearm mortality or injury prevention are not eligible for this funding opportunity.candidates for the k18 award must have a research or health-professional doctoral degree. this award is intended for well-established investigators who have established records of independent, peer-reviewed federal or private research grant funding. applicants are not required to have active research grant support at the time of application for this award.2. cost sharing3. additional information on eligibilityapplicant organizations may submit more than one application, provided that each application is scientifically distinct, and each is from a different candidate.the nih will not accept duplicate or highly overlapping applications under review at the same time per 2.3.7.4 submission of resubmission application. an individual may not have two or more competing nih career development applications pending review concurrently. in addition, nih will not accept:candidates may submit research project grant (rpg) applications concurrently with the k application. however, any concurrent rpg application may not have substantial scientific and/or budgetary overlap with the career award application. k award recipients are encouraged to obtain funding from nih or other federal sources either as a pd/pi on a competing research grant award or cooperative agreement, or as project leader on a competing multi-project award as described in not-od-08-065.at the time of award, the candidate must have a “full-time” appointment at the academic institution. candidates are required to commit a minimum of 50% of full time professional effort (i.e. a minimum of 6 months) candidates may engage in other duties as part of the remaining 25% of their full-time professional effort not covered by this award, as long as such duties do not interfere with or detract from the proposed career development program.candidates who have va appointments may not consider part of the va effort toward satisfying the full time requirement at the applicant institution. candidates with va appointments should contact the staff person in the relevant institute or center prior to preparing an application to discuss their eligibility.after the receipt of the award, adjustments to the required level of effort may be made in certain circumstances. see not-od-18-156 and nih grants policy statement, section 12.3.6.4 temporary adjustments to the percent effort requirement for more details.mentor(s)before submitting the application,
