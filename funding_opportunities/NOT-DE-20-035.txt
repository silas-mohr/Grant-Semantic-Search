Notice of Special Interest: Administrative Supplements to Support Dentist Scientists Post Specialty or Residency to Develop Expertise in Dental, Oral and Craniofacial Research
october 19, 2020pa-20-272 - administrative supplements to existing nih grants and cooperative agreements (parent admin supp clinical trial optional)national institute of dental and craniofacial research (nidcr)the purpose of the nidcr dentist scientist administrative supplement program is to enhance the research careers of dentist-scientists who can contribute vital clinical perspectives to dental, oral and craniofacial research projects, and to build and sustain a dentist-scientist research workforce dedicated to improving dental, oral and craniofacial health.the program will provide supplemental funds to active nidcr research grants to support mentored research experiences for outstanding early career dentist-scientists who have recently completed dental specialty or residency training. the program is intended to accelerate the candidate’s transition from primarily clinical activities to predominantly research activities by providing protected time to develop or update research skills, formulate a research career plan, generate preliminary data and seek independent funding.dentist scientist candidates for this program are expected to contribute substantially to on-going research by conducting well-defined projects that are within scope of the goals and objectives of the parent grant. the candidate’s research experience is expected to be guided by an experienced investigator(s) and provide a foundation for the candidate’s future research independence. mentors are expected to work with candidates to develop research experience plans that include the preparation of an independent grant application for nidcr support and are anticipated to enhance the candidate’s successful competition for independent research support.an initial request for one year of supplement support will be allowed, with the expectation that the candidate will make research progress and begin preparation of a grant application. an application for a second consecutive year of supplement support will be considered if progress in the initial year is demonstrated, and the need for an additional year of support to achieve the proposed career development goals and submission of an application for an independent support is strongly justified.eligible applicants (program director/principal investigator)pds/pis of active nidcr dp2, r01, r21, r35, r37, r42, r43, r44, u01, ug3,and uh3 grants are eligible to apply if there is at least one year of support remaining in the project period, excluding any no-cost extension phase, at time of supplement award.only one supplement application will be considered per pd/pi, even if the pd/pi has multiple qualifying awards. for supplements to parent grants that include multiple pds/pis, the supplement should be requested by the contact pd/pi and submitted by the awardee institution of the parent grant.pds/pis must have identified an eligible candidate who meets the criteria described below at the time of application. the candidate may be affiliated with either the applicant institution or another university or institution.mentorsthe application must identify a primary mentor who is associated with the parent grant and a dentist scientist mentor who may also serve as the primary mentor, if applicable. the pd/pi of the award is not required to be the primary mentor, but the primary mentor is expected to have a defined role on the project. for multiple pi awards, the mentor of the candidate may be any or all of the pds/pis on the award. other mentors may be included as needed for the project proposed. the pd/pi of the parent grant must concur with the supplement application.mentors are expected to be experienced investigators and have experience mentoring early career dentist scientist or other clinician scientists. if more than one mentor is proposed, each mentor’s role and relationship to the candidate in the proposed research experience plan must be clearly defined. each mentor’s mentoring track record, including individuals previously mentored (preferably at the candidate’s career level) and their current positions, if applicable, should be described. if the primary mentor is a relatively junior faculty member and has modest research and mentoring experience, including an experienced and more senior co-mentor may be helpful.eligible candidatescandidates must meet the following eligibility requirements: (1) must have a dds/dmd or equivalent degree, or have a dds/dmd-phd or equivalent research doctoral degree, (2) must have previous research experience at the predoctoral or postdoctoral career level at the time of application, (3) must have recently completed or be in the final year of dental specialty or residency training, (4) must be able to devote a minimum of 75% professional effort to the proposed research experience with the remaining effort devoted to activities related to the development of a successful research career, and (5) must include plans to develop an application for individual support, such as an nidcr mentored research career development award (k01, k08, k23), a career transition award (k99/r00), a research project grant, or other type of nidcr independent award to support dental, oral and craniofacial research.nidcr is committed to increasing diversity in the dental, oral and craniofacial research workforce and is committed to recruiting scientists who have different backgrounds and life experiences whose participation is vital to accomplishing nidcr’s mission. individuals from underrepresented racial and ethnic groups, and individuals with disabilities or from disadvantage backgrounds (see not-od-20-031) are always encouraged to apply for nih support.application and submission informationapplications
