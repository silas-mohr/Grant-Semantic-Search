harassment based on being a member of a racial, ethnic, sexual, or gender minority group; disability-based aggression; aggressions associated with religion; and other similar circumstances.in all cases, the proposed research experience must be within the scope of the nih-supported grant project and be an integral part of the approved, ongoing research of the parent award. the candidate’s proposed mentored research experience must have the potential to contribute significantly to the research career development of the candidate. the individual supported under this supplemental award must be allowed to act as a full participant in the research project and must be given an opportunity to update and enhance their research capabilities. this will allow the candidate to begin the process of re-establishing a career as a productive, competitive investigator. supplemental awards are expected to strengthen the existing research program and reflect the overall programmatic balance and priorities of the nih funding program.special note: because nih ics may have varying degrees of flexibility in implementing the re-entry/re-integration program, potential applicants should consult with the contact at the nih awarding component at the earliest possible stage to discuss their unique situation (see table of ic-specific information, requirements, and staff contacts). this funding opportunity announcement (foa) is designed specifically for applicants proposing research that does not involve leading an independent clinical trial, a clinical trial feasibility study, or an ancillary study to a clinical trial. applicants to this foa are permitted to propose research experience in a clinical trial led by a mentor or co-mentor.number of applicationsa parent grant may support only one individual on a re-entry/re-integration supplement award. candidates may receive support from only one nih award at a time but maybe supported by more than one supplement during the development of their research careers.eligible candidates for the supplement programcandidates for the re-entry supplements will have a doctoral degree, such as m.d., d.d.s., ph.d., o.d., d.v.m., or equivalent. in some nih ics, pre-doctoral students, including those enrolled in dual-degree programs (e.g. md-phd, dds-phd, dvm-phd) may also be eligible to apply. please consult the table of ic-specific information, requirements, and staff contactspost-doctoral and predoctoral students are eligible to apply for re-integration supplements to allow them to transition to a new, safe and supportive research environment and complete their graduate degree.all candidates must be planning a career in biomedical, behavioral, clinical, translational, or social science research. candidates who have begun the re-entry/re-integration process through a fellowship, traineeship, or similar support at the time of application, are not eligible to apply for this program. awards are limited to citizens or non-citizen nationals of the united states or to individuals who have been lawfully admitted for permanent residence (i.e., in possession of a permanent resident card, form i-551) at the time of the award.qualifying circumstancescandidates with a doctoral degree-seeking re-entry: in general, the duration of the career interruption should be at least six months for re-entry purposes, and no more than eight years. examples of qualifying interruptions for re-entry supplements include, but are not limited to: a complete or partial hiatus from research activities for child-rearing; an incapacitating illness or injury of the candidate, spouse, partner, or a member of the immediate family; job offers rescinded as a result of natural disasters or public health emergencies (e.g., covid-19), relocation to accommodate a spouse, partner, or another close family member; pursuit of non-research endeavors that would permit earlier repayment of debt incurred in obtaining a doctoral degree; and military service. the program is not intended to support additional graduate training and is not intended to support career changes from non-research to research careers for individuals without prior research training. generally, the candidate should be in a complete or partial hiatus from research activities at the time of application and should not be engaged in full-time paid research activities.because nih ics may have varying degrees of flexibility in implementing the re-entry program, potential applicants should consult with the contact at the nih awarding component at the earliest possible stage to discuss their unique situation (see table of ic-specific information, requirements, and staff contacts)re-integration: candidates with doctoral degrees and graduate students seeking to transition out of unsafe research environments because of discriminatory and unlawful harassment are eligible to apply for re-integration supplements as soon as supplement support to continue research training in a new and safe research environment has been identifiedeligible awardsfor eligible awards, see the listing of activity codes under pa-18-592. pd(s)/pi(s) at domestic institutions who hold an active grant or cooperative agreement may be eligible to submit a request for an administrative supplement to the awarding component of the parent grant. the p20, p30, and p60 award mechanisms are eligible for supplements only if they contain research components. in all cases, the mechanism of support under this program is the supplemental award.expected time commitmentadministrative supplements provided under this program may be for either part-time or full-time (equivalent to 12 person-months) support for the candidate, and all supported time must be devoted to updating and enhancing research skills and competencies. proposed part-time appointments may not be less than 50% effort (equivalent to 6 person-months).application and submission informationapplications for this initiative must be submitted using the following opportunity or its subsequent reissued equivalent.when developing applications in response to this nosi, all instructions in the sf424 (r&r) application guide and pa-20-272 must be followed, with the following additions:application review informationadministrative supplements do not receive peer review. instead, the administrative criteria described below will be considered in the administrative evaluation process.the staff of the nih awarding component will evaluate requests for a supplement to determine its overall merit. the following general criteria will be usedbudget and period of supportnih staff will consider whether the budget and the requested period of support are fully justified and reasonable in relation to the proposed research.overall impactnih staff will consider the ability of the proposed supplement activities to increase or preserve the parent award’s overall impact within the original scope of award:the staff of the nih awarding component will review requests for a supplement to determine their overall merit. only the administrative review criteria described below will be considered in the review process:pis are encouraged to contact the program staff of the awarding component for specific ic requirements (see table of ic-specific information, requirements, and staff contacts).applicants are strongly encouraged to notify the program contact of the parent award that a request has been submitted in response to this nosi to facilitate efficient processing of the application.we encourage inquiries concerning this funding opportunity and welcome the opportunity to answer questions from potential applicants.application submission contactsera service desk (questions regarding assist, era commons registration, submitting and tracking an application, documenting system problems that threaten submission by the due date, post submission issues)finding help online: http://grants.nih.gov/support/ (preferred method of contact)telephone: 301-402-7469 or 866-504-9552 (toll free)grants.gov customer support (questions regarding grants.gov registration and submission, downloading forms and application packages)contact center telephone: 800-518-4726email: support@grants.govgrantsinfo (questions regarding application instructions and process, finding nih grant resources)email: grantsinfo@nih.gov (preferred method of contact)telephone: 301-945-7573please direct all other inquiries to:xenia t. tigno, ph.d., m.s. office of research on women's health (orwh) telephone: 301-480-1145 email:xenia.tigno@nih.govweekly toc for this announcement nih funding opportunities and noticesnote: for help accessing pdf, rtf, ms word, excel, powerpoint, audio or video files, see help downloading files.
