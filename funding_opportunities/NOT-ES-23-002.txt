however, the consequential biological and adverse effects are not well understood. recognizing the emerging concerns associated with exposure to mps or nps from diverse routes of exposure, niehs seeks to promote research to understand potential health impacts of mps and nps. due to the complexity associated with physical and chemical properties, niehs strongly recommends studies aimed at understanding biological effects to include mps/nps with defined physical and chemical properties.research objectivesthis notice of special interest seeks to support research to gain comprehensive understanding of the physiochemical characterization, exposure, and related human health effects of mps and nps. specific topics of research interest include, but are not limited to the following:exposure assessmenthealth effectsit is highly recommended that the proposed biological, risk assessment, adverse effects and/or health effects studies are well controlled, special emphasis is placed on the characterization of the mps or nps species for the size, shape and type, and consideration is given to environmentally relevant concentrations and most important characteristics of the mps or nps. where possible, standardized approaches should be used, and physically relevant assays should be applied. cross-disciplinary approaches involving diverse team expertise are ideal and necessary to accomplish these research objectives, thus it is highly recommended that the applications include team of investigators with multidisciplinary expertise.application and submission informationthis notice applies to due dates on or after februray 5, 2023 and subsequent receipt dates through november 16, 2027.submit applications for this initiative using one of the following funding opportunity announcements (foas) or any reissues of these announcement through the expiration date of this notice.pa-20-185 - research project grant (parent r01 clinical trial not allowed)pa-20-195 - nih exploratory/developmental research grant program (parent r21 clinical trial not allowed)pa-20-196 - nih exploratory/developmental research grant program (parent r21 basic experimental studies with humans required)all instructions in the sf424 (r&r) application guide and the funding opportunity announcement used for submission must be followed, with the following additions:applications nonresponsive to terms of this nosi will not be considered for the nosi initiative.scientific/research contact(s)lingamanaidu v. ravichandran, ph.dnational institute of environmental health sciences (niehs)telephone: 984-287-3309email: lingamanaidu.ravichandran@nih.govweekly toc for this announcement nih funding opportunities and noticesnote: for help accessing pdf, rtf, ms word, excel, powerpoint, audio or video files, see help downloading files.
