institute of mental health (nimh)purposethe national institute of mental health is issuing this notice to highlight interest in receiving implementation research grant applications designed in partnership with domestic and global service providers. these applications should target the unique needs in jurisdictions, both in cities and rural areas, that have been disproportionally affected by the hiv/aids epidemic in the us, and globally.backgroundthere is consensus among hiv/aids leaders in government, service, research, and the hiv/aids community that the goals set by domestic and global hiv/aids policy-makers to reduce incident hiv-infections are achievable for hiv testing, pre-exposure prophylaxis (prep) initiation, treatment initiation, and viral suppression. there are now numerous examples where the combination of political will, adequate financing and human resources, access to prevention and treatment tools, targeted deployment of evidence-based intervention, and community mobilization and partnerships has resulted in 80-90% rates of population-level viral suppression. notably, these successes have been achieved at country, province/state, city, and local levels. to continue to effectively implement evidence-based hiv prevention and treatment tools at scale, implementation science studies are needed to better understand the process at multiple levels; for example, context, culture, systems, organizations, providers, support staff, consumers and family members, and policy makers. each of these factors and stakeholders can influence the adoption, adaptation, integration, scale-up and sustainability of effective tools and interventions.however, to maintain these rates and to replicate these successes domestically and globally, the correct combination of efficacious behavioral, social, and biomedical interventions for hiv prevention and treatment must be taken to scale in places where critical components and supports are not optimal. moreover, in some communities, there are oppositional forces and barriers that make achievement of hiv prevention and treatment goals even more challenging.the us strategy for hiv prevention and treatment focuses on maximizing hiv diagnoses, initiation and sustainment of effective hiv treatment as early as possible, deploying prep and other effective prevention tools to those at highest risk for hiv, and responding and containing outbreaks of hiv infection when/where they occur. success of these strategies depends on partnerships among local and state health departments, communities, service providers, and research institutions. this notice seeks to strengthen the collaboration between nih research grantees and the service delivery efforts of the federal agencies collaborating on this effort. this notice encourages implementation research to advance the science and enhance the service delivery of the centers for disease control and prevention (cdc), the hiv/aids bureau of the health resources services administration (hrsa), the substance abuse and mental health services administration (samhsa), the indian health service (ihs), the u.s. department of veterans affairs (va), and state, city, and local public health departments.globally, hiv/aids prevention and treatment intervention targets are outlined in the pepfar 3.0 strategy (https://www.pepfar.gov/documents/organization/234744.pdf) which underscores the importance of doing the “right things, in the right places” to curb the epidemic. nih-funded hiv/aids implementation science should correspond to the most urgent needs in the hiv/aids service community. as described above, implementation science to address these needs should address multiple levels of influence for adaptation, integration, scale-up and sustainability, and research must be coordinated with public health leadership and providers. research is especially encouraged in collaboration with the entities and service platforms that provide the hiv/aids prevention and treatment that will achieve the 90/90/90 goals: i.e., pepfar, cdc, hrsa, who, usaid, unaids, and other relevant ministry of health (moh) - supported public health providers.a guiding principle for targeted implementation science is that research teams are required to have academic and public health collaboration with service providers for the proposed research, in order to optimize the match of the research directions with local needs, and to optimize the public health impact of the research implementation and findings.areas of
