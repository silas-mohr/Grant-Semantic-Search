regulations.every day, millions of u.s. workers go to their jobs, expecting to return home healthy and safe. the workplace environment can have a significant impact on a worker’s physical and psychological health. depending on the job, a worker may be at risk for many different kinds of injuries and illnesses or even death. work-related illnesses are often significantly underestimated because of the difficulty of recognizing or associating illness or disease with past occupational exposures. in 2016, private industry employers reported approximately 2.9 million nonfatal workplace injuries and illnesses, according to estimates from the survey of occupational injuries and illnesses (soii) conducted by the u.s. bureau of labor statistics (bls). in addition, a report from the census of fatal occupational injuries (cfoi) by the bls indicates that there were 5,190 fatal work injuries in the united states in 2016. work-related injuries, illnesses, and deaths are very costly to american society. in 2015, employers spent $94.8 billion on workers' compensation (national academy of social insurance data). despite successes in reducing fatal and nonfatal occupational-related injuries and illnesses in recent years, the need for continued research and intervention activities in occupational safety and health (osh) remains essential.the national institute for occupational safety and health (niosh) is an agency operating under the centers for disease control and prevention (cdc), with the mission of generating new knowledge in the field of occupational safety and health and transferring that knowledge into practice to prevent worker injury, illness, and death. to accomplish this mission, niosh conducts and funds scientific research; develops methods to prevent occupational hazards; develops guidance and authoritative recommendations; translates scientific knowledge into products and services; disseminates information; identifies factors underlying work-related disease and injury; and responds to requests for workplace health hazard evaluations. to learn more about niosh, visit about niosh.niosh organizes its research programs into sector and cross-sector programs based on the framework provided by the national occupational research agenda (nora), a partnership program designed to stimulate innovative research and improved workplace practices.niosh supports research objectives such as the following:the k01 grant mechanism provides "protected time" for an intensive, supervised (mentored) career development experience in occupational health and safety research. this can facilitate the transition of junior research scientists from the mentored to the independent stages of their careers in occupational health and safety research. by providing support for the critical transition period between postdoctoral training and independent r01 funding for investigators, niosh hopes to foster the careers of these investigators, who are vital for the future excellence of occupational safety and health research endeavors. applicants must justify the need for a period of mentored research experience and convincingly describe how the proposed period of support will substantially enhance their careers as independent investigators.the united states public health service (phs) is committed to achieving nationwide improvements in health for a society in which all people live long, healthy lives. the vision, mission, and goals are found in healthy people 2020 at https://www.healthypeople.gov/. the objectives of healthy people 2020 related to occupational safety and health (osh) are primarily addressed through the national occupational research agenda (nora). nora, established by niosh and its partners to stimulate research and improve workplace practices, provides a framework to guide osh research. the goal of niosh research programs is to support relevant, high quality, and effective projects that demonstrate impact in reducing occupational disease and injury. detailed information about the nora program portfolio can be found at http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/programs/.niosh programs support research that addresses worker safety, accident prevention, and health concerns across a wide spectrum of industries and occupations, and approaches. the approaches include basic research through translation research. the latter approach takes research knowledge and puts it to use by promoting engineering controls, new technologies, and communication products. through this announcement, niosh encourages qualified applicants to submit applications that will reduce or prevent occupational injury, illness, and death. these applications can be targeted to particular worker populations or to workers in broad spectrums of the work environment.niosh has a long history of funding extramural research covering a highly diverse range of topics and approaches related to occupational safety and health research. ongoing funding opportunities such as described in this announcement provide grant support for investigator-initiated research, small research projects, exploratory developmental research, and/or career-development awards for mentored research scientists. through funding in these areas, niosh successfully supports advancements in knowledge in the field of occupational safety and health and the transfer of knowledge into practice. more information can be found at the niosh office of extramural programs.niosh organizes its research program under the framework of the national occupational research agenda (nora). nora is a partnership program to stimulate innovative research and improved workplace practices. unveiled in 1996, nora is now entering its third decade (2016–2026) with an enhanced structure. it now consists of ten industry sectors based on major areas of the u.s. economy, and seven health and safety cross-sectors organized according to the major health and safety issues affecting the u.s. working population.niosh has developed a strategic plan for research for fiscal years 2019-2023 that identifies strategic and intermediate goals for its research portfolio (https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/about/strategicplan/). the strategic goals listed below represent the major health and safety issues facing the u.s workforce. these goals are the broad focus areas for this funding opportunity.strategic goalsintermediate goalsniosh has also identified intermediate goals. these are specific actions needed to achieve, or help achieve, the strategic goals. in addition, niosh has identified certain areas where extramural research is specifically encouraged to fill a gap or provide a capacity that niosh cannot. descriptions and updates of the strategic and intermediate goals are on the niosh website at https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/about/default.html.note to applicantsconsider the niosh strategic plan carefully as you develop proposals and identify the strategic and intermediate goals the proposed research will support. funding priority will be given to those applications that clearly address strategic and intermediate goals.researchers are encouraged to use innovative or novel approaches as they develop their research proposal to address the major health and safety issues facing the u.s. workforce and move the field forward through action designed to achieve these strategic and intermediate goals.nora sectors and health and safety cross-sectorsin the project description/abstract, state which industry sector(s) and health and safety cross-sector(s) the proposed work will address. provide a clear rationale for how the intended outcomes of the proposed project will contribute to the specified strategic and intermediate goals.funding priority will be given to applications that clearly identify the strategic and intermediate goals their proposed work will address or support.note to applicantsreview the following websites for updates about niosh strategic and intermediate goals, research goal priorities, and other current information as you craft and submit your research proposals:this information is provided to help researchers submit relevant, high-quality applications.the third decade of nora encompasses a new framework for assessing research priorities and aligning niosh research investments. this new framework provides a structured, transparent, evidence-based approach that considers the following:this new burden-need-impact framework is known by its acronym, bni. research funded under this foa will advance the strategic and intermediate goals of the niosh strategic plan based on bni. the concepts of the new bni framework are as follows:burden is risk from any of the following: exposure to hazards; occurrence of injuries, illnesses, or deaths due to work-related factors; and impacts on economic factors and well-being. the extent of exposure can be in terms of the number of workers exposed, the magnitude of the exposure, or both. the assessment of burden is based on several main constructs: magnitude of the problem; health impact severity; exposure to workers; societal costs; new or emerging issues; and relationship to work environment. for emerging issues, the burden is anticipatory.note to applicantsaddress the following elements of burden:although burden is a foundational factor in setting priorities, need is also a critical factor. niosh strives not only invest in an important burden area but also to focus on the most relevant and impactful issues pertaining to that burden.note to applicantsaddress the following elements of need:the assessment of impact is based on the potential for the activity to be successful in generating knowledge or products that will be used by stakeholders external to niosh (intermediate outcomes).note to applicantsdescribe how these intermediate outcomes might result in reduced burden or improved health and well-being in the near- or long-term. describe who will benefit from the proposed activities. include appropriate partners or stakeholders in the activities to help ensure successful transfer of the findings to the end users or intended audience.address the following elements of impact:niosh has a number of data resources are available to researchers at the niosh data and statistics gateway (https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/data/default.html). this includes worker health charts (https://wwwn.cdc.gov/niosh-whc) that use worker health data gathered by niosh from the bureau of labor statistics to create specialized charts to assess the rates, distribution, and trends in workplace injuries, illnesses and deaths. these data can be used to help provide the context and estimate the burden of the problems being addressed, the need for the proposed work, the impact on the workforce, and the potential long-term benefits of the proposed projects and activities. additionally, issues can be contextualized through economic metrics such as the societal cost, medical cost, productivity losses and disability costs.in addition to nora, niosh has established a research to practice (r2p) approach to reduce or eliminate occupational illness and injury. this r2p approach increases the transfer and translation of knowledge, interventions, and technologies into highly effective prevention practices and products into the workplace. it involves collaborations with partners and stakeholders on the use, adoption, andadaptation of niosh knowledge, interventions, and technologies that will move research into practice in order to reduce and eliminate injuries, illness, and fatalities. the r2p approach is an interactive process in which the occupational safety and health community—including researchers, communicators, decision-makers, and employer/employee groups—works collaboratively to:note to applicantsin both the description (abstract) and the research strategy (significance) section of your application, briefly state how the proposed research addresses r2p.proposed goals and objectives should be clearly stated in the application and directly linked to the occupational health and safety burdens being addressed. applicants are expected to justify their proposal by describing the burden of the problem, the need for the proposed research or activity, and the potential for impact or likelihood of success.provide data to support your selection of the proposed work, such as morbidity or mortality rates and indicators of the size of the population at risk (including estimates of the target population’s potential risk of exposure to the hazard, frequency of exposure, or sociodemographic factors such as age, gender, and race/ethnicity). similarly, provide qualitative data that describe exposures, the magnitude of the problem, and potential benefits and impacts of addressing the issue. qualitative data may be necessary when the nature of the exposure or population at risk makes it difficult to collect large-scale, representative quantitative data.governmental agencies and organizations have been faced with increasing demand to measure the effectiveness of their funded research in improving public health. effectiveness can be measured by the products (outputs) of research activities and subsequent outcomes, that is, benefits or changes at an individual or population level. outputs are the immediate products or direct result of research activities. examples include publications, reports, conference proceedings, presentations/posters, investigator career development, databases, tools, methods, guidelines, recommendations, and education and training materials.the causes of work-related injuries and illnesses are complex, and determining the effect that specific research activities have on them can take years. thus, outcomes can be measured over time as either intermediate or end outcomes.intermediate outcomes are specific changes that occur as a result of research activities. examples of intermediate outcomes include public or private policy changes, conduct of training or workshops based on project outputs, citations in the literature, inventions and patents, and adoption of technologies or methods developed by the researcher.end outcomes are the ultimate goal of the research and the result of what individuals or institutions do with the knowledge or products generated by the research. examples of end outcomes include reduction in workplace illnesses, injuries, fatalities, and/or hazardous exposures.note to applicantsin the description (abstract) and research strategy (significance) sections of your application, provide a brief statement about expected outputs and outcomes of your proposed research.the ultimate beneficiaries are workers in the united states. as an example, a project might target vulnerable u.s. worker populations to address increased safety and health risks associated with occupational health disparities, changing worker demographics, and the changing nature of work. the population(s) of workers to be addressed by the proposed research should be identified, whether specifically or more broadly.partnerships are critical for translating research findings into effective work practices and are encouraged by the niosh research-to-practice (r2p) program. interdisciplinary and trans-disciplinary collaborations that share expertise are essential to advancing occupational safety and health (osh).note to applicantsaddress a wide range of occupational safety and health concerns, as determined by the burdens posed by these concerns, and describe how your efforts will alleviate or eliminate these burdens. include collaborations or partnerships that strengthen the proposed research in terms of osh, or related, expertise and resources.evaluations provide information for management and improve program effectiveness. the following cdc document a framework for program evaluation may be helpful.effective program evaluation is a systematic way to improve and account for public health actions by involving procedures that are useful, feasible, ethical, and accurate. understanding and applying the elements of this framework for research projects may enhance planning effective public health strategies, improving existing programs including evidence-based activities, and demonstrating beneficial results and impact of federal funding.grant: a support mechanism providing money, property, or both to an eligible entity to carry out an

application guide to be eligible to apply for or receive an award. all registrations must be completed prior to the application being submitted. registration can take 6 weeks or more, so applicants should begin the registration process as soon as possible. the nih policy on late submission of grant applications states that failure to complete registrations in advance of a due date is not a valid reason for a late submission.program directors/principal investigators (pd(s)/pi(s))all pd(s)/pi(s) must have an era commons account. pd(s)/pi(s) should work with their organizational officials to either create a new account or to affiliate their existing account with the applicant organization in era commons. if the pd/pi is also the organizational signing official, they must have two distinct era commons accounts, one for each role. obtaining an era commons account can take up to 2 weeks.any candidate with the skills, knowledge, and resources necessary to carry out the proposed research as the pd/pi is invited to work with his/her mentor and organization to develop an application for support. individuals from underrepresented racial and ethnic groups as well as individuals with disabilities are always encouraged to apply for cdc support. multiple pds/pis are not allowed.applicants must have a research or health-professional doctoral or medical degree.applicants may have only one individual career development award application pending peer review at any time. awards are not renewable and are not transferable from one pd/pi to another.a candidate for a niosh k01 award may not simultaneously submit or have under review an application for any other phs award that duplicates or highly overlaps with the provisions of the niosh k01 award. current principal investigators on cdc/niosh or nih awards are not eligible.applicants for the k01, under some circumstances, may have been principal investigators on cdc/niosh or nih research or career development awards and are still eligible for this award, provided the research experience proposed in the k01 application is in a fundamentally new field of study. applicants are therefore strongly encouraged to contact the niosh scientific/research contact listed in section vii prior to preparing an application, to discuss issues of eligibility, program relevance, and specific provisions of this award.at the time of award, the candidate must have a full-time appointment at the applicant institution. niosh does not require applicants to be on a tenure track for k01 eligibility. candidates may not consider veterans affairs (va) appointments in satisfying the full-time status requirement at the applicant institution. candidates with va appointments should contact the niosh scientific/research contact listed in section vii prior to preparing an application to discuss their eligibility.by the time of award, the individual must be a citizen or a non-citizen national of the united states or have been lawfully admitted for permanent residence (that is, possess a currently valid permanent resident card [uscis form i-551], or other legal verification of such status).k01 award recipients are encouraged to obtain funding from cdc, niosh, nih, or other federal sources either as a named pd/pi on a competing research grant award or cooperative agreement or as a sub-project director on a competing multi-project award. at the time the research grant is awarded, the effort required on the k01 award may be reduced to no less than 6 person-months (50% full-time professional effort) at the grantee organization and replaced by effort from the other research award so that the total level of research commitment remains at 9 person-months (75% full-time professional effort) or more for the duration of the k01 award. see not-od-08-065 and not-od-09-036 for more details.for a k01 awardee to be eligible for salary support from other peer-reviewed research awards from any federal agency:this foa does not require cost sharing as defined in the hhs grants policy statement (http://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/grants/grants/policies-regulations/hhsgps107.pdf).applicant organizations may submit more than one application, provided that each application is scientifically distinct, and each is from a different candidate.at the time of award, the candidate must have a “full-time” appointment at the academic institution. candidates are required to commit a minimum of 75% of full-time professional effort (i.e., a minimum of 9 person-months) to their program of career development during the project period. candidates may engage in other duties as part of the remaining 25% of their full-time professional effort not covered by this award, as long as such duties do not interfere with or detract from the proposed career development program.candidates who have veteran affairs appointments may not consider part of the va effort toward satisfying the full time requirement at the applicant institution. candidates with va appointments should contact the staff person in the relevant institute or center prior to preparing an application to discuss their eligibility. under certain circumstances, an awardee may submit a written request to cdc/niosh seeking a reduction in minimum required percent effort, which will be considered on a case-by-case basis. details on this policy are provided in not-od-09-036.before submitting the application, the candidate must identify a mentor who will supervise the proposed career development and research experience. the mentor should be an active investigator in the area of the proposed research and be committed both to the career development of the candidate and to the direct supervision of the candidate’s research. the mentor must document the availability of sufficient research support and facilities for high-quality research.candidates are encouraged to identify more than one mentor, i.e., a mentoring team (or advisory committee), if this is deemed advantageous for providing expert advice in all aspects of the research career development program. in such cases, one individual must be identified as the primary mentor who will coordinate the candidate’s research. the candidate must work with the mentor(s) in preparing the application.the mentor, or a member of the mentoring team, should have a successful track record of mentoring individuals at the candidate’s career stage. the mentor(s) or mentoring team must demonstrate appropriate expertise, experience, and ability to guide the applicant in the organization, management and implementation of the proposed research and clinical trial.applications that exceed the 3-year period of performance limit or the direct cost limit of $100,000 per year (including consortium f&a costs) will be considered non-responsive and will not be reviewed. in these cases, cdc/niosh will notify the applicant and request that the application be withdrawn.indirect costs are limited to 8%. the maximum budget for a 3-year period of performance is $324,000 (including consortium f&a costs). applications that exceed this limit will be considered non-responsive and

qualification or financial integrity information as appropriate. see also suspension and debarment requirements at 2 cfr parts 180 and 376.in accordance 41 u.s.c. 2313, cdc is required to review the non-public segment of theomb-designated integrity and performance system accessible through sam (currently the federal awardee performance and integrity information system (fapiis)) prior to making a federal award where the federal share is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold, defined in 41 u.s.c. 134, over the period of performance. at a minimum, the information in the system for a prior federal award recipient must demonstrate a satisfactory record of executing programs or activities under federal grants, cooperative agreements, or procurement awards; and integrity and business ethics. cdc may make a federal award to a recipient who does not fully meet these standards, if it is determined that the information is not relevant to the current federal award under consideration or there are specific conditions that can appropriately mitigate the effects of the non-federal entity's risk in accordance with 45 cfr §75.207.cdc’s framework for evaluating the risks posed by an applicant may incorporate results of the evaluation of the applicant's eligibility or the quality of its application. if it is determined that afederal award will be made, special conditions that correspond to the degree of risk assessed may be applied to the federal award. in evaluating risks posed by applicants, cdc will use a risk-based approach and may consider any items such as the following:cdc must comply with the guidelines on government-wide suspension and debarment in 2 cfr part 180, and require non-federal entities to comply with these provisions. these provisions restrict federal awards, subawards and contracts with certain parties that are debarred, suspended or otherwise excluded from or ineligible for participation in federal programs or
