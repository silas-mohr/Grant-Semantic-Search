section viii. other informationthe food and drug administration (fda) protects the public health by ensuring that pharmaceutical drug products intended to be marketed in the united states are safe and effective for their intended use. fda and its stakeholders are exploring innovative ways to produce scientific evidence in support of biosimilar and interchangeable product development. specifically, under the proposed commitments outlined in the third proposed biosimilar user fee act (bsufa) commitment letter, fda is exploring ways to enhance biosimilar and interchangeable product development and regulatory science, specifically in the areas of 1) improving the efficiency of biosimilar product development and 2) advancing the development of interchangeable products.1) improving the efficiency of biosimilar products development.the standards for biosimilarity are the candidate product must a) be highly similar to the reference product and b) have no clinically meaningful differences from the reference product.improving the efficiency of biosimilar development can include:a) scientific advancements in analytical (including physical, chemical and biological function), and pharmacological assessmentsi) improving the identification and risk assessment of relevant product, excipient, and container closure attributesii) better defining acceptable product quality attribute differencesiii) advancing analytical tools to detect relevant differences and use of statistical methodologies that are demonstrated to facilitate the comparative analytical assessment.b) scientifically appropriate methodologies to inform clinical trial design as it relates to biosimilarityi) predicting comparative immunogenicity assessment using in silico and in vitro methodologiesii) developing broadly applicable approaches for the use of pharmacodynamic markers that support biosimilar product developmentiii) advances in statistical methods to streamline clinical trial designas the determination of no clinically meaningful differences is dependent on the residual uncertainty from the analytical evaluation, advances in (a) can support efficiency in (b). for example, in silico, analytical tools or bioassays that better predict immunogenicity could streamline the clinical data needed to support no clinically meaningful differences in immunogenicity between a proposed biosimilar product and the reference product.2) advancing the development of interchangeable productsthe standards for interchangeability are that the proposed interchangeable product “can be expected to produce the same clinical result as the reference product in any given patient” and for biological products administered more than once to a patient, “the risk in terms of safety or diminished efficacy of alternating or switching between use of the biological product and the reference product is not greater than the risk of using the reference product without such alternation or switch.”a) advancing the development of interchangeable products would include:i) better defining differences or providing tools to evaluate differences in product container closure and any associated devicesii) developing alternative approaches than a switching study to meet the standard for interchangeable products administered more than once to a patient (e.g., real world evidence such as health data from medical claims, electronic health records, data captured using digital tools, data from registries, and other sources, in vitro and in silico methods that predict immunogenicity risk associated with switching)for additional information about efforts related to biosimilar user fee act (bsufa) research funding and the bsufa iii regulatory science pilot program, see the bsufa science and research page.the purpose of this funding opportunity announcement (foa) is to address a diversity of topics related to improving the efficiency of biosimilar product development and advancing the development of interchangeable products. the scope of submitted projects should aim to focus on the following:1) increasing the accuracy and capability of analytical characterizations (including physical, chemical and biological function) and chemistry, manufacturing, and controls (cmc)2) developing alternatives to and/ or reducing the size of studies involving human subjectsadditionally, of particular interest are projects related to the following:a) identifying which injection device parameters can influence pk (e.g., injection time, viscosity, needle length, needle gauge, forces applied to the plunger, spring force, needle extended length, injection volume, and flow rate) and defining the range by which these parameters can deviate before a clinical pk bridging study would be needed to confirm pk comparability. the goal of the studies for a) is use of analytical device information, without any clinical pk bridging, to determine if design differences in the delivery device or container closure system within a 351(k) development program are acceptable. of note, this assessment would be for the need for additional pk bridging based on device parameters which is separate from the request for a pk similarity to establish biosimilarity.b) conduct studies to determine whether user interface differences for interchangeable products can lead to differences in use errors rates or use success rates during use of a product when a user is switched from a first medical product that they have experience using to a second medical product and vice versa. some potential differences include, but are not limited to:prefilled pen - presence of an extending dose barrel vs. no extending dose barrel when dialing doseautoinjector – presence of a button to activate an injection vs no button to activate an injectionprefilled syringe – no needle safety guard on a proposed product vs. needle safety guard on a reference productthe goal of these studies for b) is to identify user interface differences that will or will not lead to statistically significant differences in use error rates or use success rates.c) in circumstances where it is unknown whether user interface differences for interchangeable products can lead to differences in use error rates or use success rates, study the effectiveness of the currently proposed comparative use human factors (cuhf) study approach in the fda draft guidance ‘comparative analyses and related comparative use human factors studies for a drug-device combination product submitted in an anda’ or develop new methods and/or principles to evaluate whether the user interface differences can lead to differences in use error rates or use success rates, including identifying a scientifically justifiable range by which differences in use error rates or use success rates would not preclude a determination of interchangeability.the goal of these studies for c) is to either to study the effectiveness of the existing cuhf methodology in the fda draft guidance ‘comparative analyses and related comparative use human factors studies for a drug-device combination product submitted in an anda’ in evaluating whether user interface differences can lead to differences in use error rates or use success rates for proposed interchangeable or to develop methods and/or principles to help determine acceptable differences in use error rates or use success rates that would not impact safe and effective use of the interchangeable product as compared to a reference product.of note for all project submitted,see section

in compliance with federal civil rights laws that prohibit discrimination on the basis of race, color, national origin, disability, age and, in some circumstances, religion, conscience, and sex (including gender identify, sexual orientation, and pregnancy). this includes ensuring programs are accessible to persons with limited english proficiency and persons with disabilities. the hhs office for civil rights provides guidance on complying with civil rights laws enforced by hhs. please see https://www.hhs.gov/civil-rights/for-providers/provider-obligations/index.html and https://www.hhs.gov/civil-rights/for-individuals/nondiscrimination/index.htmlhhs recognizes that research projects are often limited in scope for many reasons that are nondiscriminatory, such as the principal investigator’s scientific interest, funding limitations, recruitment requirements, and other considerations. thus, criteria in research protocols that target or exclude certain populations are warranted where nondiscriminatory justifications establish that such criteria are appropriate with respect to the health or safety of the subjects, the scientific study design, or the purpose of the research. for additional guidance regarding how the provisions apply to fda grant programs, please contact the scientific/research contact that is identified in section vii under agency contacts
