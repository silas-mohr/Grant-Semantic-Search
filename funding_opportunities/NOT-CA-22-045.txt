however, proposed studies should address the potential for intervention sustainability and scalability. research studies that integrate expertise from diverse scientific and clinical areas (e.g., health services, health economics, outcomes research, health communications, social work, pharmacy, nursing, and oncology) are of particular interest. studies that target populations identified to be at risk for health disparities are strongly encouraged.areas of research interest include, but are not limited to:application and submission informationthis notice applies to due dates on or after april 1, 2022 and subsequent receipt dates through march 1, 2024.submit applications for this initiative using one of the following funding opportunity announcements (foas) or any reissues of these announcements through the expiration date of this notice.activity codefoa titlefirst available due datepar-21-190: modular r01s in cancer control and population sciences (r01 clinical trial optional)all instructions in the sf424 (r&r) application guide and the funding opportunity announcement used for submission must be followed, with the following additions:for funding consideration, applicants must include “not-ca-22-045” (without quotation marks) in the agency routing identifier field (box 4b) of the sf424 r&r form. applications without this information in box 4b will not be considered for this initiative.although nci is not listed as a participating organization in all the foas listed above, applications for this initiative will be accepted.applications nonresponsive to terms of this nosi will be withdrawn from consideration for this initiative.scientific/research contact(s)kathleen castro, rn, ms, aocn national cancer institute (nci) telephone: 240-276-6834 email: kathleen.castro@mail.nih.govpeer review contact(s)examine your era commons account for review assignment and contact information (information appears two weeks after the submission due date).financial/grants management contact(s)dawn mitchum national cancer institute (nci) telephone: 240-276-6282 email: dm437a@nih.govweekly toc for this announcement nih funding opportunities and noticesnote: for help accessing pdf, rtf, ms word, excel, powerpoint, audio or video files, see help downloading files.
