iv. application and submission information section v. application review information section vi. award administration information section vii. agency contacts section viii. other informationcommercial fishing is one of the most dangerous occupations in the united states and puts workers at high risk for severe injuries, illnesses, and death. the industry is comprised of a diverse population of vessels and associated gear used to catch seafood. many commercial fishing operations are characterized by hazardous working conditions, strenuous labor, long work hours, and harsh weather conditions (niosh, commercial fishing safety national overview). during 2000-2015, an annual average of 42 deaths occurred in the industry (117 deaths per 100,000 workers), compared with an average of 5,247 deaths (4 deaths per 100,000 workers) among all u.s. workers (us department of labor statistics).data from the national institute for occupational safety and health (niosh) commercial fishing incident database (cfid) show that from 2000-2015:· 725 commercial fishermen died while fishing in the u.s.· nearly half of all fatalities (354, 49%) occurred after a vessel disaster· another 221 (30%) fatalities were due to falls overboard· another 87 (12%) fatalities resulted from an injury onboard· the remaining 63 (9%) fatalities occurred while diving or from onshore injuriesniosh has looked at some of these types of events more carefully to identify risk factors. for instance, from 2000-2016, none of the victims in fatal falls overboard were wearing a personal flotation device (pfd) when they drowned. in addition, 59% of the falls were unwitnessed, and alcohol and drugs contributed to over 18% of all fatalities (case et al, 2018). this study also found that fatalities associated with unintentional falls overboard occurred most frequently on the east coast (30%), followed by the gulf of mexico (29%), alaska (25%), and the west coast (13%). five deaths occurred off the hawaiian coast.the leading causes of fatal vessel disasters vary from region to region. during 2010-2014, the west coast had the highest percentage of fatalities due to vessel disasters (60%), and many of these incidents were due to crossing dangerous river bars. in comparison, vessel disasters accounted for 33% of fatalities in alaska, with most victims working in small, undecked skiffs. vessels operating in alaska also have an increased risk of icing, which can lead to vessel instability and subsequent capsizing. in the gulf of mexico, fatal vessel collisions were more prevalent than in other regions. vessel disasters and falls overboard resulted in the same number of fatalities (37%) on the east coast, and three of the most high-risk fisheries in the country are in this region.despite some recent successes in reducing fatal work-related injuries within the commercial fishing industry, the need for safety training and intervention activities remains essential. training in emergency drills, survival, damage control, fire prevention and firefighting, stability, seamanship, fatigue awareness and prevention, watchkeeping and weather forecasting is needed to reduce occupational safety risk in the us fishing industry. having trained crew and operators that know how to prevent and appropriately respond to at-sea emergencies can mean the difference between life and death, particularly in remote, offshore locations where assistance may be delayed.the commercial fishing occupational safety training grant was established by the coast guard authorization act of 2010 (p.l. 111-281), as amended by the howard coble coast guard and maritime transportation act of 2014 (p.l. 113-281), and is intended to provide funding to municipalities, port authorities, other appropriate public entities, not-for-profit organizations, and other qualified persons to conduct commercial fishing vessel safety training for vessel operators and crewmembers. safety training courses could include the following topics: emergency drills, survival, damage control, fire prevention and firefighting, stability, seamanship, fatigue awareness and prevention, watchkeeping, and weather forecasting. the program is also authorized to provide funding for the purchase of safety equipment and training aids for use in those safety training programs.the goal of the training grant program is to enhance the quality and availability of safety training for united states commercial fishermen. availability includes the frequency, geographic considerations, channels, or partners of dissemination, culturally and/or educational appropriate training material, and other characteristics of a successful training program. as a result, the coast guard and niosh invite applications to support the development and implementation of training and education programs that meet some (or all) of the following:· develop and deliver training which addresses the needs of commercial fishermen in the united states· increase the number of qualified marine safety instructors to conduct these types of training· evaluate the effectiveness and impact of the training program on reducing injuries among commercial fishermen· coordinate with existing training programs and partnerships with industry, fishermen, and agencies· conform to 46 u.s.c. § 4502 (i) safety standards for commercial fishing safety trainingin order to support and administer the grant program, the coast guard and niosh signed a memorandum of understanding on may 17, 2018. while the coast guard, along with the occupational safety and health administration (osha), provides regulatory oversight for safety and health matters within the commercial fishing industry, niosh is an agency operating under the centers for disease control and prevention (cdc) with the mission of generating new knowledge in occupational safety and health and transferring that knowledge into practice to prevent worker injury, illness, and death. niosh conducts and funds scientific research, develops methods to prevent occupational hazards, develops guidance and authoritative recommendations, translates scientific knowledge into products and services, disseminates information, identifies factors underlying work-related disease and injury, and responds to requests for workplace health hazard evaluations.healthy people 2030 and other national strategic prioritiesthe united states public health service (phs) is committed to achieving a society in which all people live long, healthy lives. the vision, mission, and goals of phs are found in healthy people 2030, a phs-led national activity to achieve better health in the united states by the year 2030. this funding announcement is linked to the goals of healthy people 2030, that are intended to prevent work-related diseases, injuries, and deaths while improving worker health, safety, and well-being.according to the healthy people 2030, more than 160 million people participate in the u.s. labor force, and their work has an intrinsic connection to their safety and health. decades of public health surveillance and research have demonstrated that work-related injuries adversely affect employers, workers, and communities. workplace settings vary widely in size, sector, design, location, processes, culture, and resources. in addition, workers themselves have different ages, genders, education levels, cultural backgrounds, health practices, and levels of access to preventive health care. this translates into great diversity and disparity in the safety and health risks for each industry sector and the need for tailored interventions.the healthy people 2030 occupational safety and health objectives aim to prevent illness, injury, and disease due to working conditions. all objectives, core and developmental, align with niosh’s strategic plan and are addressed through the national occupational research agenda (nora). nora is a program established by niosh that works with partners from academia, industry, labor, and government to stimulate research and improve workplace practices.public health impactniosh office of extramural programs supports national occupational safety and health research and training programs to reduce work-related injuries and illnesses. commercial fishing is one of the most dangerous occupations in the united states, and the need for targeted safety research and training is critical. through this funding opportunity announcement, niosh encourages qualified applicants to submit applications that will reduce or prevent occupational illness, injury, and death among workers in the commercial fishing industry.relevant workthe commercial fishing occupational safety training project grants program was established by the coast guard authorization act of 2010 (p.l. 111-281), as amended by the howard coble coast guard and maritime transportation act of 2014 (p.l. 113-281), to support training to improve the occupational safety of workers in the commercial fishing industry. commercial fishing is one of the most hazardous occupations in the united states with a fatality rate 29 times higher than the national average. niosh has conducted studies of fishing safety to reduce the incidence of injuries and fatalities among the nation’s fishermen. niosh studies show that the greatest dangers to fishermen are vessel disasters, falls overboard, and machinery on deck.niosh has an extensive history of conducting research to understand and to reduce hazards in the commercial fishing industry. this research has largely been conducted in close collaboration with crews, industry, and the us coast guard. to learn more about niosh's work in commercial fishing safety and health, visit niosh's commercial fishing safety webpage.the commercial fishing occupational safety training grant program is intended to improve availability and quality of commercial fishing training across the united states and especially in underserved geographic regions and/or high-risk fisheries. moreover, it provides an opportunity to address gaps in current training materials, particularly those related to the unique needs of specific regions/fleets.an immediate goal of safety and health training for commercial fishermen is to provide them with relevant knowledge regarding hazards encountered in the maritime environment, personal protective equipment for protection of health and safety, along with practical tools for reducing risks for injuries and illness. primary prevention of injuries among commercial fishermen depends to a great extent on proper use and maintenance of vessels and engineering controls. training programs should include these topics as part of an integrated approach. the training program should assist commercial fishermen in becoming active participants in determining and improving the safety conditions under which they work and in establishing collaborative employer-employee relationships for creating safe workplaces.applicants should justify the choice of location in terms of need, potential impact (for example, the number of commercial fishermen trained, changes in competencies/behavior relevant to health and safety improvements, and reductions in incidents), as well as accessibility, feasibility, and cost. ideally, training should be hands-on and occur in fishing communities on or near the water. applicants should also provide information on the frequency of the training, along with characteristics of the commercial fishermen cohort, if known (target and/or vulnerable workforce). the application must clearly identify the professional and experiential credentials of those performing the training.niosh organizes its research program under the framework of the national occupational research agenda (nora). nora is a partnership program to stimulate innovative research and improved workplace practices. based on a collaborative effort from sector council members, the most recent nora agenda prioritizes the knowledge and actions most urgently needed to identify occupational risk factors to prevent adverse health outcomes among workers. the agenda also provides a vehicle for stakeholders to describe the most relevant safety and health issues, research gaps, and needs. occupational safety and health objectives for the commercial fishing industry fall within the scope of the nora agriculture, forestry, and fishing sector council.this training grant program specifically supports the following agriculture, forestry, and fishing nora objectives:fi-01: reduce the risk of fatal and non-fatal injuries in the commercial fishing sub-sector. fi-02: reduce the risk of work-related illness to workers in the commercial fishing sub-sector. fi-03: increase safety and health data meshing, information sharing, and collaboration among fishing safety researchers for workers in the fishing sub-sector. fi-04: reduce injuries and illness in the vulnerable worker populations in the fishing sub-sector.note to applicants: consider the purpose and intent of the commercial fishing occupational safety and training program as described in the coast guard authorization act of 2010 and the nora agriculture, forestry, and fishing objectives as you develop proposals. clearly identify the objectives that the proposed training grant will support. funding priority will be given to those applications that clearly address the purpose and intent of the training program and the nora objectives. applicants are encouraged to propose innovative or novel training approaches that address critical commercial fishing safety issues and improve the delivery and effectiveness of the training provided.objectives/outcomesproposed goals and objectives should be clearly stated in the application and directly linked to the occupational health and safety burdens being addressed. applicants are expected to justify their proposal by describing the burden of the problem, the need for the proposed training, and the potential for impact or likelihood of success.applicants should provide data to support their selection of proposed training, such as fatalities or fatality rates, indicators of the size of the population at risk including estimates of the target population's potential risk of exposure to the hazard, frequency of exposure, or sociodemographic factors such as age, gender, and race/ethnicity. similarly, applicants may provide qualitative data that describe exposures, the magnitude of the problem, and potential benefits and impacts of addressing the issue. qualitative data, such as case studies, may be necessary when the nature of the exposure or population at risk make finding large-scale, representative quantitative data difficult.the objectives of the proposed commercial fishing safety training grant program include:· addressing the training needs of commercial fishermen, with regional differences and specific fleets in mind· increasing the number of qualified marine safety instructors and drill conductors in the united states to conduct these types of training· developing, offering and implementing "train the trainer" and refresher courses· developing and delivering hands on safety training to commercial fishermen· providing qualified instructors and faculty to achieve the goals of this programpotential outcomes of proposed training projects should show changes in the following:· safety-relevant behavior· operational practices that reduce commercial fishermen risks and reduce incidents· frequency and severity of injuries· productivity and effectiveness of training and other indicators of performance· coordination with other existing marine safety training programstarget populationthe beneficiaries of the proposed training projects are workers in the u.s. commercial fishing industry.diversity, equity, and inclusionin june 2019, niosh began an initiative to take substantive action in creating greater diversity, equity, and inclusion in its workforce, the workplace and in its service to the public. this initiative led to the establishment of the niosh diversity and inclusion office. the associated strategic plan is intended to guide actions that specifically address diversity, equity, and inclusion (dei) in all aspects of niosh's work, including niosh-supported extramural programs. applicants should demonstrate a commitment to dei in all aspects of their proposed training project.asymmetrical power relationships along social axes such as age, class, gender, nativity, and race/ethnicity not only result in social, economic, and environmental disadvantages that impact the distribution of work-related benefits and risks, but also result in exclusionary research practices.developing inclusive research practices, and the institutional capacity to effectively produce data driven solutions that reduce these avoidable inequities, is essential to ensuring the well-being of the increasingly diverse workforce. applicants should identify how research questions, data collection methods and analysis, and dissemination of results will be inclusive of the diversity in the commercial fishing workforce, especially those from historically underrepresented groups. applicants should also demonstrate how the design, content, format, and dissemination of outreach efforts will be tailored to the needs of workers from diverse backgrounds.collaboration/partnershipspartnerships are integral to the commercial fishing occupational safety training project grants program. they facilitate advances in the safety and health of u.s. commercial fishing workers. input from industry and stakeholder groups, which have inherent knowledge and concern about the safety of fishermen, will enhance training projects. partners often add expertise or specialized experience to the training project team, which contributes to the success of the overall project.applicants should institute collaborative partnerships. these can be with commercial fishing organizations, local and state organizations, universities, manufacturers, government agencies, other professional organizations, engineering and safety training partner organizations, community organizations, healthcare institutions, business groups, and labor organizations to carry out these proposed training activities.partnerships are also critical to translate findings into effective training and work practices that are encouraged by the niosh research-to-practice program (r2p). interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary collaborations that share expertise are essential to advancing occupational safety and promoting overall worker safety in commercial fishing environments.note to applicants:include collaborations or partnerships that strengthen the proposed training in terms of osh, or related, expertise and resources.evaluation/performance measurementan evaluation plan that addresses the impact of training on the safety of commercial fishermen must be included in the application. the plan should clearly describe how training quality, effectiveness, and impact (short-term and long-term) will be evaluated.evaluations provide information for management to improve program effectiveness. the cdc document a framework for program evaluation can be helpful.effective program evaluation is a systematic way to improve and account for public health actions by involving procedures that are useful, feasible, ethical, and accurate. understanding and applying the elements of this framework for training projects may enhance planning effective public health strategies, improving existing programs, including evidence-based activities, and demonstrating beneficial results and impact of federal funding.translation planin addition to nora, niosh has established a research-to-practice (r2p) approach to reduce or eliminate occupational illness and injury by increasing the transfer and translation of knowledge, interventions, and technologies into highly effective prevention practices and products into the workplace.r2p is an approach to collaborations with partners and stakeholders on the use, adoption, and adaptation of niosh knowledge, interventions, and technologies that will move research into practice in order to reduce and eliminate injuries, illness, and fatalities.the r2p approach is an interactive process in which the occupational safety and health community, including researchers, communicators, decision-makers, and employer/employee groups, works collaboratively to:· identify research needs· design, plan, and conduct studies· translate and disseminate existing knowledge, interventions, and technologies to relevant users for implementation in the workplace· evaluate results to determine the impact on occupational safety and healthnote to applicants:applicants must provide a brief statement about how their proposed training project addresses r2p in both the description (abstract) and in the training project strategy (significance) sections of the application. describe the anticipated strategies for translation and dissemination of research findings, including by audience segmentation and by the characteristics of the channels or modes of dissemination. a logic model that describes the inputs, activities, outputs, intermediate outcomes, and expected long-term outcomes may be included. the cdc document applying the knowledge to action (k2a) framework is a useful resource.see section viii. other information for award authorities and regulations.grant: a support mechanism providing money, property, or both to an eligible entity to carry out an approved

requirement applies to participating sites in the united states. foreign sites participating in cdc-funded, cooperative research studies are not expected to follow the requirement for sirb.risk assessment questionnaire requirementcdc is required to conduct pre-award risk assessments to determine the risk an applicant poses to meeting federal programmatic and administrative requirements by taking into account issues such as financial instability, insufficient management systems, non-compliance with award conditions, the charging of unallowable costs, and inexperience. the risk assessment will include an evaluation of the applicant’s cdc risk questionnaire, located at https://www.cdc.gov/grants/documents/ppmr-g-cdc-risk-questionnaire.pdf, as well as a review of the applicant’s history in all available systems; including omb-designated repositories of government-wide eligibility and financial integrity systems (see 45 cfr 75.205(a)), and other sources of historical information. these systems include, but are not limited to: fapiis (https://www.fapiis.gov/), including past performance on federal contracts as per duncan hunter national defense authorization act of 2009; do not pay list; and system for award management (sam) exclusions.cdc requires all applicants to complete the risk questionnaire, omb control number 0920-1132 annually. this questionnaire, which is located at https://www.cdc.gov/grants/documents/ppmr-g-cdc-risk-questionnaire.pdf, along with supporting documentation must be submitted with your application by the closing date of the notice of funding opportunity announcement. if your organization has completed cdc’s risk questionnaire within the past 12 months of the closing date of this nofo, then you must submit a copy of that questionnaire, or submit a letter signed by the authorized organization representative to include the original submission date, organization’s ein and uei.when uploading supporting documentation for the risk questionnaire into this application package, clearly label the documents for easy identification of the type of documentation. for example, a copy of procurement policy submitted in response to the questionnaire may be labeled using the following format: risk questionnaire supporting documents _ procurement policy.duplication of efforts applicants are responsible for reporting if this application will result in programmatic, budgetary, or commitment overlap with another application or award (i.e., grant, cooperative agreement, or contract) submitted to another funding source in the same fiscal year. programmatic overlap occurs when (1) substantially the same project is proposed in more than one application or is submitted to two or more funding sources for review and funding consideration or (2) a specific objective and the project design for accomplishing the objective are the same or closely related in two or more applications or awards, regardless of the funding source. budgetary overlap occurs when duplicate or equivalent budgetary items (e.g., equipment, salaries) are requested in an application but already are provided by another source. commitment overlap occurs when an individual’s time commitment exceeds 100 percent, whether or not salary support is requested in the application. overlap, whether programmatic, budgetary, or commitment of an individual’s effort greater than 100 percent, is not permitted. any overlap will be resolved by the cdc with the applicant and the pd/pi prior to award.report submission: the applicant must upload the report under "other attachment forms." the document should be labeled: "report on programmatic, budgetary, and commitment overlap."cost match requirementa 25% cost match is required for this nofo. clearly indicate how the non-federal 25% cost match requirement will be met. a letter of commitment should be included in the application to indicate the amount and the source of the cost match. matching is generally calculated on the basis of the federal award amount and is comprised of recipient contributions proposed to support anticipated costs of the project during a specific budget period (confirmation of the existence of funding is supplied by the recipient via their federal financial report). the recipient must be able to account separately for stewardship of the federal funding and for any required matching; it is subject to monitoring, oversight, and audit. the recipient may not use matching expenditures to count toward any maintaining state funding requirement.matching sources: the following sources can be used for the 25% cost match: program income, subrecipient costs, in-kind support, and indirect costs. the use of other federal funds for matching is not allowed. the matching percentage is non-negotiable and is calculated as a percentage of the total proposed cost.application submissionapplications must be submitted electronically following the instructions described in the sf 424 (r&r) application guide. paper applications will not be accepted.applicants must complete all required registrations before the application due date. section iii.1 "required registrations" contains information about registration.for assistance with your electronic application or for more information on the electronic submission process, visit

their era commons id in the credential field of the senior/key person profile component of the sf 424(r&r) application package. failure to register in the commons and to include a valid pd/pi commons id in the credential field will prevent the successful submission of an electronic application to cdc.it is also important to note that for multi-project applications, this requirement also applies to the individual components of the application and not to just the overall component.the applicant organization must ensure that the uei number provided on the application is the same number used in the organization’s profile in the era commons and for the system for award management (sam). additional information may be found in the sf424 (r&r) application guide.note: applicants must have a unique entity identifier (uei) at the time of application submission. the uei is generated as part of sam.gov registration. current sam.gov registrants have already been assigned their uei and can view it in sam.gov and grants.gov. additional information is available on the gsa website, sam.gov,and grants.gov-finding the uei.if the applicant has an fwa number, enter the 8-digit number. do not enter the letters “fwa” before the number. if a project/performance site is engaged in research involving human subjects, the applicant organization is responsible for ensuring that the project/performance site operates under and appropriate federal wide assurance for the protection of human subjects and complies with 45 cfr part 46 and other cdc human subject related policies described in part ii of the sf 424 (r&r) application guide and in the hhs grants policy statement.see more resources to avoid common errors and submitting, tracking, and viewing applications:·

www.cdc.gov/ about/ organization/ mission.htm), all applications submitted to the cdc in support of public health are evaluated for scientific and technical merit through the cdc peer review system.reviewers will provide an overall impact score to reflect their assessment of the likelihood for the project to exert a sustained, powerful influence on the occupational safety and health field involved, in consideration of the following review criteria and additional review criteria (as applicable for the project proposed).reviewers will consider each of the review criteria below in the determination of scientific merit and give a separate score for each. an application does not need to be strong in all categories to be judged likely to have major scientific impact. for example, a project that by its nature is not innovative may be essential to advance a field.does the project address an important problem or a critical barrier to progress in the field? is the prior work that serves as the key support for the proposed project rigorous? if the aims of the project are achieved, how will scientific knowledge, technical capability, and/or clinical practice be improved? how will successful completion of the aims change the concepts, methods, technologies, treatments, services, or preventative interventions that drive this field?significance is evaluated by considering the impact the proposed training program has in meeting an identified regional or national need for occupational safety and health training. does the training program have the potential to successfully meet stated goals and objectives and impact the health and safety of the workforce through its training program? does the creation or continuation of the training program advance the field of occupational safety and health in the commercial fishing industry? does the training program’s past performance reflect a successful track record of osh training for commercial fishing vessel safety? is there evidence that this program integrates with and complements other niosh supported training programs?are the pd(s)/pi(s), collaborators, and other investigators well suited to the project? if early stage investigators or those in the early stages of independent careers, do they have appropriate experience and training? if established, have they demonstrated an ongoing record of accomplishments that have advanced their field(s)? if the project is collaborative or multi-pd/pi, do the investigators have complementary and integrated expertise; are their leadership approach, governance, and organizational structure appropriate for the project?does the program director for the proposed training program have experience in managing a high-quality commercial fishing vessel safety and health training program? do the key personnel identified have strong histories of providing this type of training to their target audience? are the key personnel accomplished practitioners or trainers, as evidenced by their biosketches and experiences?does the application challenge and seek to shift current practice paradigms by utilizing novel theoretical concepts, approaches or methodologies, instrumentation, or interventions? are the concepts, approaches or methodologies, instrumentation, or interventions novel to one area or novel in a broad sense? is a refinement, improvement, or new application of theoretical concepts, approaches or methodologies, instrumentation, or interventions proposed?does the proposed training program involve innovative approaches to achieving and maintaining highly effective commercial fishing vessel safety training? are there innovative approaches in recruiting underserved or underrepresented individuals?are the overall strategy, methodology, and analyses well-reasoned and appropriate to accomplish the specific aims of the project? are potential problems, alternative strategies, and benchmarks for success presented? if the project is in the early stages of development, will the strategy establish feasibility, and will particularly risky aspects be managed?is there an evaluation plan to determine the effectiveness of the training program? is there evidence of active participation by an advisory committee either internally or externally? is the training curriculum consistent with a high-quality us coast guard accepted training program in commercial fishing vessel safety? if applicable, what is the accreditation status of the training program? does the training program have a successful history of reaching its intended target audience? are there plans to obtain and incorporate feedback from stakeholders, including current and former trainees to changes to improve performance?will the training environment in which the work will be done contribute to the probability of success? are the institutional support, equipment, and other physical resources available to the investigators adequate for the project proposed? will the project benefit from unique features of the training environment, subject populations, or collaborative arrangements?will the training environment contribute to the probability of improving commercial fishing vessel safety? is there evidence of organizational or institutional commitment to support the goals of the training program? are the facilities and equipment adequate and appropriate to support the proposed training?as applicable for the project proposed, reviewers will evaluate the following additional items while determining scientific and technical merit, and in providing an overall impact score, but will not give separate scores for these items.for training projects that involves human subjects but does not involve one of the categories of research that are exempt under 45 cfr part 46, the committee will evaluate the justification for involvement of human subjects and the proposed protections from research risk relating to their participation according to the following five review criteria: 1) risk to subjects, 2) adequacy of protection against risks, 3) potential benefits to the subjects and others, 4) importance of the knowledge to be gained, and 5) data and safety monitoring for clinical trials.for training projects that involves human subjects and meets the criteria for one or more of the categories of

the appropriateness of the species proposed; (3) interventions to minimize discomfort, distress, pain and injury; and (4) justification for euthanasia method if not consistent with the avma guidelines for the euthanasia of animals. reviewers will assess the use of chimpanzees as they would any other application proposing the use of vertebrate animals. for additional information on review of the vertebrate animals section, please refer to the worksheet for review of the vertebrate animal section.reviewers will assess whether materials or procedures proposed are potentially hazardous to personnel and/or the environment, and if needed, determine whether adequate protection is proposed.dual research of concernreviewers will identify whether the project involves one of the agents or toxins described in the us government policy for the institutional oversight of life sciences dual use research of concern, and, if so, whether the applicant has identified an ire to assess the project for durc potential and develop mitigation strategies if needed.for more information about this policy and other policies regarding dual use research of concern, visit the u.s. government science, safety, security (s3) website at: http://www.phe.gov/s3/dualuse. tools and guidance for assessing durc potential may be found at: http://www.phe.gov/s3/dualuse/pages/companion-guide.aspx.for resubmissions, the committee will evaluate the application as now presented, taking into consideration the responses to comments from the previous scientific review group and changes made to the project.for renewals, the committee will consider the progress made in the last funding period. is there sufficient information provided describing how the research has achieved the goals of the previous funding period? is there sufficient information on how the goals for future years build on the previous successes? does the applicant describe and provide evidence of outcomes and impacts achieved?for revisions, the committee will consider the appropriateness of the proposed expansion of the scope of the project. if the revision application relates to a specific line of investigation presented in the original application that was not recommended for approval by the committee, then the committee will consider whether the responses to comments from the previous scientific review group are adequate and whether substantial changes are clearly evident.as applicable for the project proposed, reviewers will consider each of the following items, but will not give scores for these items, and should not consider them in providing an overall impact score.research to practicereviewers will assess if the applicant has demonstrated how their proposal addresses the research to

financial integrity information as appropriate. see also suspension and debarment requirements at 2 cfr parts 180 and 376.in accordance with 41 u.s.c. 2313, cdc is required to review the non-public segment of the omb-designated integrity and performance system accessible through sam (currently the federal recipient performance and integrity information system (fapiis)) prior to making a federal award where the federal share is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold, defined in 41 u.s.c. 134, over the period of performance. at a minimum, the information in the system for a prior federal award recipient must demonstrate a satisfactory record of executing programs or activities under federal grants, cooperative agreements, or procurement awards, and integrity and business ethics. cdc may make a federal award to a recipient who does not fully meet these standards if it is determined that the information is not relevant to the current federal award under consideration or there are specific conditions that can appropriately mitigate the effects of the non-federal entity's risk in accordance with 45 cfr §75.207.cdc’s framework for evaluating the risks posed by an applicant may incorporate results of the evaluation of the applicant's eligibility or the quality of its application. if it is determined that a federal award will be made, special conditions that correspond to the degree of risk assessed may be applied to the federal award. the evaluation criteria is described in this notice of funding opportunity.in evaluating risks posed by applicants, cdc will use a risk-based approach and may consider any items such as the following:· financial stability· quality of management systems and ability to meet the management standards prescribed in this part· history of performance. the applicant's record in managing federal awards, if it is a prior recipient of federal awards, including timeliness of compliance with applicable reporting requirements, conformance to the terms and conditions of previous federal awards, and if applicable, the extent to which any previously awarded amounts will be expended prior to future awards· reports
