elimination of metabolic waste by-products; and endocrine/hormone production.program contact: da-yu wu, ph.d., wudy@nida.nih.gov, 301-435-4649endocannabinoids, cannabinoids and other substances in fetal brain developmentexamining the effects of cannabinoids alone or with other addictive substances on the developing brain, from pre-, peri-, to post-natal brain development using human cell-based platforms or animal models. the endocannabinoid system plays important roles in central nervous system development, including neuronal and glial cell proliferation, differentiation, migration, and synaptogenesis in the embryonic and fetal developmental stages. prenatal cannabinoid exposure alters fetal brain development by affecting the endocannabinoid system and dysregulating the dopaminergic, gabaergic, and opioidergic neurotransmitter systems. research is critically needed to advance our understanding of the roles of endocannabinoid system in the developing brain, the effects of cannabinoids in the absence and presence of other drugs of abuse during fetal brain development, and the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying these interactions.program contact: da-yu wu, ph.d., wudy@nida.nih.gov, 301-435-4649application and submission informationthis notice applies to due dates on or after june 5, 2022 and subsequent receipt dates through september 8, 2025.submit applications for this initiative using one of the following funding opportunity announcements (foas) or any reissues of these announcement through the expiration date of this notice.all instructions in the sf424 (r&r) application guide and the funding opportunity announcement used for submission must be followed, with the following additions:applications nonresponsive to terms of this nosi will not be considered for the nosi initiative.scientific/research contact(s)jonathan d. pollock, ph.d. national institute on drug abuse (nida) telephone: 301-435-1309 email: jpollock@mail.nih.govfinancial/grants management contact(s)pam fleming national institute on drug abuse (nida) telephone: 301-480-1159 email: pfleming@mail.nih.govweekly toc for this announcement nih funding opportunities and noticesnote: for help accessing pdf, rtf, ms word, excel, powerpoint, audio or video files, see help downloading files.
