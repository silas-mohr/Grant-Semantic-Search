goal of this program is to enhance the retention of investigators facing critical life events who are transitioning from mentored career development awards to research independence and to minimize departures from biomedical research workforce. this supplement program is intended to ensure continuity of research among recipients of mentored career development (k) awards by providing supplemental research support to help sustain the investigator’s research during a period in which the pd/pi experiences critical life events which have the potential to impact research progress or potential productivity. administrative supplements must support work within the scope of the original project.for the purposes of this program, critical life events that would qualify for consideration include childbirth, adoption, serious personal health issues or illness and/or debilitating conditions, high-risk pregnancy, and primary caregiving responsibilities of an ailing spouse, child, partner, parent or a member of the immediate family during the project. evidence that the circumstance may affect advancement of the mentored career development award or productivity must be provided. in circumstances in which the critical life event is pending and is expected to occur during the project period, the supplement request may be submitted in advance of the event. detailed personal health information such as specific diagnoses or medical conditions is not required or necessary to be considered for this supplement.mentored individual k awardees who are recipients of the k awards
