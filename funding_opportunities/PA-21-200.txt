behavior, interests, or activities. these complex disorders are usually of lifelong duration and affect multiple aspects of development, learning, and adaptation at home and in the community, thus representing a pressing public health need. the etiologies of these disorders are not yet understood, but may include a combination of genetic and environmental influences.basic research into the pathophysiology of asd, including research on brain mechanisms, is of special interest. also of high priority are clinical and applied investigations that may lead to the development of new treatments and interventions.areas of interest include, but are not limited to, those described below:epidemiology: studies of the genetic and environmental epidemiology of asd to determine risk and protective processes in the etiology of the disorder, including environmental exposures during pregnancy and early childhood; longitudinal studies of high-risk populations; epidemiologic research on the interplay of genetic and non-genetic (e.g., environmental and other modifiable exposures); studies of the developmental course of asd across the life-span; studies that characterize the range of phenotypic expression within families; and research that characterizes and quantifies risk and protective processes associated with co-occurring/co-morbid features.screening, early identification, and diagnosis: studies of key features of asd associated with various stages of development, including those focused on adults; development of new screening tools for use in a variety of settings; assessment of comorbid features including epilepsy; and the creation of new measures to be used in longitudinal studies, as well as measures that further differentiate subtypes of asd.genomic studies: unbiased and well-powered family-based or population-based genetic analyses that aim to: identify genomic factors influencing risk, symptom severity, phenotypic trajectories, and the spectrum of co-morbidities; identify specific susceptibility genes using whole genome/exome approaches; investigate epigenetic mechanisms and long-range control of gene expression; use systems approaches that incorporate multiple types of -omics data; and detect locus heterogeneity.brain mechanisms: studies of brain mechanisms underlying the development, regulation, and modulation of behaviors characterizing asd, particularly those mechanisms involving social communication and sensory processing; studies of brain mechanisms involved in the development of abnormal electroencephalograms and epilepsy, and studies to clarify the subtypes of seizures and seizure disorders in asd; studies using model systems to examine brain mechanisms related to asd; and studies using novel reagents and tools to identify molecular, cellular, or developmental mechanisms relevant to asd.shared neurobiology of asd with fragile x syndrome, and other related disorders: studies of developmental and functional processes, pathways, and brain mechanisms that will lead to an understanding of shared etiology or pathophysiology among these disorders; analysis of autism-related neurobiological and behavioral phenotypes in related monogenic disorders; and analyses that would identify useful and specific clinical endpoints that would register measurable improvements in response to treatment interventions in clinical populations.cognitive science: developmental studies of relevant behaviors during infancy including attention to social and nonsocial stimuli, affective behavior, gaze, imitation, reciprocity and play, and their emergence in infants with, or at-risk for, asd; research on social behavior and social cognition across the life-span; studies leading to more sophisticated measures of higher cognitive functioning, especially in social communication; and studies of sensorimotor factors and multisensory integration.communication skills: longitudinal developmental studies of behaviors that are precursors to later communication, and their emergence in children with asd; research on sensory, motor, and social-cognitive impairments that impact interaction and communication; and studies of predictors of atypical onset patterns in expressive language abilities.services research: research on the organization, delivery, coordination, implementation, and financing of services for persons with asd and their families, within or across service settings; studies aimed at better identifying and addressing changes in service and rehabilitative needs across the life-span, including during transitions from childhood to adolescence, and adolescence to adulthood; studies of ways to coordinate, implement or integrate services across settings including specialty mental health, general health, and other settings such as educational, vocational, and housing services, in order to maximize receipt of appropriate services; and research on assessing the value and improving the efficiency of the delivery, scale-up and sustainability of needed services.this foa will support mechanistic clinical trials, as defined by the nih to include studies designed to understand a biological or behavioral process, the pathophysiology of a disease, or the mechanism of action of an intervention. the proposed human clinical studies will meet the nih definition of a clinical trial (see not-od-15-015), but will not include studies whose purpose is to evaluate safety; clinical efficacy, effectiveness, and management; and/or implementation. such trials will not be supported by this foa. applicants proposing clinical trials that are not supported by this foa should refer to the relevant ic's clinical trial policies and foas.applicants are also strongly encouraged to review the information provided on the support for clinical trials at nimh webpage and not-mh-21-105, "consolidated notice on nimh clinical trials policies".the nimh has published updated policies and guidance for investigators regarding human research protection and clinical research data and safety monitoring (not-mh-19-027). the application’s protection of human subjects and clinical trials information and data and safety monitoring plans should reflect the policies and guidance in this notice. plans for the protection of research subjects and data and safety monitoring

research as broadly and effectively as possible, investigators funded under this foa who are collecting data from humans are expected to share those data among asd researchers through a broadly accessible repository addressing the needs of the autism research community, e.g., via the national database for autism research, now housed under the umbrella of the nimh data archives (nda;http://nda.nih.gov). fulfilling this expectation by the awardee will be among the terms and conditions of the award. established by the nimh, and supported by other nih institutes, the nda is a secure informatics platform for scientific collaboration and data-sharing that enables the effective communication of detailed research data, results, tools, and supporting documentation. all human subjects data collected and/or derived for a project funded under this foa are expected to be submitted to the nda. data resulting from existing samples, cells, or sequences previously collected are also expected to be submitted to the nda. products such as tools, pipelines, and algorithms that will not result in a commercial product are expected to be shared via the nda study.investigators funded under this foa are expected to use nda technologies to submit data in accordance with the nda data sharing terms and conditions, incorporated by reference, which can be found at https://nda.nih.gov/contribute/sharing-regimen.html. a resource sharing plan, formulated in accordance with these nda data sharing terms and conditions, should be included in the grant application. the nda links data across research projects through its global unique identifier (guid) and data dictionary technologies. investigators funded under this foa are expected to use these technologies to submit and share their research data and results at the appropriate times. to accomplish this objective, it will be important to formulate a) an enrollment and consent strategy that will obtain the information necessary to generate a guid for each research participant; and, b) a budget strategy that will cover the costs of data sharing. the nda cost estimation tool is a customizable excel worksheet that can be used to calculate an estimate of the resources needed to submit and share data with the nda. this resource estimate should be submitted as part of the application budget (http://nda.nih.gov/contribute_cost_estimation.html).when involving human subjects research, clinical research, and/or nih-defined clinical trials (and when applicable, clinical trials research experience) follow all instructions for the phs human subjects and clinical trials information form in the sf424 (r&r) application guide, with the following additional instructions:if you answered “yes” to the question “are human subjects involved?” on the r&r other project information form, you must include at least one human subjects study record using the study record: phs human subjects and clinical trials information form or delayed onset study record.study record: phs human subjects and clinical trials informationall instructions in the sf424 (r&r) application guide must be
