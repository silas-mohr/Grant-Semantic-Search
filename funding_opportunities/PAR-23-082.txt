team science approach to gain a comprehensive mechanistic understanding of the impact of sex differences on the molecular trajectories of brain aging on the phenotypes of risk and resilience to alzheimer's disease (ad) and ad-related dementias (adrd), and on the molecular determinants underlying responsiveness to pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic interventions.30 days prior to the application due dateall applications are due by 5:00 pm local time of applicant organization.applicants are encouraged to apply early to allow adequate time to make any corrections to errors found in the application during the submission process by the due date.not applicableit is critical that applicants follow the instructions in the research (r) instructions in the sf424 (r&r) application guide, except where instructed to do otherwise (in this foa or in a notice from nih guide for grants and contracts).conformance to all requirements (both in the application guide and the foa) is required and strictly enforced. applicants must read and follow all application instructions in the application guide as well as any program-specific instructions noted in section iv. when the program-specific instructions deviate from those in the application guide, follow the program-specific instructions.applications that do not comply with these instructions may be delayed or not accepted for review.there are several options available to submit your application through grants.gov to nih and department of health and human services partners. you must use one of these submission options to access the application forms for this opportunity.backgroundalzheimer’s disease (ad) is a highly heterogeneous, multifactorial disorder with a long prodromal period. the development of effective interventions to prevent or delay the onset of ad is critically dependent on gaining an in-depth understanding of how multiple etiologies and prodromal phenotypes lead to neurodegenerative changes that result in cognitive decline and dementia. a large body of evidence from clinical and laboratory research has demonstrated that sex differences help determine physiologic status and are a major source of disease heterogeneity for many diseases, including neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders such as ad and parkinson’s disease.sex differences with regard to the risk of ad, vulnerability to apoe genetic load, and severity of ad pathology burden have been established. sex differences exist for many of the physiologic states and co-morbid conditions known to be risk factors for ad, such as inflammation, obesity, and cardiovascular diseases. in addition, multiple genes in the molecular processes/pathways involved in ad pathogenesis, such as brain bioenergetics, are located on the x-chromosome. numerous animal model studies have pointed to multiple neuroprotective effects of estrogen and other sex steroids; however, evidence from clinical trials has been mixed and controversial.given that fundamental issues regarding sex-related phenotypes relevant to the heterogeneity of ad and responsiveness to pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions remain underexplored at the mechanistic level, it is necessary to build cross-disciplinary research programs that will fill in the critical knowledge gaps and inform the development of precision medicine for treatment and prevention. the central goal of this initiative is to develop robust research programs that will explore how genes, environment, and host factors such as hormonal status (gonadal and brain-derived) interact at various levels of biologic complexity (i.e., cell, tissue, organs/organ systems, and populations) to produce heterogeneous phenotypes of disease risk and responsiveness to prevention/therapy in ad and ad-related dementias (adrd).objectivesthis funding opportunity announcement (foa) invites applications that integrate experimental and computational approaches as well as basic and translational/clinical research towards a comprehensive understanding of the impact of sex differences on the trajectories of brain aging and disease, phenotypes of ad/adrd risk and resilience, and responsiveness to pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic interventions. to this end, this foa encourages research focused on, but not limited to, the following areas:a cross-disciplinary team-science approach that brings together experts in neuroscience, physiology, computational biology and data science, and translational and clinical research is strongly encouraged, as is the integrative use of human data and biosamples with cell-based and animal models.this foa encourages studies that integrate and analyze multimodal data, such as multi-omics, imaging, and clinical data, as well as electronic health records and digital health data from biosensors or smart devices. of particular interest are projects that use biosamples and/or data collected from prior or ongoing clinical trials to assess sex differences in response to interventions and to examine the molecular basis of this effect.this foa will support mechanistic clinical trials, defined by the nih as including studies designed to understand a biological or behavioral process, or the pathophysiology of a disease process, through manipulation of that process, or to understand the mechanism of action of an intervention (see not-od-15-015).applicants are strongly encouraged to contact nia scientific/research staff early in the pre-submission process to ensure that their application is responsive to the programmatic goals of this foa.non-responsiveness criteriaapplicants are expected to follow open-science, open-source principles and adhere to nih guidelines for rigorous study design and transparent reporting to maximize the reproducibility and translatability of their findings. please refer to the resource sharing plan section of this foa for detailed guidance.responsive applications should include appropriate support for curation and annotation of the molecular and clinical data types used and/or generated on the project to maximize the usability of the data by the broader research community.all studies should be conducted and reported in compliance with nih guidance on rigor and reproducibility. in particular, investigators proposing animal model studies are expected to follow the general arrive guidelines for rigorous animal research and the best practices guidelines for ad preclinical efficacy studies.although animal models can hold promising potential to advance translational efforts, the specific rationale for their use must be sufficiently justified, and compliance with the public health service (phs) policy on humane care and use of laboratory animals (policy) is an absolute requirement. all institutions are required to comply, as applicable, with the animal welfare act, and other federal statutes and regulations relating to animals.nia supports a central resource to nia staff and extramural investigators to facilitate/support the conduct and management of clinical research. this resource, the clinical research operations management system (croms), is a comprehensive data management system to support the business functions, management, and oversight responsibilities of nia grants that support the conduct of clinical research with human subjects. it is the expectation by nia that all successful applicants will interface, integrate, or adapt their information system(s) and processes to interact with existing and future components of the croms as necessary, including the use of croms data templates as specified.see section viii. other information for award authorities and regulations.investigators

https://www.hhs.gov/civil-rights/for-providers/provider-obligations/index.html and https://www.hhs.gov/civil-rights/for-individuals/nondiscrimination/index.htmlhhs recognizes that research projects are often limited in scope for many reasons that are nondiscriminatory, such as the principal investigator’s scientific interest, funding limitations, recruitment requirements, and other considerations. thus, criteria in research protocols that target or exclude certain populations are warranted where nondiscriminatory justifications establish that such criteria are appropriate with respect to the health or safety of the subjects, the scientific study design, or the purpose of the research. for additional guidance regarding how the provisions apply to nih grant programs, please contact the scientific/research contact that is identified in section vii under agency contacts of this foa.please contact the hhs office for civil rights for more information about obligations and

this program will be the cooperative agreement, an "assistance" mechanism (rather than an "acquisition" mechanism), in which substantial nih programmatic involvement with the recipients is anticipated during the performance of the activities. under the cooperative agreement, the nih purpose is to support and stimulate the recipients' activities by involvement in and otherwise working jointly with the recipients in a partnership role; it is not to assume direction, prime responsibility, or a dominant role in the activities. consistent with this concept, the dominant role and prime responsibility resides with the recipients for the project as a whole, although specific tasks and activities may be shared among the recipients and the nih as defined below.the pd(s)/pi(s) will have the primary responsibility for:defining the details for the projects within the guidelines of this foa. the pd/pi will agree to accept the close coordination, cooperation, and participation of the nih staff (project scientists) in those aspects of scientific and technical management of the projects as described below. specifically, the pd/pi(s) supported by this initiative will do the following:nih staff have substantial programmatic involvement that is above and beyond the normal stewardship role in awards, as described below:one or more designated nih program staff members, acting as project scientists, will have substantial programmatic involvement that is above and beyond the normal stewardship role in awards. the role of the project scientist(s) will be to facilitate and not to direct.

conflict of interest issues.areas of joint responsibility include:the nih project scientist(s) and the pds/pis of the 'impact of sex differences on ad/adrd consortium' will be jointly responsible for the coordination of intra-program activities and the integration of individual projects with other appropriate nia and nih programs. joint responsibilities include the following:dispute resolution:any disagreements that may arise in scientific or programmatic matters (within the scope of the award) between recipients and the nih may be brought to dispute resolution. a dispute resolution panel composed of three members will be convened. it will have three members: a designee of the steering committee chosen without nih staff voting, one nih designee, and a third designee with expertise in the relevant area who is chosen by the other two; in the case of individual disagreement, the first member may be chosen by the individual recipient. this special dispute resolution procedure does not alter the recipient's right to appeal an adverse action that is otherwise appealable in accordance with phs regulation 42 cfr part 50, subpart d and dhhs regulation 45 cfr part 16.3. data management
