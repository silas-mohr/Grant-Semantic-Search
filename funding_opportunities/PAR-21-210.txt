national institutes of health (nih)national institute of mental health (nimh)r01 research project grantsee notices of special interest associated with this funding opportunitysee section iii. 3. additional information on eligibility.nimh seeks applications for research projects to evaluate the effectiveness of therapeutic and service delivery interventions for the post-acute management of mental health conditions affecting youth, adults, and older adults. this funding opportunity announcement (foa) encourages clinical trials to establish the effectiveness and test hypotheses regarding moderators, mediators, and mechanisms of action of post-acute phase therapeutic and services interventions that are matched to the stage of illness in terms of both their focus (e.g., consolidating and maintaining gains from initial treatment, managing residual symptoms/impairment, preventing relapse, promoting adherence and appropriate service use) and intensity/burden for promoting optimal longer-term outcomes.this foa is intended to support trials that are statistically powered to provide a definitive answer regarding the effectiveness of the post-acute phase intervention. support for pilot effectiveness trials designed to evaluate the initial feasibility, tolerability, acceptability, safety and preliminary indications of post-acute phase intervention approaches is provided via the r34, par-21-211.30 days prior to the application due dateall applications are due by 5:00 pm local time of applicant organization. all types of non-aids applications allowed for this funding opportunity announcement are due on the listed date(s).applicants are encouraged to apply early to allow adequate time to make any corrections to errors found in the application during the submission process by the due date.not applicableit is critical that applicants follow the instructions in the research (r) instructions in the sf424 (r&r) application guide,except where instructed to do otherwise (in this foa or in a notice from nih guide for grants and contracts ).conformance to all requirements (both in the application guide and the foa) is required and strictly enforced. applicants must read and follow all application instructions in the application guide as well as any program-specific instructions noted in section iv. when the program-specific instructions deviate from those in the application guide, follow the program-specific instructions.applications that do not comply with these instructions may be delayed or not accepted for review.there are several options available to submit your application through grants.gov to nih and department of health and human services partners. you must use one of these submission options to access the application forms for this opportunity.rationalewhile there has been progress at developing therapeutic and services interventions for the acute management of many mental health disorders, far less attention has been paid to developing and testing mental health interventions and services to improve longer-term outcomes and recovery of function. more research on post-acute phase interventions and services is warranted given that mental health conditions are often chronic or relapsing (e.g., anxiety disorders, mood disorders, adhd, psychotic disorders) and are often better conceptualized and managed as chronic conditions. the clinical response to currently available pharmacological, device-based and psychosocial interventions is often incomplete. therapeutic gains can dissipate with time, and residual symptoms and impairment pose risk for relapse and ongoing dysfunction. even when acute treatment is successful, the risk for associated downstream comorbidities (e.g., substance abuse disorders) remains high. management of many mental disorders requires not only ongoing treatment to prevent symptom recurrence, but interventions to promote long-term adherence to treatment plans and engagement with providers and health systems.research scope and objectivesthe purpose of this foa is to encourage research projects to assess the effectiveness of therapeutic and services interventions for the post-acute phase management of mental health conditions affecting youth and adults, including older adults. the clinical trial should also be designed and sufficiently powered to definitively test effectiveness. the study should also be designed to address hypotheses regarding predictors and moderators of effectiveness, in order to examine whether the intervention engages the target/mechanism(s) presumed to underlie the intervention effects and to address questions regarding the role of such mechanisms in producing clinical benefit.for purposes of this foa, acute treatment refers to the management of an episode, crisis, or worsening of mental illness that requires intense treatment in order to contain symptoms, prevent harm, and stabilize functioning, in either outpatient or hospital settings. while the goal of acute treatment is typically symptomatic improvement, management of immediate risks for harm, and behavioral stabilization, continuation and maintenance treatment aims to achieve symptom recovery and return the patient to an optimal baseline of functioning, while preventing relapse and recurrence. likewise, following acute-phase treatment, additional interventions and/or services might be necessary to facilitate care transitions (e.g., from inpatient services to outpatient care) or promote appropriate adherence and continuity of services.across conditions, post-acute phase interventions/service strategies are needed that are matched to the stage of illness in terms of both their focus (e.g., consolidating and maintaining gains from initial treatment, managing residual symptoms/impairment, preventing relapse, promoting adherence and appropriate service use) and intensity/burden, in order to ensure that the interventions are not only relevant and effective, but also acceptable and sustainable for promoting optimal longer-term outcomes. technology-assisted approaches might be especially useful for facilitating post-acute phase monitoring, for delivering interventions (e.g., maintenance therapy, relapse prevention), and for promoting treatment engagement/adherence and appropriate service use.nimh is committed to supporting research that reduces disparities and advances equity in mental health interventions, services, and outcomes. accordingly, this foa encourages clinical trials that seek to reduce disparities in post-acute care outcomes for racial and ethnic minority groups, individuals limited by language or cultural barriers, sexual and gender minorities, individuals living in rural areas, socioeconomically disadvantaged persons and other underserved groups.examples of relevant research topics include but are not limited to:consistent with the nimh experimental therapeutics approach, this foa is intended to support effectiveness trials that not only test the intervention effects on outcomes of interest but also explicitly inform understanding regarding whether the intervention engages associated change mechanisms that were previously identified under more controlled, efficacy conditions, thereby reconfirming the intervention targets and testing whether previously identified change mechanisms are operative in the effectiveness context (see nimh web page on clinical trials). in this manner, the results of the effectiveness trial will advance knowledge regarding therapeutic change mechanisms and have utility regardless of trial outcomes (e.g., in the event of negative results, information about whether the intervention was successful at engaging its targets can facilitate interpretation).depending on the nature of the intervention, the "targets" or mechanism of action might involve specific psychological or behavioral processes (e.g., attention bias, cognitive control, stress regulation) or neurobiological entities (e.g., brain circuits). for studies that involve preventive or therapeutic interventions, nimh encourages research that takes into account rdoc or rdoc-like constructs when defining the subject eligibility (inclusion), intervention targets or mechanisms, and outcomes, as appropriate and feasible in the effectiveness setting. in the case of services interventions, targets/mechanisms might involve mutable consumer- or provider-behaviors, or organizational-/system-level factors that are intervened upon in order to improve access, continuity, quality, equity, and/or value of services.valid and reliable measures of change in the hypothesized target(s)/mechanism(s) will provide useful information about key change mechanisms that account for intervention effects. in the assessment of target engagement, nimh encourages the use of measures that are as direct and objective as is feasible in the effectiveness setting. specifically encouraged are empirically validated measures of the construct that extend beyond self-reports and other subjective measures, where possible, and inclusion of measures that span more than one level of assessment if possible and appropriate.nimh encourages a deployment-focused model of intervention and services design and testing that considers the perspective of key stakeholders (e.g., service users, providers, administrators, payers) and the characteristics of the settings (e.g., resources, including workforce capacity; existing clinical workflows) where optimized mental health interventions and services are intended to be implemented. this attention to end-user perspectives and characteristics of intended clinical and/or community practice settings is intended to ensure that the resultant interventions and service delivery strategies are feasible and scalable, and to ensure that the research results will have utility for end users.nimh encourages projects testing the effectiveness of preventive, therapeutic, or services interventions that are designed as hybrid effectiveness-implementation trials, as appropriate, depending on the level of pre-existing effectiveness evidence and implementation readiness. thus, in addition to testing the effectiveness of a preventive or therapeutic intervention, nimh encourages effectiveness trials that are designed to assess and examine consumer-, provider- and setting- level factors that might be associated with implementation fidelity (i.e., as hybrid type-i trials) or to simultaneously test strategies to promote successful implementation (i.e., as hybrid type ii trials). likewise, studies that are primarily aimed at testing an implementation or dissemination strategy should be designed to also assess the outcomes and effectiveness of the intervention/approach that is being implemented, as appropriate and feasible (i.e., as hybrid type iii trials).nimh encourages effectiveness research on potentially scalable preventive, therapeutic, and services interventions that focuses on practice-relevant questions. accordingly, collaborations between academic researchers and clinical or community practice partners or networks are encouraged. when possible, studies should capitalize on existing infrastructure (e.g., practice-based research networks such as the nimh-sponsored mental health research network (mhrn) and early psychosis intervention network (epinet), electronic medical records, administrative data bases, patient registries, institutions with clinical and translational science awards) to increase the efficiency of participant recruitment (i.e., more rapid identification and enrollment) and to facilitate the collection of moderator data (e.g., clinical characteristics, biomarkers), longer-term follow-up data, and broader, stakeholder-relevant outcomes (e.g., mental health and general health care utilization, value and efficiency of intervention approaches).nimh encourages studies that test intervention and service delivery strategies that incorporate features that are specifically designed to prevent threats to implementation fidelity, as appropriate. strategies that might be used to enhance scalability and sustained implementation include but are not limited to: consumer-facing technology (e.g., self-administered content) and provider-facing technology (e.g., technology to support provider training and sustained implementation fidelity); expert consultation via existing resources or other sustainable means (e.g., telehealth, collaborative care approaches); or other robust design features that promote provider competence and sustained implementation fidelity.effective prevention and treatment of mental illness have the potential to reduce morbidity and mortality associated with intentional injury (i.e., suicide attempts and deaths, see: www.suicide-research-agenda.org). lack of attention to the assessment of these outcomes has limited our understanding regarding the degree to which effective mental health interventions might offer prophylaxis. where feasible and appropriate, nimh encourages intervention research that includes assessment of suicidal behavior in order to advance understanding of how effective prevention and treatment of mental disorders might impact suicide relevant outcomes.information about the mission, strategic plan, and research interests of the nimh can be found on the nimh website. applicants are also strongly encouraged to review the information on support for clinical trials at nimh.potential applicants are also strongly encouraged to consult with nih staff as early as possible when developing plans for an application (see scientific/research contacts, section vii). this early contact will provide an opportunity to clarify nih policies and guidelines and help to identify whether the proposed project is consistent with nimh program priorities and the goals of this foa.applications not responsive to this foathe following will be considered nonresponsive to this foa and will not be reviewed:scale and scope of studies covered under this announcementthis foa is intended to support effectiveness trials testing post-acute phase interventions that are statistically powered to provide a definitive answer regarding the study intervention's effectiveness in comparison to usual care practices or alternative intervention/services approaches. the study should also be designed to address hypotheses regarding predictors and moderators of effectiveness, to examine whether the intervention engages the target/mechanism(s) presumed to underlie the intervention effects, and to address questions regarding the action of such mechanisms in producing clinical benefit. support for pilot effectiveness trials to inform the design of definitive effectiveness trials and to evaluate the initial feasibility, tolerability, acceptability, safety and preliminary indications of effectiveness of post-acute phase intervention approaches is provided via par-21-211,"pilot effectiveness trials for post-acute interventions and services to optimize longer-term outcomes (r34)".this foa is intended to support research focused on the effectiveness of therapeutic and service-delivery interventions: (1) that are intended specifically for the post-acute management of mental health conditions, and (2) that principally involve the use of research-supported strategies (e.g., in sequence or in combination), matched to the stage of illness. applicants are encouraged to visit the nimh clinical trials webpage for a list of alternative foas, including foas that are intended to support the translation of emerging basic science findings of mechanisms and processes underlying mental disorders into novel psychosocial interventions ("development of psychosocial therapeutic and preventive interventions for mental disorders," (par-21-135 (r61/r33) and par-21-134 (r33)) and novel pharmacological or device-based interventions (“early stage testing of pharmacologic or device-based interventions for the treatment of mental disorders," (par-21-137 (r61/r33) and par-21-136 (r33)). effectiveness research for acute-phase interventions is supported through additional foas, including "pilot effectiveness trials for treatment, prevention and services interventions" (par-21-131 (r34)) and "clinical trials to test the effectiveness of treatment, preventive, and services interventions" (par-21-130 (r01) and par-21-129 (collaborative r01)).all pd(s)/pi(s)s submitting clinical trials applications consistent with nimh priorities are encouraged to visit the nimh clinical trials webpage and consult with

advancing research through widespread data sharing among researchers, investigators funded under this foa are expected to share those data via the national data archive (nda; see not-mh-19-033). established by the nih, nda is a secure informatics platform for scientific collaboration and data-sharing that enables the effective communication of detailed research data, tools, and supporting documentation. nda links data across research projects through its global unique identifier (guid) and data dictionary technology. investigators funded under this foa are expected to use these technologies to submit data to nda.to accomplish this objective, it will be important to formulate a) an enrollment strategy that will obtain the information necessary to generate a guid for each participant, and b) a budget strategy that will cover the costs of data submission. the nda web site provides two tools to help investigators develop appropriate strategies: 1) the nda data submission cost model which offers a customizable excel worksheet that includes tasks and hours for the program director/principal investigator and data manager to budget for data sharing; and 2) plain language text to be considered in your informed consent available from the nda's data contribution page. investigators are expected to certify the quality of all data generated by grants funded under this foa prior to submission to nda and review their data for accuracy after submission. submission of descriptive/raw data is expected semi-annually (every january 15 and july 15); submission of all other data is expected at the time of publication, or prior to the end of the grant, whichever occurs first (see nda sharing regimen for more information); investigators are expected to share results, positive and negative, specific to the cohorts and outcome measures studied. the nda data sharing plan is available for review on the nda website. nda staff will work with investigators to help them submit data types not yet defined in the nda data dictionary.research strategy: applicants should include the following sections as part of the research strategy. applications should not duplicate information provided in the attachment described in the phs human subjects clinical trial information form but may reference it to provide context as needed.significanceinnovationapproachas

mission are evaluated for scientific and technical merit through the nih peer review system.a proposed clinical trial application may include study design, methods, and intervention that are not by themselves innovative but address important questions or unmet needs. additionally, the results of the clinical trial may indicate that further clinical development of the intervention is unwarranted or lead to new avenues of scientific investigation.reviewers will provide an overall impact score to reflect their assessment of the likelihood for the project to exert a sustained, powerful influence on the research field(s) involved, in consideration of the following review criteria and additional review criteria (as applicable for the project proposed).reviewers will consider each of the review criteria below in the determination of scientific merit, and give a separate score for each. an application does not need to be strong in all categories to be judged likely to have major scientific impact. for example, a project that by its nature is not innovative may be essential to advance a field.does the project address an important problem or a critical barrier to progress in the field? is the prior research that serves as the key support for the proposed project rigorous? if the aims of the project are achieved, how will scientific knowledge, technical capability, and/or clinical practice be improved? how will successful completion of the aims change the concepts, methods, technologies, treatments, services, or preventative interventions that drive this field?how well does the application justify the practical effect of the intervention or service approach in terms of the estimated hypothesized effect size (e.g., in terms of remediation of residual symptoms or functional impairment, reduced likelihood of relapse or re-hospitalization, improved adherence), compared with already available approaches? how well does the application address both (1) the empirical basis for the anticipated effect size (e.g., citing data regarding the magnitude of the association between the target and the clinical endpoint of interest and/or effect sizes obtained in prior efficacy studies), and (2) the clinical meaningfulness of the anticipated increment in effects compared to existing approaches?if the approach is successful, what are the potential scalability and potential for dissemination into practice given typically available resources (e.g., trained, skilled providers), typical service structures (including health care financing), and typical service use patterns?are the scientific rationale and need for a clinical trial to test the proposed hypothesis or intervention well supported by preliminary data, clinical and/or preclinical studies, or information in the literature or knowledge of biological mechanisms? for trials focusing on clinical or public health endpoints, is this clinical trial necessary for testing the safety, efficacy or effectiveness of an intervention that could lead to a change in clinical practice, community behaviors or health care policy? for trials focusing on mechanistic, behavioral, physiological, biochemical, or other biomedical endpoints, is this trial needed to advance scientific understanding?are the pd(s)/pi(s), collaborators, and other researchers well suited to the project? if early stage investigators or those in the early stages of independent careers, do they have appropriate experience and training? if established, have they demonstrated an ongoing record of accomplishments that have advanced their field(s)? if the project is collaborative or multi-pd/pi, do the investigators have complementary and integrated expertise; are their leadership approach, governance and organizational structure appropriate for the project?with regard to the proposed leadership for the project, do the pd/pi(s) and key personnel have the expertise, experience, and ability to organize, manage and implement the proposed clinical trial and meet milestones and timelines? do they have appropriate expertise in study coordination, data management and statistics? for a multicenter trial,
