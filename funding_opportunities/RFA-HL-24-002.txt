options to access the application forms for this opportunity.purposethis limited competition funding opportunity announcement (foa) is to support the data coordinating center (dcc) for the pediatric heart network (phn) (https://www.pediatricheartnetwork.org/), whose mission is to improve the health of children and adults with structural congenital heart defects, as well as children with acquired heart disease through multi-center clinical research. a companion foa for clinical research centers (crcs) is available; see rfa-hl-24-001 pediatric heart network clinical research centers (um1 clinical trial optional).background and objectivescongenital cardiac malformations affect about 1% of live births and are the primary cause of death under age 1 due to a birth defect. due to improved surgical and management techniques, survival has increased significantly in recent decades, and the number of adults living with congenital heart disease is now approximately twice the number of affected children. acquired heart disease affects thousands of additional children each year.the phn has been a research enterprise since 2001 with established best practices for multi-center research in pediatric cardiology. during this funding cycle, the phn will retain its infrastructure consisting of a dcc and up to nine crcs. the phn foas will support this infrastructure for seven years, including a number of trials and other studies as permitted by the budget. phn investigators will be encouraged to seek funding for additional trials and studies through investigator-initiated grants, industry participation, and foundation grants.the dcc will work with nhlbi, the crcs, and other stakeholders to improve patient outcomes through clinical trials and other clinical studies of congenital heart disease in children and adults and of pediatric acquired heart disease.the objectives for this limited competition foa are to address a comprehensive plan to provide overall project coordination, administration, data management, and bolster biostatistical support, while emphasizing patient engagement, equity, and collaboration with multiple sites and other research entities through data science strategies. in particular, this foa seeks an application, from the current phn dcc, that proposes activities to meet the following broad goals:organization and governancethe phn is a cooperative network of crcs, a dcc, an independent protocol review committee, a data and safety monitoring board (dsmb) and nhlbi project scientists.the crcs are supported by a separate award, described in detail in rfa-hl-24-001.the dcc is expected to participate in a cooperative and interactive manner with the crcs and nhlbi. crcs are responsible for proposing, developing, and refining protocols; identifying, recruiting and retaining study participants including those nih-designated health disparity populations such as american indians/alaska natives, asian americans, blacks/african americans, hispanics/latinos, native hawaiians and other pacific islanders, sexual and gender minorities, socioeconomically disadvantaged populations, and underserved rural populations ; entering data promptly and accurately into the electronic data capture system; contributing to manuscripts and otherwise disseminating research findings; and contributing to phn governance through committee participation.the executive committee is the main governing body of the phn and is composed of the principal investigators (pis) of the core crcs and the dcc, the chairs of select phn committees, a study coordinator and the nhlbi project scientists.each member has one vote; the nhlbi staff has one collective vote.the steering committee consists of phn investigators from all sites (the 9 main crcs funded through this foa and auxiliary sites funded through subcontracts with the dcc to support recruitment in specific studies) , the dcc, and nhlbi staff. phn investigators, study coordinators, dcc statisticians and staff, and nhlbi staff meet in person an average of twice a year and by teleconference on a monthly basis, as needed.the dcc supports protocol development; provides sample size calculations, sophisticated statistical advice, and data analysis; supports manuscript preparation; and provides overall study coordination and quality assurance, including coordination of the activities of the dsmb and other standing committees. funds to support the patient care costs associated with the protocols will be part of the dcc award and will be distributed to the crcs by the dcc on a per-patient basis and according to the approved protocol budgets.the phn's scientific and administrative work is assisted by a variety of committees whose membership is drawn from the crcs, the dcc, and the nhlbi.committees may include protocol development, publications, finance, core lab, ancillary studies, nursing research, biospecimens, health services research, and other committees as needed to support phn activities.nhlbi is responsible for strategic direction and support for the phn. the nhlbi program office and office of grants management are responsible for the overall management. in addition to regular grant stewardship, the nhlbi project scientists will be involved substantially with the awardees as a scientific partner, consistent with the cooperative agreement mechanism.the phn’s nhlbi-appointed dsmb monitors patient safety and reviews performance of each study. as a part of its monitoring responsibility, the dsmb submits recommendations to the nhlbi regarding the conduct and continuation of each protocol.participation in/selection of trialsmultiple trials and other clinical studies will be conducted during the project period. once the crcs are convened in the new funding cycle, the phn executive and steering committees will consider proposed protocols and prioritize them. it is expected that each approved protocol will be implemented in all of the core crcs. the ability to conduct specific protocols will depend on scientific priority and the availability of funds. sites will be reimbursed to conduct the protocols on a capitated basis. the dcc will manage approval of clinical protocols by the phn’s single irb.the number of protocols supported in the program will depend on the nature and extent of the investigations proposed and on available funds. both short and long-term projects will be considered.notice of nih's interest in diversityevery facet of the united states scientific research enterprise—from basic laboratory research to clinical and translational research to policy formation–requires superior intellect, creativity and a wide range of skill sets and viewpoints. nih’s ability to help ensure that the nation remains a global leader in scientific discovery and innovation is dependent upon a pool of highly talented scientists from diverse backgrounds who will help to further nih's mission. research shows that diverse teams working together and capitalizing on innovative ideas and distinct perspectives outperform homogenous teams. scientists and trainees from diverse backgrounds and life experiences bring different perspectives, creativity, and individual enterprise to address complex scientific problems. there are many benefits that flow from a diverse nih-supported scientific workforce, including: fostering scientific innovation, enhancing global competitiveness, contributing to robust learning environments, improving the quality of the research, advancing the likelihood that underserved or health disparity populations participate in, and benefit from health research, and enhancing public trust. in spite of tremendous advancements in scientific research, information, educational and research opportunities are not equally available to all. nih encourages institutions to diversify their student and faculty populations to enhance the participation of individuals from groups that are underrepresented in the biomedical, clinical, behavioral and social sciences. see not-od-20-031 and reminder: notice of nih's encouragement of applications supporting individuals from underrepresented ethnic and racial groups as well as individuals with disabilities not-od-22-019 for details.to support the best science, the phn encourages inclusivity in research. examples of

to help ensure the safety of participants enrolled in nih-funded studies, the recipient must provide nih copies of documents related to all major changes in the status of ongoing protocols.2. administrative and national policy requirementsall nih grant and cooperative agreement awards include the nih grants policy statement as part of the noa. for these terms of award, see the nih grants policy statement part ii: terms and conditions of nih grant awards, subpart a: general and part ii: terms and conditions of nih grant awards, subpart b: terms and conditions for specific types of grants, recipients, and activities, including of note, but not limited to:if a recipient is successful and receives a notice of award, in accepting the award, the recipient agrees that any activities under the award are subject to all provisions currently in effect or implemented during the period of the award, other department regulations and policies in effect at the time of the award, and applicable statutory provisions.should the applicant organization successfully compete for an award, recipients of federal financial assistance (ffa) from hhs will be required to complete an hhs assurance of compliance form (hhs 690) in which the recipient agrees, as a term and condition of receiving the grant, to administer their programs in compliance with federal civil rights laws that prohibit discrimination on the basis of race, color, national origin, age, sex and disability, and agreeing to comply with federal conscience laws, where applicable. this includes ensuring that

please see https://www.hhs.gov/civil-rights/for-providers/provider-obligations/index.html and https://www.hhs.gov/civil-rights/for-individuals/nondiscrimination/index.htmlhhs recognizes that research projects are often limited in scope for many reasons that are nondiscriminatory, such as the principal investigator’s scientific interest, funding limitations, recruitment requirements, and other considerations. thus, criteria in research protocols that target or exclude certain populations are warranted where nondiscriminatory justifications establish that such criteria are appropriate with respect to the health or safety of the subjects, the scientific study design, or the purpose of the research. for additional guidance regarding how the provisions apply to nih grant programs, please contact the scientific/research contact that is identified in section vii under agency contacts of this foa.please contact the hhs office for civil rights for more information about obligations and prohibitions under federal civil rights laws at https://www.hhs.gov/ocr/about-us/contact-us/index.html or call 1-800-368-1019 or tdd 1-800-537-7697.in accordance with the statutory provisions

information system (fapiis) requirements. fapiis requires federal award making officials to review and consider information about an applicant in the designated integrity and performance system (currently fapiis) prior to making an award. an applicant, at its option, may review information in the designated integrity and performance systems accessible through fapiis and comment on any information about itself that a federal agency previously entered and is currently in fapiis. the federal awarding agency will consider any comments by the applicant, in addition to other information in fapiis, in making a judgement about the applicant’s integrity, business ethics, and record of performance under federal awards when completing the review of risk posed by applicants as described in 45 cfr part 75.205 and 2 cfr part 200.206 “federal awarding agency review of risk posed by applicants.” this provision will apply to all nih grants and cooperative agreements except fellowships.the

mechanism) in which substantial nih programmatic involvement with the awardees is anticipated during the performance of the activities. under the cooperative agreement, the nih purpose is to support and stimulate the recipients' activities by involvement in and otherwise working jointly with the award recipients in a partnership role; it is not to assume direction, prime responsibility, or a dominant role in the activities. consistent with this concept, the dominant role and prime responsibility resides with the awardees for the project as a whole, although specific tasks and activities may be shared among the awardees and the nih as defined below.the pd(s)/pi(s) will have the primary responsibility for:protocol development and subsequent amendments, recruitment materials, preparing protocol budgets in collaboration with the crcs, monitoring recruitment of study participants, assuring the quality of study participant protocol adherence, assuring the accurate and timely transmission of data, analyzing and interpreting data, preparing publications and public-use datasets, working with the crcs and nhlbi to disseminate research findings, and activities as outlined in the research strategy (section iv).monitoring and managing support or other involvement of industry or any other third party in a phn study, e.g., including contracting and data use agreements, any required regulatory activities, required reporting, and any other requirements.nih staff have substantial programmatic involvement that is above and beyond the normal stewardship role in awards, as described below:nih project scientists will have substantial programmatic involvement that is above and beyond the normal stewardship role in awards, as described below.the nhlbi project scientists will assist with development of research protocols, monitor patient recruitment and study progress, ensure disclosure of conflicts of interest, and ensure adherence to nhlbi policies. nhlbi is responsible for appointments to the phn’s standing data and safety monitoring board (dsmb).the nhlbi project scientists will serve on the executive and steering committees and other study committees, when appropriate, and will have one collective vote. the nhlbi project scientists will work with recipients on issues coming before the steering committee such as recruitment, protocol development, follow-up, quality control, adherence to protocol, possible changes to the protocol, interim data and safety monitoring, final data analysis and interpretation, preparation of publications, and development of solutions to major problems.in addition to the project scientist, a separate nhlbi program official will be responsible for the normal program stewardship of the cooperative agreement, and will be named in the notice of award. final decision-making authority on matters of budgetary and funding actions, grants management actions, and management of intellectual property issues is assigned to nhlbi staff other than the project scientist. the responsibility for final decision making may reside with senior institute management.the nhlbi reserves the right to phase-out or curtail the study (or an individual award) in the event of (a) failure to develop or implement mutually agreeable collaborative protocols; (b) substantial shortfall in participant recruitment, follow-up, data reporting, or quality control; (c) major breach of the protocols or substantive changes in the agreed-upon protocols with which nhlbi cannot concur; (d) attaining of a major study endpoint before schedule with persuasive statistical significance; or (e) human subject ethical issues that may dictate a premature termination.areas of joint responsibility include:governance of the phn through the executive committee. this committee has primary responsibility for identification of priority areas for research, management of the phn’s policies and procedures, oversight of the phn budget, and general phn operations. executive committee membership consists of all principal investigators, the chairs of select phn committees, a study coordinator, and the nhlbi project scientists. each member has one vote; the nhlbi staff has one collective vote.negotiation of mutually agreed upon performance and accrual milestones during the development of each clinical research protocol.support of the phn’s dsmb. the dsmb has been appointed by nhlbi to provide overall monitoring of interim data and safety issues. an nhlbi scientist, other than the nhlbi project scientist, serves as executive secretary to the dsmb, and is responsible for on-boarding new members, managing conflict of interest, and providing a summary of the recommendations from each meeting to the dcc. the dcc is responsible for preparing concise dsmb reports, and all dsmb meeting support. the lead principal investigator of each phn protocol presents updates to the dsmb a minimum of twice a year.dispute resolution:any disagreements that may arise in scientific or programmatic matters (within the scope of the award) between award recipients and the nih may be brought to dispute resolution. a dispute resolution panel composed of three members will be convened. it will have three members: a designee of the steering committee chosen without nih staff voting, one nih designee, and a third designee with expertise in the relevant area who is chosen by the other two; in the case of individual disagreement, the first member may be chosen by the individual awardee. this special dispute resolution procedure does not alter the awardee's right to appeal an adverse action that is otherwise appealable in accordance with phs regulations 42 cfr part 50, subpart d and hhs regulations 45 cfr part 16.3. data management and sharingnote: the nih policy for data management and sharing is effective for due dates on or after january 25, 2023.consistent with the nih policy for data management and sharing,
