in renewal of the determination that a public health emergency exists nationwide as the result of the continued consequences of the opioid crisis. this funding opportunity announcement (foa) invites applications from early and mid-career investigators (i.e. postdoctoral fellow/associates – associate professor) who strive to expand their research trajectories through the acquisition of new knowledge and skills in the areas of therapeutic drug, biologic, or device development. the development of novel treatments for pain, addiction, and overdose is a vital component to address the ongoing opioid epidemic. this development will be most effective if performed by scientists with experience in translational science. translation is defined as the process of turning observations in the laboratory, clinic and community into interventions that improve the health of individuals and the public — from diagnostics and therapeutics to medical procedures and behavioral changes, with translational science representing the field of investigation focused on understanding the scientific and operational principles underlying each step of the translational process (https://ncats.nih.gov/translation). traditional academic training provides deep knowledge of a relatively narrow scientific discipline. while domain expertise is an important characteristic of a proficient translational scientist, a comprehensive understanding of the stages of therapeutic development is also necessary. for many scientists, acquiring needed expertise through participatory involvement in the various fields that are required to compile an investigational new drug (ind), investigational device exemption (ide), or new drug application (nda) is extraordinarily difficult given the diversity of these domains. this foa is designed for early- and mid- career scientists with pain or opioid abuse expertise interested in receiving hands-on experience in translation at an industry laboratory, or an academic or government research center performing therapeutic development activities. the selected research environment should have the requisite capabilities and employ scientists and staff with expertise across the entire translational space for small molecule, biologic, or device development. areas of requisite capabilities and expertise include, but are not limited to: assay development, high-throughput screening technology, medicinal chemistry, analytical chemistry, advanced informatics, chemistry, manufacturing and controls (cmc), formulation, and toxicology needs assessments, risk assessment, benchtop models, in vitro models, in vivo models, cadaver testing, biocompatibility, shelf-life/stability, sterilization, leachables/extractables,

access the application forms for this opportunity.the overall goal of the nih research career development program is to help ensure that a diverse pool of highly trained scientists is available in appropriate scientific disciplines to address the nation's biomedical, behavioral, and clinical research needs. nih institutes and centers (ics) support a variety of mentored and non-mentored career development award programs designed to foster the transition of new investigators to research independence and to support established investigators in achieving specific objectives. candidates should review the different career development (k) award programs to determine the best program to support their goals. more information about career programs may be found at the nih extramural training mechanisms website.ncats is issuing this foa in response to the declared public health emergency issued by the secretary, hhs. please see determination that a public health emergency exists nationwide as the result of the opioid crisis as renewed in renewal of the determination that a public health emergency exists nationwide as the result of the continued consequences of the opioid crisis.the objective of the career enhancement award for experienced investigators (k18) is to provide support for experienced scientists who either wish to broaden their scientific capabilities or to make changes in their research careers by acquiring new research skills or knowledge. the purpose of this foa is to provide such investigators with support for an intensive period of mentored research experience to acquire new research capabilities in research areas supported by the sponsoring nih institute(s)/center(s). such experiences will afford candidate investigators protected time to: 1) enrich and expand their expertise and research programs through retooling in new techniques, emerging technologies, and/or scientific areas; and/or 2) redirect their research programs in new trajectories; and/or 3) catalyze research collaborations in new research directions. it is expected that this initiative will lead to new and/or augmented research programs competitive for nih funding.this opportunity is part of the nih’s helping to end addiction long-term (heal) initiative to speed scientific solutions to the national opioid public health crisis. the nih heal initiative bolsters research across nih to (1) improve treatment for opioid misuse and addiction and (2) enhance pain management. more information about the heal initiative is available at: https://heal.nih.gov/.in addition to scientific diversity, applicants should strive to incorporate diversity in their career enhancement plan. research shows that diverse teams working together and capitalizing on innovative ideas and distinct perspectives outperform homogenous teams. scientists and trainees from diverse backgrounds and life experiences bring different perspectives, creativity, and individual enterprise to address complex scientific problems. there are many benefits that flow from a diverse nih-supported scientific workforce, including: fostering scientific innovation, enhancing global competitiveness, contributing to robust learning environments, improving the quality of the research, advancing the likelihood that underserved or health disparity populations participate in, and benefit from health research, and enhancing public trust. please refer to notice of nih's interest in diversity not-od-20-031 for more details.enhancing diversityevery facet of the united states scientific research enterprise—from basic laboratory research to clinical and translational research to policy formation–requires superior intellect, creativity and a wide range of skill sets and viewpoints. nih's ability to help ensure that the nation remains a global leader in scientific discovery and innovation is dependent upon a pool of highly talented scientists from diverse backgrounds who will help to further nih's mission.research shows that diverse teams working together and capitalizing on innovative ideas and distinct perspectives outperform homogenous teams.

trust.underrepresented populations in the u.s. biomedical, clinical, behavioral and social sciences research enterprisein spite of tremendous advancements in scientific research, information, educational and research opportunities are not equally available to all. nih encourages institutions to diversify their student and faculty populations to enhance the participation of individuals from groups identified as nationally underrepresented in the biomedical, clinical, behavioral and social sciences, such as (not-od-20-031):a. individuals from racial and ethnic groups identified as underrepresented in health-related sciences on a national basis by the national science foundation (see data at http://www.nsf.gov/statistics/showpub.cfm?topid=2&subid=27) and the report women, minorities, and persons with disabilities in science and engineering. the following racial and ethnic groups have been shown to be underrepresented in biomedical research: blacks or african americans, hispanics or latinos, american indians or alaska natives, native hawaiians and other pacific islanders. in addition, it is recognized that underrepresentation can vary from setting to setting; individuals from racial or ethnic groups that are shown convincingly to be underrepresented by the grantee institution should be encouraged to participate in nih programs to enhance diversity. for more information on racial and ethnic categories and definitions, see the omb revisions to the standards for classification of federal data on race and ethnicity (https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/fr-1997-10-30/html/97-28653.htm).b. individuals with disabilities, who are defined as those with a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities, as described in the americans with disabilities act of 1990, as amended. see nsf data at, https://www.nsf.gov/statistics/2017/nsf17310/static/data/tab7-5.pdf.c. individuals from disadvantaged backgrounds, defined as those who meet two or more of the following criteria:students from low socioeconomic status (ses) backgrounds have been shown to obtain bachelor’s and advanced degrees at significantly lower rates than students from middle and high ses groups (see https://nces.ed.gov/programs/coe/indicator_tva.asp), and are subsequently less likely to be represented in biomedical research. for background see department of education data at: https://nces.ed.gov/;https://nces.ed.gov/programs/coe/indicator_tva.asp;https://www2.ed.gov/rschstat/research/pubs/advancing-diversity-inclusion.pdf.d. literature shows that women from the above backgrounds (categories a, b, and c) face particular challenges at the graduate level and beyond in scientific fields. (see, e.g., from the nih: a systems approach to increasing the diversity of biomedical research workforce https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc5008902/).women have been shown to be underrepresented in doctorate-granting research institutions at senior faculty levels in most biomedical-relevant disciplines, and may also be underrepresented at other faculty levels in some scientific disciplines (see data from the national science foundation national center for science and engineering statistics: women, minorities, and persons with disabilities in science and engineering, special report available at https://www.nsf.gov/statistics/2017/nsf17310/, especially table 9-23, describing science, engineering, and health doctorate holders employed in universities and 4-year colleges, by broad occupation, sex, years since doctorate, and faculty rank).upon review of nsf data, and scientific discipline or field related data, nih encourages institutions to consider women for faculty-level, diversity-targeted programs to address faculty recruitment, appointment, retention or advancement.program objectivefor the purposes of this foa, the following definitions apply:the objective of this career enhancement award for early and mid-career investigators (k18) is to provide support for experienced scientists who wish either to expand their scientific capabilities or to change their research careers by acquiring new research knowledge or skills specific to small molecule, biologic, or device development. in addition to preparing the awardee to apply for future independent funding in areas beyond their current expertise, it is expected that this career development activity also will lead to new research collaborations that could be competitive for future nih funding; particularly projects that are focused on the development of novel therapeutics and devices for the treatment of pain, addiction, and overdose.applicants are expected to identify one or more research mentors with relevant expertise in applicant knowledge-gap areas. the mentor(s) must be established, well-qualified, and willing to support the applicant's short-term research career development experience. the candidate and the proposed mentor(s) should not currently have established, longstanding collaborations at the time of the application. candidates are expected either to establish new collaborative arrangements or to strengthen and enhance relatively new or developing collaborations on a research project.novel skills that might result from mentored career development can be from the entire translational space for small molecule, biologic, or device development, such as: assay development, high-throughput screening technology, medicinal chemistry, analytical chemistry, advanced informatics, cmc, formulation, and toxicology needs assessments, risk assessment, benchtop models, in vitro models, in vivo models, cadaver testing, biocompatibility, shelf-life/stability, sterilization, leachables/extractables, electromagnetic compatibility, quality and data management systems, phase i, ii, iii clinical trials, fda regulatory requirements, human subjects protections, and data and safety monitoring. notably, the application should describe a career development plan that will ensure a broad translational research experience, rather than focusing on one specific technical aspect of the translational process.this short-term period (up to 12 months) of mentored research experience should expand the investigator's current expertise and lead to new knowledge and skills and potential new collaborators. the research career enhancement experience may be conducted in a different department within the candidate's home institution or in a different institutional setting from the location where the candidate holds their primary appointment. the research experience proposed must have the potential to augment the candidate’s research capabilities substantially and provide new research opportunities and benefits that would not be achievable through a collaborative research grant with the mentor(s). the research career enhancement experience should be tailored to the individual needs and level of experience of the candidate. the career enhancement plan may include (1) a didactic academic enrichment plan, e.g., coursework, seminars, journal clubs, etc., and (2) a small-scale research project or hands-on participation in an ongoing development project. the research project is expected to expand the candidate's desired expertise with knowledge of translational science for small molecule, biologic, or device development. ics participating in this foa may have specific interests.nih strongly encourages researchers to discuss their interests with scientific/research contacts well in advance of submitting applications. ic-specific interests appear below:national center for advancing translational sciences (ncats)ncats intends to administer applications under this foa that meet its mission to catalyze the generation of innovative methods and technologies that will enhance the development, testing and implementation of diagnostics and therapeutics across a wide range of human diseases and conditions.national institute on aging (nia)nia encourages applications that propose translational science experiencefor researchers in the development of new knowledge and skills in novel, non-addictive pain therapies (small molecules, devices, or biologics) with relevance across a variety of addiction and/or pain conditions in the context of aging – both healthy and pathological. nia intends to administer applications under this foa that meet requirements central to nia’s mission of improving the health and well-being of older adults through research.national institute of dental and craniofacial research (nidcr)nidcr is interested in expanding investigators’ translational capabilities to meet the challenges of non-opioid small molecule, biologic, or device development to treat orofacial pain (including but not limited to temporomandibular joint pain), as well as to develop diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers to enhance assessment and risk stratification of temporomandibular disorders (tmds). treatment of tmds and associated pain remains a persistent challenge due to its complex heterogenous etiologies and often co-occurring pain conditions.national institute on drug abuse (nida)the nida provides support for experienced scientists who wish either to expand their scientific capabilities or to change their research careers by acquiring new research knowledge or skills specific to small molecule, biologic, or device development. the nida interest is the development of new knowledge and skills in novel treatments for addiction, and overdose in the ongoing opioid epidemic.national institute of neurological disorders and stroke (ninds)ninds interests include experience in the development of novel, non-addictive pain therapies (small molecules, devices, or biologics) as well as diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers that would be important in choosing patients for specific therapies. training in the development of therapies targeting the mu opioid receptor will not be supported.national cancer institute (nci)nci interests include mentored research experiences in the development of novel, non-addictive pain therapies (small molecules, devices, or biologics) in a cancer-relevant context of use and in the identification of diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers that would be important in choosing cancer patients for specific therapies.note: this funding opportunity announcement (foa) is designed specifically for applicants proposing research that does not involve leading an independent clinical trial, a clinical trial feasibility study, or an ancillary clinical trial. applicants to this foa are permitted to propose research experience in a clinical trial led by a mentor or co-mentor.nih defines a clinical trial as "a research study in which one or more human subjects are prospectively assigned to one or more interventions (which may include placebo or other control) to evaluate the effects of those interventions on health-related biomedical or behavioral outcomes." (not-od-15-015).nih not only supports trials of safety and efficacy, it also supports mechanistic exploratory studies that meet the definition of a clinical trial and are designed to explore or understand a biological or behavioral process, the pathophysiology of a disease, or the mechanism of action of an intervention. these studies may focus on basic and/or translational discovery research in healthy human subjects and in human subjects who are affected by the pathophysiology of diseases and disorders. by addressing basic questions and concepts in biology, behavior, and pathophysiology, these studies may provide insight into understanding human diseases and disorders along with potential treatments or preventive strategies. nih also supports biomarker studies that meet the definition of a clinical trial and that may provide information about physiological function, target engagement of novel therapeutics, and/or the impact of therapeutics on treatment response. nih thus supports studies that meet the definition of clinical trials (as noted above) but do not seek to establish safety, clinical efficacy, effectiveness, clinical management, and/or implementation of preventive, therapeutic, and services interventions.the following will be deemed non-responsive and will not be reviewed:see section viii. other information for award authorities and regulations.grant: a support mechanism providing money, property, or both to an eligible entity to carry out an approved project or activity.the oer glossary and the sf424 (r&r) application guide provide details on these application types.not allowed: only accepting applications that do not propose clinical trials.note: applicants may propose to gain experience in a clinical trial led by a mentor/co-mentor as part of their research career development.need help determining whether you are doing a clinical trial?the nih heal initiative intends to fund an estimate of 5 awards for fiscal year 2022. the number of
