those institutes/centers.office of dietary supplements (ods)office of research on women's health (orwh)sexual and gender minority research office (sgmro)the office of disease prevention (odp) and participating national institutes of health (nih) institutes, centers, and offices (ics) are issuing this notice of special interest (nosi) to solicit applications proposing to strengthen the evidence base for preventive screening services where the evidence is lacking, of poor quality, conflicting, or the balance of benefits and harms cannot be determined. this nosi encourages the development and use of innovative and rigorous methods and approaches to close high priority evidence gaps to elevate screening services to a level suitable for a definitive grade or recommendation. the specific research interests of participating nih ics are detailed within.background:preventive screening is a critical strategy to prevent illness before it causes symptoms or problems, and as such, can play a key role in enhancing health, lengthening life, and reducing illness and disability. however, before a screening service for any condition or exposure can be broadly recommended, it must be grounded in evidence. expert panels and committees, such as the u.s. preventive services task force (uspstf), community preventive services task force (cpstf), american academy of pediatrics (aap) bright futures initiative, and the american college of obstetricians and gynecologists’ (acog) women’s preventive services initiative rely on such evidence when issuing their recommendations. for example, the uspstf issues grade a or b recommendations for screening services when the task force determines that the available evidence suggests that the net benefit is moderate or substantial. these recommendations have healthcare coverage implications as the affordable care act requires that private insurers cover grade a and b services without patient cost sharing. while the recommendations for or against a screening service receive a grade, the uspstf issues an insufficient evidence (i) statement when the task force finds that the evidence is lacking, of poor quality, conflicting, or the balance of benefits and harms cannot be ascertained, thus precluding a recommendation for or against provision of the service. to address these shortcomings in evidence, the uspstf identifies specific research needs and gaps for each i statement that, if addressed, may provide the basis for a definitive recommendation (see the uspstf 11th annual report to congress for examples of uspstf-identified high priority screening research needs/gaps). yet, inadequate research methods and approaches have been identified as a significant limitation to advancing screening i statements and their equivalent to definitive recommendations. to this end, a recent nih workshop entitled “methods for assessing the impact of screening in childhood on health outcomes” highlighted the pressing need to stimulate methodologic innovation to close screening-related evidence gaps.research objectives:this nosi encourages translational research aimed at filling identified knowledge gaps to expand the evidence base for evaluating the balance of benefits and harms for proposed preventive screenings. this includes efficacy, effectiveness, mechanistic, and longitudinal studies, cost effectiveness analyses, as well as research on novel methods, measurements, study designs, analyses, theoretical frameworks, and tools that can generate the research needed to close screening-related evidence gaps. this also includes conceptualizing and validating measures for novel health outcomes to capture the impact of screening, encompassing not just reductions in disease and disability, but also effects on quality of life and subjective well-being. applicants interested in research involving multilevel interventions to improve the uptake of recommended screening services and/or address barriers to screening are directed to the companion nosi (not-od-22-106).at minimum, the proposed study must:research within scope of this opportunity includes, but is not limited to, studies of:populations of particular interest include, but are not limited to:feasibility and pilot research studies are encouraged, as well as efficacy and effectiveness studies of new, adapted, or tailored interventions.researchers are highly encouraged to use the phenx toolkit to maximize comparisons across datasets or studies and facilitate data integration and collaboration.investigators should carefully review the specific research interests of nih ics that are participating in this nosi.ic specific application and submission information:nih ics have separately advanced funding opportunity announcements (foas) relevant to this nosi. these foas might be specific to each ic mission area. applicants must select the ic and associated foa to use for submission of an application in response to the nosi. the selection must align with the ic requirements listed in order to be considered responsive to that foa. non-responsive applications will be withdrawn from consideration for this initiative.national institute on aging (nia)the national institute on aging encourages experimental, observational, or interventional studies focused on screening adults in midlife and at older ages where current evidence is insufficient for broad recommendations. interventions may be focused on individuals, dyads, families, communities, organizations, and/or systems. nia is especially interested in intervention research that aligns with the alzheimer's disease-related dementias (ad/adrd) research implementation milestones (https://www.nia.nih.gov/research/milestones).areas of interest include, but are not limited to:measures and methods appropriate for longitudinal studies that examine the impact of screeningnia is especially interested in receiving applications for preliminary (stage i, ii, and iii) behavioral intervention development in the nih stage model for behavioral intervention development for mid-life and older individuals that capitalizes on and integrates basic research to inform the development of efficacious interventions, in accordance with the nih stage model. information about the nih stage model and behavioral intervention development can be found at: https://www.nia.nih.gov/research/dbsr/stage-model-behavioral-intervention-development.national institute on alcohol abuse and alcoholism (niaaa)niaaa supports alcohol-related biomedical and behavioral research in a wide range of scientific areas to generate and disseminate fundamental knowledge about the effects of alcohol on health and well-being, and apply that knowledge to improve diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of alcohol-related problems across the lifespan.for this nosi, niaaa is interested in innovative and rigorous research that addresses screening-related evidence gaps relevant to the niaaa mission and research priorities outlined in the niaaa strategic plan.increasing rates of alcohol misuse and alcohol use disorder (aud) among some population groups, including women, older adults, and sexual and gender minority populations, along with limited utilization of alcohol screening, brief intervention, and referral to treatment (sbi/sbirt) draw attention to the need to develop tools for improving and expanding the delivery of sbi/sbirt for these populations. in addition, the u.s. preventive services task force (uspstf) has indicated that more evidence is needed to determine whether screening for unhealthy alcohol use is beneficial for adolescents.areas of interest include, but are not limited to:national institute of arthritis and musculoskeletal and skin diseases (niams)the mission of the national institute of arthritis and musculoskeletal and skin diseases is to support research into the causes, treatment, and prevention of arthritis and musculoskeletal and skin diseases. clinical research areas include rheumatology, orthopaedics, dermatology, metabolic bone diseases, heritable disorders of bone and cartilage, inherited and inflammatory muscle diseases, and sports and rehabilitation medicine. in the context of this nosi, the niams is interested in research related to strengthening the evidence base for preventive screening services where the evidence is lacking, of poor quality, conflicting, or the balance of benefits and harms cannot be determined. this includes screening recommendations with an i for insufficient in areas of arthritis, skin, and musculoskeletal disorders defined by uspstf specific categories (see osteoporosis and adolescent idiopathic scoliosis). niams only accepts mechanistic clinical trials through the parent r01/r21 foas listed below (see not-ar-21-009). all other clinical trials must be submitted through one of the listed niams clinical trials foas. more information related to those can be found at https://www.niams.nih.gov/grants-funding/conducting-clinical-research/grants. applicants are encouraged to discuss potential applications with the appropriate niams program director.eunice kennedy shriver national institute of child health and human development (nichd)nichd supports research to understand human development, improve reproductive health, enhance the lives of children and adolescents, and optimize abilities for all. the institute provides an articulation of priority areas in the nichd strategic plan 2020. for this funding opportunity, nichd is interested in projects to address evidence gaps for screening recommendations relevant to its priority populations, which include:nichd is particularly interested in projects that consider context and the multiple levels of the socioecological model, including family and community. nichd’s strive initiative aims to improve equity, diversity, inclusion, and accessibility (edia) in all aspects of supported research, which includes encouragement to leverage unique insights from members of the populations of interest as research team members or in paid advisory roles.national institute on drug abuse (nida)the united states preventive services task force (uspstf) has concluded that the current evidence for screening adolescents for unhealthy drug use is insufficient and does not recommend screening in primary care for individuals under 18 years of age. there is a need for research to contribute to the evidence base on screening for unhealthy drug use and substance use disorder, prescription drug and opioid misuse, and opioid use disorder in adolescents in primary and other healthcare settings. in addition, there is a need for research on screening of adolescents in settings beyond primary care, including schools, juvenile justice, and child welfare settings, where adolescents engage in social and recreational activities, and particularly in settings that are utilized by vulnerable and at-risk populations.the uspstf identified gap areas in need of well-designed studies, includes research to evaluate:nida also encourages research to validate existing or new instruments for unhealthy drug use and substance use disorder, prescription drug and opioid misuse, and opioid use disorder in healthcare and non-healthcare settings.national institute on deafness and other communication disorders (nidcd)the national institute on deafness and other communication disorders (nidcd) welcomes applications focused on normal and disordered communication processes, including diseases or conditions affecting hearing, balance, taste, smell, voice, speech, and language. populations of interest include both pediatric and adult. for this initiative, applications focused on screening and early identification of differences and disorders related to nidcd mission areas are highly desirable. applicants are strongly encouraged to learn more about nidcd research areas at https://www.nidcd.nih.gov/research/extramural.ares of interest include, but are not limited to:national institute of dental and craniofacial research (nidcr)the dental office is a primary care setting that provides an opportunity for oral health practitioners to conduct preventive general and oral health services, such as evidence-based screenings. ?many individuals in the u.s. may have a dental visit in a given year, but not a routine medical visit, or they may not be aware of the need to be screened for certain medical conditions throughout the lifespan. health screenings in dental offices provide opportunities to identify individuals with undiagnosed or progressing medical conditions, beyond those conditions specific to the head and neck region. previous research indicates acceptability of screening for medical conditions in a dental setting by both dental professionals and patients. additionally, several studies have demonstrated the feasibility of conducting evidence-based screenings in the dental setting for certain medical conditions occurring throughout the lifespan.preventive oral health services delivered in settings outside the dental office (medical settings, community, etc.) may improve health equity and reduce the prevalence and incidence of oral conditions, such as dental caries.nidcr encourages research focused on strengthening the evidence that supports sustainable screening by oral health professionals in a dental setting and appropriate follow-up (treatment or referral) for medical conditions and risk behaviors that have yet to receive a definitive grade or recommendation from organizations issuing evidence-based recommendations and include a measurable health outcome. examples of conditions suitable for screening include, but are not limited to oral cancer, prediabetes, type 2 diabetes or high blood pressure in children and adolescents, depression in children and adolescents, tobacco cessation, unhealthy drug use in adolescents, child maltreatment, intimate partner violence/elder abuse/abuse of vulnerable adults, suicide risk, cognitive impairment, eating disorders, celiac disease, obstructive sleep apnea.further, nidcr encourages research focused on strengthening the evidence on preventive oral health services in settings outside the dental office, such as screening for dental caries in children younger than 5 years by primary care physicians. the complete list of conditions with uspstf evidence grade i is updated periodically, and investigators are encouraged to review the most up-to-date listing. investigators may also consider interventions that are related to screening activities recommended in the american academy of pediatrics (aap) bright futures guidelines, or by the community preventive services task force (cpstf), which are relevant to nidcr’s mission.examples of relevant study designs would include efficacy, effectiveness, validation, and longitudinal studies, cost-effectiveness analyses or novel approaches to screening. areas of interest include, but are not limited to, studies that:national institute on mental health (nimh)the national institute of mental health (nimh) is interested in research that addresses evidence gaps in screening for mental health conditions and autism spectrum disorder (asd) that have received an insufficient (i) statement from the uspstf, topics that are under review by the uspstf or in the process of being updated, and gap areas identified by other professional organizations (e.g., american college of surgeons committee on trauma or american academy of pediatrics).research is needed to strengthen the evidence-base for screening where evidence is lacking, and where the balance of benefits and harms of screening cannot be determined. for mental health conditions and autism screening, studies are needed to bridge these gaps, including potential harms described in the uspstf (2015) procedures manual: psychological harms (i.e., invasiveness of a diagnostic screening), false-positive or false-negative results, opportunity costs (increased demand on healthcare services), and overdiagnosis (diagnosis that is correct yet confers no benefit). nimh also encourages investigators to develop and leverage strong research-practice partnerships with public and private stakeholders, so that the research follows a deployment-focused model.areas of interest include research aimed at filling the knowledge gaps that expand the evidence base for evaluating the balance of benefits and harms of screening for any of these topics: (1) major depressive disorders in children aged 11 years or younger; (2) screening for depression, anxiety, and suicide risk in children, adolescents and adults, including pregnant and postpartum women; (3) suicide risk in adolescents, adults, and older adults in primary care; (4) eating disorders in adolescents and adults; and (5) autism spectrum disorder (asd) in young children for whom no concerns of asd have been raised by their parents or a clinician.examples of research encouraged by this nosi include, but are not limited to, studies that focus on:for clinical trial research on the effectiveness of implementation strategies, nimh requires a study design using an experimental therapeutics approach, in which clinical trials test intervention effects on mental health outcomes as well as elucidate the intervention’s mechanism(s) of action. in the case of implementation studies, targets/mechanisms might involve change in organizational/system-level factors to improve the adoption and sustained implementation of screening, and the fidelity and equity with which screening and related services are implemented. see the support for clinical trials at nimh web page for additional information and contact nimh program staff in advance of applying for information about nimh clinical trials practices and priorities. nimh does not accept clinical trials in response to the clinical trial parent announcements (pa-20-183; pa-20-184; pa-20-194; pa-20-195; or pa-20-196). national institute on minority health and health disparities (nimhd)nimhd is interested in projects that address screening disparities for conditions that are more prevalent in populations experiencing health disparities. populations with health disparities include african americans/blacks, hispanics/latinos, american indians/alaska natives, asians, native hawaiians and pacific islanders, socioeconomically disadvantaged populations, underserved rural populations, and sexual and gender minorities. projects are encouraged that encompass innovative methods and approaches in multiple domains (e.g., biological, behavioral, socio-cultural, environmental, physical environment, healthcare system) and multiple levels (e.g., individual, interpersonal, community, societal) to evaluate potential impact and effectiveness of screening practices in these populations (see the nimhd research framework, https://www.nimhd.nih.gov/about/overview/research-framework.html). examples of potential topic areas include but are not limited to:national institute of neurological disorders and stroke (ninds)the ninds is interested in mission relevant applications. the ninds supports basic, clinical, translational, and implementation research focused on identifying, monitoring, and targeting biological, environmental, social, community, structural, and healthcare system factors that lead to or are associated disparities (or inequities) in neurological diseases and care across the lifespan. some priority disease areas include stroke and other cerebrovascular diseases, alzheimer’s disease-related dementias (including frontotemporal neurodegeneration, lewy body dementias, vascular contributions to cognitive impairment and dementia and mixed etiology dementia), epilepsy, migraine, nervous system infections, spinal cord injury, headache, parkinson's disease, and other neurodegenerative disorders, brain trauma, neurodevelopmental disorders, and the neurological consequences of hiv/aids. applicants are encouraged to incorporate community engagement strategies into their study designs. a letter of intent and communication with ninds program staff prior to submission of an application is strongly encouraged. national institute of nursing research (ninr)the national institute of nursing research (ninr) supports research that advances the prevention, detection, and management of disease and disability for individuals and populations and informs practice and policy across clinical and community settings. drawing on nursing’s holistic, contextualized perspective, ninr funds observational, intervention, and implementation research that integrates factors at multiple levels, including social determinants of health, to identify their role in health, health improvement, and health equity across many settings, including homes, schools, workplaces, clinics, justice settings, and the community.office of disease prevention (odp)the odp is interested in research that close screening-related evidence gaps using (but not limited to) innovative methods and approaches that are relevant to the mission and research priorities outlined in the odp strategic plan. studies that involve the development of innovative methods and measures to close evidence gaps in screening are also encouraged. furthermore, the odp encourages applications that include projects seeking to develop and/or test preventive interventions. the odp offers co-funding support for research that has strong implications for disease and injury prevention, advances health equity, and that includes innovative and appropriate research design, measurement, and analysis methods. information on resources for designing studies using the best available methods is available at: https://researchmethodsresources.nih.gov/. odp does not award grants. please contact one of the ic program contacts listed for questions related to funding.office of dietary supplements (ods)the ods supports research that strengthens the knowledge and understanding of dietary supplement use in the u.s. population. the ods is interested in providing co-funding support for research on the role of dietary supplements in the prevention of disease and the maintenance of health. dietary supplement ingredients are defined as including vitamins, minerals, herbs and other botanicals, amino acids, and other dietary or bioactive substances, consumed as dietary supplements to promote health and prevent disease. for this nosi, ods is interested in research that addresses the evidence gaps in the balance of benefits and harms of screening for vitamin and mineral deficiencies among vulnerable groups, such as pregnant women, children, older adults, and asymptomatic adults at risk. this research should include the use of data-driven screening tools, including nutritional status, diet, and dietary supplement assessment tools, to identify risk factors for disease, disability, reduced quality of life, and subjective well-being. ods does not award grants. please contact one of the ic program contacts listed for questions related to funding.application and submission informationthis nosi applies to due dates on or after june 15, 2022, and
