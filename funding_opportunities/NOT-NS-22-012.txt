clinical trial not allowed). the nih has a strong interest in the diversity of the nih-funded workforce (see not-od-20-031) and encourages institutions to prioritize inclusion by supporting the the participation of individuals from groups identified as underrepresented in the biomedical, clinical, behavioral, and social sciences.the brain initiative is firmly committed to fostering diversity and inclusivity in the research community. brain investigators should strive to compose teams richly diverse in perspectives, backgrounds, and academic disciplines, and provide full opportunity and participation to individuals and groups underrepresented in neuroscience (see brain 2025 report, brain initiative 2.0 report, and brain initiative and neuroethics report). relatedly, the recruitment of diverse research participants and the inclusion of community perspectives ensures that research questions are informed by patient and family perspectives and that the benefits of research have wide applicability.the foundational brain 2025 report states that "the brain initiative should be a catalyst that will drive outstanding trainees to enter this area at their most creative career stage." the nih diversity supplement offers an opportunity for brain awardees to request additional funds to train and mentor the next generation of researchers, including those from underrepresented groups, who will contribute to advancing the goals of the brain initiative.the program also aligns and bridges to the plan for enhancing diverse perspectives (pedp) for brain initiative research programs. program directors/principal investigators (pds/pis) of active brain initiative research program grants are encouraged to identify eligible individuals across the career development pipeline (from high school students to the faculty level) for support and scientific mentorship under the auspices of this administrative supplement. the research activities proposed in the supplement application must fall within the scope of the parent grant. proposed career development activities should be appropriate for the career stage of the supplement candidate and should demonstrate both a strong commitment by the mentor and a clear path forward for the candidate. all applications must include a signed statement from an institutional official establishing eligibility of the candidate for the program, including information about citizenship of the candidate, and a description of how the candidate would further the goals of the program, consistent with not-od-20-031, "notice of nih's interest in diversity". brain initiative pd/pis are strongly encouraged to incorporate training activities that will help prepare the supplement candidate to conduct research relevant to the goals of the brain initiative 2025 report. the brain initiative encourages the research community to broadly consider how diverse perspectives advance the proposed specific aims and are integral to equity and inclusion in the science being performed.before submitting an application, applicants are strongly encouraged to consult with the program official for the parent grant or the contact listed below to confirm eligibility and to obtain technical assistance.description of circumstances for which administrative supplements are available.application and submission informationapplications for this initiative must be submitted using the following opportunity or its subsequent reissued equivalent.all instructions in the sf424 (r&r) application guide and pa-21-071 must be followed, with the following additions:please direct all inquiries to:michelle jones-london, ph.d. national institute of neurological disorders and stroke (ninds) email: braindiversitysupp@ninds.nih.govweekly toc for this announcement nih funding opportunities and noticesnote: for help accessing pdf, rtf, ms word, excel, powerpoint, audio or video files, see help downloading files.
