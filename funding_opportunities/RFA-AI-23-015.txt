will support gcids to advance the development and use of innovative genomic and bioinformatics tools with an emphasis on human pathogens and their interactions with the host and microbiome, and to rapidly respond to emerging needs, especially during disease outbreaks. the gcid program will address basic, translational, and clinically relevant questions in host-pathogen interactions and support the development of genomics-based tools to diagnose, prevent, and treat infectious diseases. in the event of an infectious disease outbreak, the gcids will be poised to leverage the expertise and resources within the network to assist in a coordinated research response.high-throughput genomic and transcriptomic sequencing is frequently used to answer infectious disease questions. for example, genomic sequencing enabled sars-cov-2 diagnosis and viral variant detection, and millions of viral genome sequences have been generated and shared publicly during the pandemic. sequencing was instrumental to advancing our knowledge about sars-cov-2 evolution, the development of drug resistance, antibody evasion, and viral transmission during localized outbreaks. sequencing is also critical for the diagnosis and management of infections, including those caused by antimicrobial-resistant bacteria, fungi, and parasites. it further advances our understanding of pathogen biology, pathogenesis, and interactions with the host, including the microbiome.the niaid gcid program was established in 2004 to apply and promote genomics to address important scientific questions and knowledge gaps in infectious diseases, to increase the number of pathogen genome sequences and gold standards in public databases, and to develop and advance the necessary tools for genomic data analysis. since then, the gcid program has made key contributions to technological advances, including the development of improved laboratory protocols, tools, and platforms to effectively process challenging samples. the gcids have also been developers and early adopters of novel and emerging approaches, including synthetic biology, microbiome analyses, metagenomics, crispr-based approaches, and cloud computing. in addition to technology development, the gcid program has a long history of supporting niaid's priority pathogen research and emergency responses, including those to anthrax, influenza, zika and ebola virus, and sars-cov-2, among others. the gcid are arranged into scientific projects that focus on different pathogens groups (i.e., viruses, bacteria, fungi, and parasites, with the inclusion of their vectors, as applicable) that are supported by a technology and data core to drive innovation in genomics across domains and to ensure rapid sharing of high-quality data. current projects supported by the gcid program are listed at https://www.niaid.nih.gov/research/genomic-centers-infectious-diseases.although substantial progress in sequencing technologies has resulted in routine use of sequencing in many research, clinical, and public health settings, significant obstacles in both clinical and research settings continue to hinder the broad use of large scale genomics for all infectious diseases, including in the areas of diagnostics, therapeutics, microbial-host interactions, and functional genomics. these obstacles include but are not limited to (1) the still relatively high cost of end-to-end workflows from sample isolation to receiving actionable results, (2) the requirement of expert personnel to perform multi-step laboratory and data analysis workflows, and (3) technological and bioinformatic challenges that limit fast and high-throughput sample processing, data analysis and integration, and the sharing of the large amounts of generated and complex data.this renewal builds on the gcid program’s rich history and will continue to apply innovative and large-scale genomics technologies and bioinformatics analysis tools to address these challenges. such efforts will provide state-of-the art technologies and advance our understanding of key areas in infectious diseases, including for epidemic and pandemic threats and emerging pathogens. the renewed program will also continue to support niaid's efforts to understand and respond to high-priority, emerging and continuing infectious disease threats.research objectives and scopethe purpose of the gcid program is to devise genome-scale methods to develop cutting-edge technologies and critical computational tools; develop methods and protocols to successfully use high-throughput sequencing and genomic technologies to study infectious diseases including host-pathogen-microbiome interactions; and advance genomics in clinical and basic research for different pathogens, including those with more complex genomes, and emerging pathogens during epidemic and pandemic disease outbreaks.it is expected that embedded in an overall theme, gcid research approaches will develop, use, and improve high-throughput sequencing and related genomic technologies such as transcriptomics and metagenomics of microorganisms, vectors and hosts, and host microbiomes to address knowledge gaps. the approaches should be innovative and provide rapid and cost-efficient production of high-quality sequences. it is further expected that projects will incorporate emerging genomic technologies into all areas of the program. the scope of the research is both basic and translational, and the use of clinical samples already at hand or retrieved through collaborations is encouraged.overall themes and research areas could include, but are not limited to:applications including the following types of studies will be considered non-responsive and will not be reviewed:pathogens: scientific projects can address a wide variety of pathogens and are encouraged to include microorganisms from niaid’s list of emerging infectious diseases and niaid’s recently identified prototype pathogens. projects should propose sequencing of multiple strains and/or isolates of specific species, populations, and/or communities rather than sequencing of individual microorganisms or vectors.pandemics, epidemics, and outbreak responses: it is expected that the gcids will continue to support epidemic and pandemic infectious disease outbreak responses and emerging infectious diseases by leveraging available expertise and resources. this can be accomplished through emergency response or collaborative pilot projects, as outlined under the administrative core and research projects.data and resource sharing: a primary objective of the gcid program is to stimulate rapid progress in infectious disease genomics, with data and resource sharing being an essential part of this process. niaid expects that all products and data of the gcid program will become available to the community throughout the duration of the award to enhance reproducibility of research results and secondary use, as appropriate and consistent with achieving the goals of the gcid program.scientific and fiscal flexibility (for emergency responses only): for emergency responses, a gcid has the authority to re-prioritize and re-allocate some resources/funds according to gcid operating policies and procedures proposed in the application and in consultation with niaid, as long as these changes are within the scope of the award's scientific priorities and the structure and minimum number of components of the gcid are maintained.the program shall consist of an administrative core; 4 research projects each addressing a different pathogen group (viruses, bacteria, fungi, and parasites, including their vectors, as applicable); one technology and data core, and up to 1 optional scientific core. the technology and data core shall support all research projects. applications that do not have the required components are considered incomplete and will be withdrawn.administrative core: each gcid must include an administrative core, headed by the contact pd/pi, that will be responsible for center activities, including but not limited to: supervising, managing, coordinating, and monitoring center progress, activities, milestones and timelines; overseeing the project management and staffing plan, including scientific and fiscal flexibility considerations; overseeing the data management and sharing plan; administering and overseeing collaborative pilot and emergency response projects and the implementation of the plan for enhancing diverse perspectives; and communicating with niaid staff.collaborative pilot projects (cpps): this foa supports collaborative pilot projects for small-scale studies in areas of shared scientific or technological interest between the funded gcids, and of benefit to the broader scientific community. the projects will be identified by the administrative core with input from the administrative core leader and with niaid consultation.emergency response projects (erps): this foa supports emergency response projects to develop critical genomics-based technological tools, methods, and studies that advance our understanding of pathogens during pandemic and epidemic outbreaks. similar to the cpps, the projects will be identified by the administrative core and its leaders, with niaid consultation.plan for enhancing diverse perspectives (pedp): this initiative requires a plan for enhancing diverse perspectives submitted as attachment (see section iv). the administrative core will oversee and ensure implementation of the center's pedp.technology and data core: each gcid must include a single technology and data core. the core will support research and development to offer innovative genomic and data technologies as a shared resource to all research projects. the core synergizes with the research projects to 1) develop innovative genome and related sequencing technologies and approaches, including large-scale high-throughput sequencing, transcriptomics and metagenomics; 2) provide data analysis and management capabilities and support, including innovative bioinformatics, computational and data visualization and integration approaches; and 3) efficiently and rapidly disseminate generated data, analysis tools, reagents, and other resources generated to the broader scientific community via open-domain repositories and knowledgebases in adherence to the requirements and timelines described in the nih guidelines (https://sharing.nih.gov/).optional scientific core: each gcid may include a maximum of 1 optional scientific core to support resources and/or facilities that are essential for the activities of two or more research projects, but inclusion of scientific cores is not required. optional cores must be well justified and provide support to at least 2 research projects.research projects: each application must propose 4 research projects, each addressing a different human pathogen group centered around the theme of viruses, bacteria, fungi, and parasites and vectors. applicants are encouraged to incorporate pathogens in the niaid priority pathogens list and prototype pathogens, as well as microbiome analysis where appropriate and relevant. research projects are expected to incorporate state-of-the-art technologies and approaches and use a combination of genomic sequencing, functional genomics, and bioinformatics analyses to understand infectious diseases. it is further expected that during pathogen outbreaks, the relevant research project is prepared to undertake emergency response projects to support niaid's infectious disease response and to advance knowledge about emerging pathogens.programmatic meetings and annual site visitsan initial program kick-off and annual programmatic meetings will be held to establish the major roles and function of the program and to facilitate communication and collaboration among funded gcids. the annual meetings will report progress, seek new research directions and ideas, provide opportunity for collaboration, and update niaid on issues of need. the meetings will be virtual (in years 2, 4, and 5) and in-person (in year 3 in rockville, md), and the meeting organization is expected to rotate between each of the gcids. niaid will organize the kick-off and year 3 meetings.annual site visits will be used by niaid program staff to review and discuss progress; problems and obstacles and approaches to overcoming identified problems and obstacles; recommendations for modifications in project timelines, objectives, and research approaches/methodologies based on outcomes to date; and future plans.plan for enhancing diverse perspectives (pedp)this foa requires a plan for enhancing diverse perspectives (pedp) as part of the application (see further below). applicants are strongly encouraged to read the foa instructions carefully and view the available pedp guidance material. applications must include a plan for enhancing diverse perspectives (pedp) submitted as other project information as an attachment (see section iv). the pedp will be assessed as part of the scientific and technical peer review evaluation, as well as considered among programmatic matters with respect to funding decisions.the gcid program aims to continue to contribute to the training and development of the next generation of scientists and future leaders in the areas of pathogen genomics, technological development, and bioinformatics to enhance infectious disease and host-pathogen research. as such, the pedp should also extend to any proposed training goals of the gcid.see section viii. other information for award authorities and regulations.cooperative agreement: a support mechanism used

defense authorization act of fiscal year 2009 (public law 110-417), nih awards will be subject to the federal awardee performance and integrity information system (fapiis) requirements. fapiis requires federal award making officials to review and consider information about an applicant in the designated integrity and performance system (currently fapiis) prior to making an award. an applicant, at its option, may review information in the designated integrity and performance systems accessible through fapiis and comment on any information about itself that a federal agency previously entered and is currently in fapiis. the federal awarding agency will consider any comments by the applicant, in addition to other information in fapiis, in making a judgement about the applicant’s integrity, business ethics, and record of performance under federal awards when completing the review of risk posed by applicants as described in 45 cfr part 75.205 and 2 cfr part 200.206 “federal awarding agency review of risk posed by applicants.” this provision will apply to all nih grants and cooperative agreements except fellowships.”the following special terms of award are in addition to, and not in lieu of, otherwise applicable u.s. office of management and budget (omb) administrative guidelines, u.s. department of health and human services (dhhs) grant administration regulations at 45 cfr part 75 and 2 cfr part 200, and other dhhs, phs, and nih grant administration policies. the administrative and funding instrument used for this program will be the cooperative agreement, an "assistance" mechanism (rather than an "acquisition" mechanism), in which substantial nih programmatic involvement with the recipients is anticipated during the performance of the activities. under the cooperative agreement, the nih purpose is to support and stimulate the recipients' activities by involvement in and otherwise working jointly with the recipients in a partnership role; it is not to assume direction, prime responsibility, or a dominant role in the activities. consistent with this concept, the dominant role and prime responsibility resides with the recipients for the project as a whole, although specific tasks and activities may be shared among the recipients and the nih as defined below.the pd(s)/pi(s) will have the primary responsibility for:program generated data, software and other resourcesrecipients will retain custody of and have primary rights to the data and software developed under these awards, subject to government rights of access consistent with current dhhs, phs, and nih policies.program-generated data and software include, for example:nih staff have substantial programmatic involvement that is above and beyond the normal stewardship role in awards, as described below:additionally, a niaid program director will be responsible for the normal scientific and programmatic stewardship of the award and will be named in the award notice.areas of joint responsibility include:the niaid project scientist will provide overall coordination across all funded gcids, will coordinate with the pd(s)/pi(s), and will hold regular gcid program-wide discussions to facilitate the achievement of gcid program goals. in the event that some members of the gcid program develop common research interests working groups may be formed to pursue collaborative activities.in addition, pd(s)/pi(s), research project and core leaders and the niaid project scientist will discuss potential projects to be funded through the collaborative pilot and emergency response project program.bimonthly teleconferencesthese teleconferences will be held to discuss progress, problems, proposed solutions and any matter that is relevant to the scientific and financial administration of the center and future activities. the schedule for those meetings will be established by the pd(s)/pi(s) and the niaid project scientist.dispute resolution:any disagreements that may arise in scientific or programmatic matters (within the scope of the award) between recipients and the nih may be brought to dispute resolution. a dispute resolution panel composed of three members will be convened. it will have three members: a designee of the steering committee chosen without nih staff voting, one nih designee, and a third designee with expertise in the relevant area who is chosen by the other two; in the case of individual disagreement, the first member may be chosen by the individual recipient. this special dispute resolution procedure does not alter the recipient's right to appeal an adverse action that is otherwise appealable in accordance with phs regulation 42 cfr part 50, subpart d and dhhs regulation 45 cfr part 16.3. data management and sharingnote: the nih policy for data management and sharing is effective for due dates on or after january 25, 2023.consistent with the nih policy for data management and sharing, when data management and sharing is applicable to the award, recipients will be required to adhere to the data management and sharing requirements as outlined in the nih grants policy statement. upon the
