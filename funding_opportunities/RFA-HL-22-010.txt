program is to help ensure that a diverse pool of highly trained scientists is available in appropriate scientific disciplines to address the nation's biomedical, behavioral, and clinical research needs. nih institutes and centers (ics) support a variety of mentored and non-mentored career development award programs designed to foster the transition of new investigators to research independence and to support established investigators in achieving specific objectives. candidates should review the different career development (k) award programs to determine the best program to support their goals. more information about career programs may be found at the nih extramural training mechanisms website.the objective of the nih mentored research scientist development award (k01) is to provide salary and research support for a sustained period of “protected time” (3-5 years) for intensive research career development, under the guidance of an experienced mentor, or sponsor in the biomedical, behavioral or clinical sciences leading to research independence. the expectation is that, through this sustained period of research career development and training, awardees will launch independent research careers and become competitive for new research project grant (e.g., r01) funding.purposethe nih recognizes a unique and compelling need to promote diversity in the biomedical, behavioral, clinical and social sciences workforce. the nih expects efforts to diversify the workforce to lead to the recruitment of the most talented researchers from all groups; to improve the quality of the educational and training environment; to balance and broaden the perspective in setting research priorities; to improve the ability to recruit subjects from minority and other health disparity populations into clinical research protocols; and to improve the nation's capacity to address and eliminate health disparities. for more information, see notice of nih's interest in diversity, not-od-20-131.this program provides research development opportunities for non-tenured science faculty from diverse backgrounds, including those from underrepresented groups. the research development program of the candidate should be based on the candidate's scholastic background, previous research experience, past achievements, and potential to develop into an independent research investigator.scientists and physicians with some research experience who need guided course work and supervised laboratory experiences, as well as faculty who need an intensive research experience under the guidance of an established scientist, are eligible to apply.backgroundalthough the nih currently provides opportunities to develop research careers and improve participation for individuals from diverse backgrounds, including those from nationally underrepresented groups with low participation in the biomedical and behavioral sciences, a report from the national science foundation (nsf) (see http://www.nsf.gov/statistics/wmpd/) provides strong evidence that diversity remains an important problem that the entire research enterprise must actively address. there is abundant evidence that the biomedical and educational enterprise will directly benefit from broader participation. recent studies have supported the argument that diversity enhances the quality of education in multiple settings. surveys have revealed that a diverse faculty is important to attract students from diverse backgrounds, including those underrepresented in the biomedical sciences, and has a positive impact on retention and career mentoring for these students. moreover, a diverse faculty can significantly contribute to a balanced research agenda. thus, a diverse research and teaching workforce provides a valuable and more comprehensive educational experience for all faculty and students.promoting the participation of faculty from diverse backgrounds, including those from underrepresented groups, is one means of preparing emerging nih-funded scientific talent for an increasingly diverse workforce and society. a diverse faculty is critically important in all institutions and can play a significant role in scientific discoveries and strengthening the institutional science infrastructure as a myriad of ideas are brought forth through discourse, thought, and theory, as well as in the different cultures and backgrounds of faculty, staff, and students. in 2017, only 3.9 percent of science and engineering (s&e) and health doctorate holders employed by universities and 4-year colleges were african american, and approximately 4.8 percent were hispanic. (see data at https://ncses.nsf.gov/pubs/nsf19304/data).in 2010, the bureau of the census reported that nearly 20 percent of the united states population had a disability. the nsf reported that in 2016 that 19 percent of undergraduate college students had a disability, and reported in 2017 that 7.8 percent of all science and engineering (s&e) doctoral degree recipients were persons with a disability (https://ncses.nsf.gov/pubs/nsf19304/data).the national center for education statistics (nces) reported that in 2012, 11 percent of college students had a disability, and 34 percent of undergraduates with disabilities were from underrepresented racial and ethnic groups. the nsf also reported in 2017 that 7.8 percent of all science and engineering (s&e) doctoral degree recipients were persons with a disability. (see data at https://www.nsf.gov/statistics/2017/nsf17310/).protected time for intensive, supervised career development experiences is critical to encourage underrepresented student populations to pursue biomedical careers, given the substantial need for physicians, physician scientists, and others who will be involved in the care of minority and other health disparity populations.nhlbi's research agenda and focusnhlbi encourages research training and career development crossing disciplinary boundaries (e.g., biophysics, biostatistics, bioinformatics, bioengineering, systems science, and big data science) to develop a new interdisciplinary work force. also of interest to nhlbi are training and career development efforts that focus on implementation research which recognize the numerous knowledge and practice gaps that impede evidence-based interventions from producing optimal health outcomes.the research proposed must be directly responsive to the mission of the nhlbi. the nhlbi does not support projects primarily focused on malignancy-related research. studies that address a mechanistic correlation between cancer (i.e., lung cancer) and primary pulmonary diseases may be considered within the mission of the nhlbi. applications on vaccine development will be considered nonresponsive for this foa. applications on respiratory pathogens will be considered within nhlbi's intent for this foa if studies focus on the host immune response. other potential overlapping areas of interest shared by the nhlbi and other institutes/centers of the nih include myeloproliferative and myelodysplastic disorders, hematological malignancies resulting from disruptions in hematopoiesis, and the use of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and other cellular therapies. therefore, applicants are strongly encouraged to contact the nhlbi before submitting an application to determine the nhlbi programmatic appropriateness for this foa and the mission of the nhlbi.nih defines a clinical trial as "a research study in which one or more human subjects are prospectively assigned to one or more interventions (which may include placebo or other control) to evaluate the effects of those interventions on health-related biomedical or behavioral outcomes." (see not-od-15-015).nih not only supports trials of safety and efficacy, it also supports mechanistic exploratory studies that meet the definition of a clinical trial and are designed to explore or understand a biological or behavioral process, the pathophysiology of a disease, or the mechanism of action of an intervention. these studies may focus on basic and/or translational discovery research in healthy human subjects and in human subjects who are affected by the pathophysiology of diseases and disorders. by addressing basic questions and concepts in biology, behavior, and pathophysiology, these studies may provide insight into understanding human diseases and disorders along with potential treatments or preventive strategies. nih also supports biomarker studies that meet the definition of a clinical trial and that may provide information about physiological function, target engagement of novel therapeutics, and/or the impact of therapeutics on treatment response. nih thus supports studies that meet the definition of clinical trials (as noted above) but do not seek to establish safety, clinical efficacy, effectiveness, clinical management, and/or implementation of preventive, therapeutic, and services interventions.note: this foa is designed specifically for candidates proposing to serve as the lead investigator of an independent clinical trial, a clinical trial feasibility study, or a separate ancillary clinical trial, as part of their research and career development. applicants not planning an independent clinical trial, or proposing to gain research experience in a clinical trial led by another investigator, must apply to the companion foa (see rfa-hl-22-011).applications not responsive to this foathe following types of applications will be considered non-responsive to this foa and will be returned without review:see section viii. other information for award authorities and regulations.grant: a support mechanism providing money, property, or both to an eligible entity to carry out an approved project or activity.the oer glossary and the sf424 (r&r) application guide provide details on these application types.required: only accepting applications that propose an independent clinical trial(s).need help determining whether you are doing a clinical trial?nhlbi intends to commit total costs up to $48,600,000 to fund up to 60 new awards combined for this and the companion funding opportunity, rfa-hl-22-011, in fiscal years 2022, 2023, and 2024.award budgets are composed of salary and other program-related expenses, as described below. application budgets must not exceed $150,000 per year in direct costs. however, applications should reflect the actual needs of the proposed project.the total project period may not exceed 5 years.nih will contribute up to $100,000 per year toward the salary of the career award recipient. further guidance on budgeting for career development salaries is provided in the sf424 (r&r) application guide. see also not-od-17-094.the total salary requested must be based on a full-time faculty appointment. the salary must be consistent both with the established salary structure at the institution and with salaries actually provided by the institution from its own funds to other staff members of equivalent qualifications, rank, and responsibilities in the department concerned. if full-time, 12-month salaries are not currently paid to comparable staff members, the salary proposed must be appropriately related to the existing salary structure. confirmation of salary may be required prior to the issuance of an award. fringe benefits, based on the sponsoring institution's rate and the percent of effort, are provided in addition to salary.the sponsoring institution may supplement the nih salary contribution up to a level that is consistent with the institution's salary scale. however, supplementation may not be from federal funds unless specifically authorized by the federal program from which such funds are derived. in no case may phs funds be used for salary supplementation. institutional supplementation of salary must not require extra duties or responsibilities that would interfere with the purpose of the career award.the total nih contribution to salary may not exceed the legislatively mandated salary cap (see http://grants.nih.gov/grants/policy/salcap_summary.htm).nhlbi will contribute up to $30,000 per year toward the research development costs of the award recipient, which must be justified and consistent with the stage of development of the candidate and the proportion of time to be spent in research or career development activities. these funds may be used for the following expenses: (a) tuition and fees related to career development; (b) research-related expenses, such as supplies, equipment and technical personnel; c) travel to research meetings or training; and (d) statistical services including personnel and computer time. salary for mentors, secretarial and administrative assistants, etc. is not allowed.k awardee meeting: the nhlbi will hold 2-day meetings during the project period to encourage the exchange of information among the k awardees and the nhlbi program staff. the meetings may also include others on a similar career trajectory who also are preparing for independent research careers. therefore, included within the research development costs budget category, the candidate should budget for travel funds that would support attendance to at least one of the 2-day meetings during the project period, to be held in or near bethesda, md. at these meetings, k awardees will present their results, and learn about next steps in their research career.reasonable accommodations: as part of this award, funds may be requested to make changes or adjustments in the research setting that will make it possible for a qualified individual with a disability to perform the essential functions associated with his/her role on the project. the accommodations requested under this program must be directly related to the performance of the proposed role on the research project and must be appropriate to the disabilities of the individual. some types of accommodations that might be provided under this award include: specialized equipment, assistive devices, and personnel such as readers, interpreters, or assistants. in all cases, the total funds for accommodations requested must be reasonable.higher education institutionsthe following types of higher education institutions are always encouraged to apply for nih support as public or private institutions of higher education:nonprofits other than institutions of higher educationfor-profit organizationsgovernmentsapplicant organizationsapplicant organizations must complete and maintain the following registrations as described in the sf 424 (r&r) application guide to be eligible to apply for or receive an award. all registrations must be completed prior to the application being submitted. registration can take 6 weeks or more, so applicants should begin the registration process as soon as possible. the nih policy on late submission of grant applications states that failure to complete registrations in advance of a due date is not a valid reason for a late submission.program directors/principal investigators (pd(s)/pi(s))all pd(s)/pi(s) must have an era commons account. pd(s)/pi(s) should work with their organizational officials to either create a new account or to affiliate their existing account with the applicant organization in era commons. if the pd/pi is also the organizational signing official, they must have two distinct era commons accounts, one for each role. obtaining an era commons account can take up to 2 weeks.all pd(s)/pi(s) must be registered with orcid. the personal profile associated with the pd(s)/pi(s) era commons account must be linked to a valid orcid id. for more information on linking an orcid id to an era commons personal profile see the orcid topic in our era commons online help.every facet of the united states scientific research enterprise—from basic laboratory research to clinical and translational research to policy formation–requires superior intellect, creativity and a wide range of skill sets and viewpoints. nih’s ability to help ensure that the nation remains a global leader in scientific discovery and innovation is dependent upon a pool of highly talented scientists from diverse backgrounds who will help to further nih's mission. research shows that diverse teams working together and capitalizing on innovative ideas and distinct perspectives outperform homogenous teams. scientists and trainees from diverse backgrounds and life experiences bring different perspectives, creativity, and individual enterprise to address complex scientific problems. there are many benefits that flow from a diverse nih-supported scientific workforce, including: fostering scientific innovation, enhancing global competitiveness, contributing to robust learning environments, improving the quality of the research, advancing the likelihood that underserved or health disparity populations participate in, and benefit from health research, and enhancing public trust. in spite of tremendous advancements in scientific research, information, educational and research opportunities are not equally available to all. nih encourages institutions to diversify their student and faculty populations to enhance the participation of individuals from groups that are underrepresented in the biomedical, clinical, behavioral and social sciences (see not-od-20-031), such as:a. individuals from racial and ethnic groups that have been shown by the national science foundation to be underrepresented in health-related sciences on a national basis (see data at http://www.nsf.gov/statistics/showpub.cfm?topid=2&subid=27) and the report women, minorities, and persons with disabilities in science and engineering). the following racial and ethnic groups have been shown to be underrepresented in biomedical research: blacks or african americans, hispanics or latinos, american indians or alaska natives, native hawaiians and other pacific islanders. in addition, it is recognized that underrepresentation can vary from setting to setting; individuals from racial or ethnic groups that can be demonstrated convincingly to be underrepresented by the grantee institution should be encouraged to participate in nih programs to enhance diversity. for more information on racial and ethnic categories and definitions, see the omb revisions to the standards for classification of federal data on race and ethnicity (https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/fr-1997-10-30/html/97-28653.htm).b. individuals with disabilities, who are defined as those with a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities, as described in the americans with disabilities act of 1990, as amended. see nsf data at, https://www.nsf.gov/statistics/2017/nsf17310/static/data/tab7-5.pdf.c. individuals from disadvantaged backgrounds, defined as those who meet two or more of the following criteria:1. were or currently are homeless, as defined by the mckinney-vento homeless assistance act (definition: https://nche.ed.gov/mckinney-vento/);2. were or currently are in the foster care system, as defined by the administration for children and families (definition: https://www.acf.hhs.gov/cb/focus-areas/foster-care);3. were eligible for the federal free and reduced lunch program for two or more years (definition: https://www.fns.usda.gov/school-meals/income-eligibility-guidelines);4. have/had no parents or legal guardians who completed a bachelor’s degree (see https://nces.ed.gov/pubs2018/2018009.pdf);5. were or currently are eligible for federal pell grants (definition: https://www2.ed.gov/programs/fpg/eligibility.html);6. received support from the special supplemental nutrition program for women, infants and children (wic) as a parent or child (definition: https://www.fns.usda.gov/wic/wic-eligibility-requirements).7. grew up in one of the following areas: a) a u.s. rural area, as designated by the health resources and services administration (hrsa) rural health grants eligibility analyzer (https://data.hrsa.gov/tools/rural-health), or b) a centers for medicare and medicaid services-designated low-income and health professional shortage areas (qualifying zipcodes are included in the file). only one of the two possibilities in #7 can be used as a criterion for the disadvantaged background definition.students from low socioeconomic (ses) status backgrounds have been shown to obtain bachelor’s and advanced degrees at significantly lower rates than students from middle and high ses groups (see https://nces.ed.gov/programs/coe/indicator_tva.asp), and are subsequently less likely to be represented in biomedical research. for background see department of education data at, https://nces.ed.gov/; https://nces.ed.gov/programs/coe/indicator_tva.asp; https://www2.ed.gov/rschstat/research/pubs/advancing-diversity-inclusion.pdf.d. literature shows that women from the above backgrounds (categories a, b, and c) face particular challenges at the graduate level and beyond in scientific fields. (see, e.g., from the nih: a systems approach to increasing the diversity of biomedical research workforce https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc5008902/).women have been shown to be underrepresented in doctorate-granting research institutions at senior faculty levels in most biomedical-relevant disciplines, and may also be underrepresented at other faculty levels in some scientific disciplines (see data from the national science foundation national center for science and engineering statistics: women, minorities, and persons with disabilities in science and engineering, special report available at https://www.nsf.gov/statistics/2017/nsf17310/, especially table 9-23, describing science, engineering, and health doctorate holders employed in universities and 4-year colleges, by broad occupation, sex, years since doctorate, and faculty rank).upon review of nsf data, and scientific discipline or field related data, nih encourages institutions to consider women for faculty-level, diversity-targeted programs to address faculty recruitment, appointment, retention or advancement. any candidate with the skills, knowledge, and resources necessary to carry out the proposed research as the program director/principal investigator (pd/pi), including those from underrepresented groups such as the groups identified above, is invited to work with his/her mentor and organization to develop an application for support. multiple pds/pis are not allowed. by the time of award, the individual must be a citizen or a non-citizen national of the united states or have been lawfully admitted for permanent residence (i.e., possess a currently valid permanent resident card uscis form i-551, or other legal verification of such status). current and former pds/pis on nih research project (r01), program project (p01), center grants (p50), project leads of program project (p01), or center grants (p50), other major individual career development awards (e.g., k01, k07, k08, k22, k23, k25, k76, k99/r00), or the equivalent are not eligible. current and former pds/pis of an nih small grant (r03), exploratory/developmental grant (r21), planning grant (r34/u34), dissertation award (r36), or sbir/sttr (r41, r42, r43, r44) remain eligible, as do pd/pis of transition scholar (k38) awards and individuals appointed to institutional k programs (k12, kl2). this funding opportunity may support individuals who propose to train in a new field or individuals who have had a hiatus in their research career because of illness or pressing family circumstances. eligible candidates must have research experience (length of time may vary) and be committed to developing into independent biomedical investigators in research areas relevant to the mission of the nhlbi (basic, clinical, or translational area related to cardiovascular, pulmonary, or hematologic diseases and sleep disorders). candidates must demonstrate potential for a career as an independent investigator in basic, clinical, or translational research.the award will enable suitable faculty members holding doctoral degrees, such as the phd, md, do, dvm in research or health professions, or an equivalent, to undertake special study and supervised research under a mentor who is an accomplished investigator in the research area proposed, and has experience in developing independent investigators.the program is not intended to support additional graduate training and is not intended to support career changes from non-research to research careers for individuals without prior research training.candidates must hold non-tenured faculty appointments (such as instructor, or assistant professor) before the award is made. the faculty appointment must not be contingent on receipt of the award.current and former recipients of k12/kl2 support may apply for the k01 provided that they have no more than three years of k12/kl2 support by the time the k01 award is issued. the combined total of k12/kl2 plus k01 support must not exceed six years. a candidate for the k01 may not concurrently apply for or have an award pending for any other nih career development award.applicant organizations may submit more than one application, provided that each application is scientifically distinct, and each is from a different candidate.the nih will not accept duplicate or highly overlapping applications under review at the same time. an individual may not have two or more competing nih career development applications pending review concurrently. in addition, nih will not accept:at the time of award, the candidate must have a “full-time” appointment at the applicant institution. candidates are required to commit a minimum of nine person months of effort (i.e., 75% of full-time professional effort) to their program of career development during the mentored phase. candidates may engage in other duties as part of the professional effort not covered by this award, as long as such duties do not interfere with or detract from the proposed career development program.candidates who have va appointments may not consider part of the va effort toward satisfying the full time requirement at the applicant institution. candidates with va appointments should contact the staff person at nhlbi prior to preparing an application to discuss their eligibility.after the receipt of the award, adjustments to the required level of effort may be made in certain circumstances. see not-od-09-036 for more details.mentor(s) before submitting the application, the candidate must identify a mentor who will supervise the proposed career development and research experience. the mentor should be an active investigator in the area of the proposed research and be committed both to the career development of the candidate and to the direct supervision of the candidate’s research. the mentor must document the availability of sufficient research support and facilities for high-quality research. candidates are encouraged to identify more than one mentor, i.e., a mentoring team, if this is deemed advantageous for providing expert advice in all aspects of the research career development program. in such cases, one individual must be identified as the primary mentor who will coordinate the candidate’s research. the candidate must work with the mentor(s) in preparing the application. the mentor, or a member of the mentoring team, should have a successful track record of mentoring individuals at the candidate’s career stage. where
