application due dates between september 22 and september 30, 2022see section iii. 3. additional information on eligibility.the goal of the nidcr career enhancement award (k18) is to support mentored research experiences for established investigators who either wish to expand or augment their dental, oral, or craniofacial (doc) research program, or to redirect their research by incorporating doc research into their research program to advance fundamental knowledge about dental, oral, and craniofacial health and disease.this funding opportunity announcement (foa) is designed specifically for candidates proposing research that does not involve leading an independent clinical trial, a clinical trial feasibility study, or an ancillary study to a clinical trial. applicants to this foa are permitted to propose research experience in a clinical trial led by a mentor or co-mentor.not applicableall applications are due by 5:00 pm local time of applicant organization.applications are encouraged to apply early to allow adequate time to make any corrections to errors found in the application during the submission process by the due date.not applicablethere are several options available to submit your application through grants.gov to nih and department of health and human services partners. you must use one of these submission options to access the application forms for this opportunity.the overall goal of the nih research career development program is to help ensure that a diverse pool of highly trained scientists is available in appropriate scientific disciplines to address the nation's biomedical, behavioral, and clinical research needs. nih institutes and centers (ics) support a variety of mentored and non-mentored career development award programs designed to foster the transition of new investigators to research independence and to support established investigators in achieving specific objectives. candidates should review the different career development (k) award programs to determine the best program to support their goals. more information about career programs may be found at the nih research training and career development website.the objective of the career enhancement award for experienced investigators (k18) is to provide support for experienced scientists who either wish to broaden their scientific capabilities or to make changes in their research careers by acquiring new research skills or knowledge. the purpose of this foa is to provide such investigators with support for a short-term, yet intensive period of mentored research experience to acquire new research capabilities in research areas supported by the sponsoring nih institute(s)/center(s). such experiences will afford candidate investigators protected time to: 1) enrich and expand their expertise and research programs through retooling in new techniques, emerging technologies, and/or scientific areas; and/or 2) redirect their research programs in new trajectories; and/or 3) catalyze research collaborations in new research directions. it is expected that this initiative will lead to new and/or augmented research programs competitive for nih funding.the nidcr conducts and fosters research and research training on the etiology, pathogenesis, prevention, diagnosis, monitoring, and treatment of dental, oral, and craniofacial diseases and conditions. the objective of the nidcr career enhancement award in dental, oral, and craniofacial (doc) research (k18) is to provide mid-career and senior investigators with protected time for an intensive short-term mentored research experience, from 2.4 to 12 months, to facilitate their continued research career development by acquiring new knowledge and skills in state-of-the-art techniques and technologies, and in applying innovative tools and approaches to advancing doc research and discovery. candidates may be either experienced doc researchers seeking career enhancement in scientific areas outside of their current expertise, or experienced investigators in other research areas who are seeing career enhancement in doc research.the proposed career enhancement activities may be conducted in the same or different department/school within the candidate's home institution where the candidate holds a primary appointment, or at a different institution. the host mentoring laboratory/research program must have appropriate research facilities and resources to support the candidate’s research and other career enhancement activities.candidates must identify one or more mentors with extensive research experience in an appropriate domain or discipline to guide the candidate. the mentor(s) must be established and well-qualified investigators and agree to support the candidate’s short-term experience. the proposed career enhancement experience is expected to be a novel extension of the candidate’s current research program, must be tailored to the candidate, and have the potential to substantially impact the candidate’s research capabilities, and to provide new research opportunities and benefits that would not be achievable through a collaborative research grant with the mentor(s). the candidate and the proposed mentor(s) should not have an ongoing or existing collaboration at the time of the application. candidates are expected to establish new collaborations for this program. diverse multidisciplinary teams are encouraged. the candidate must justify why the proposed career enhancement plan will facilitate the goals of this nidcr k18 program in a manner that could not be achieved solely through a research grant or current collaborative arrangement.this nidcr k18 will support dental, oral, and craniofacial career enhancement experiences in in areas consistent with the research priorities of the nidcr, including the behavioral and social sciences research program, clinical research programs, translational genetics and genomics programs, and the integrative biology and infectious disease research programs.behavioral and social sciences research priorities for this foa:the nidcr behavioral and social sciences program supports both basic and applied research to promote oral health, to prevent oral/dental diseases and related disabilities, and to improve management of craniofacial conditions, disorders, and injury. mentored experiences are encouraged that facilitate the application of theories, tools, methods, or approaches from the behavioral or social sciences to oral health challenges.clinical research program priorities for this foa:the nidcr clinical research program supports research aimed at improving dental, oral and craniofacial health through clinical trials, practice-based research, epidemiologic studies, clinical technology research, studies of oral health disparities and inequities, and hiv/aids and oral health. mentored experiences are encouraged that provide clinical research experiences or develop measures, tools or methods to be used in future clinical research proposals.translational genetics and genomics research programs priorities for this foa:the nidcr translational genomics research program supports studies that identify epi/genetic, environmental, and behavioral factors and biological pathways that underlie the physiology and pathology through doc development at cellular, tissue, organ, and organismal/individual levels as well as data science projects that develop or apply data science and computational methods and resources to accelerate knowledge discovery and translation of dental, oral, and craniofacial biology to improve health or clinical efficacy. a collaborative partnership can be arranged through an investigator seeking mentorship from another investigator in a complementary area of expertise.integrative biology and infectious disease research program priorities for this foa:the nidcr integrative biology and infectious disease research program supports basic and translational research in oral microbiology; salivary gland biology; oral immunology; oral, oropharyngeal, and salivary gland cancers; orofacial pain and temporomandibular joint disorders; mineralized tissue physiology; dental materials and biomaterials; and tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. mentored experiences are encouraged that provide research experiences in these areas with new collaborations and diverse multidisciplinary teams.in addition, this nidcr k18 re-issue expands doc career enhancement experiences for investigators seeking new mentored/collaborative experiences in the following areas:all research experience must align with research priorities of nidcr grant programs, which can be found at
