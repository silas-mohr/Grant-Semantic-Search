mission of the institutes/centers. the following nih offices may co-fund applications assigned to those institutes/centers.division of program coordination, planning and strategic initiatives, office of disease prevention (odp)office of behavioral and social sciences research (obssr)office of research on women's health (orwh)the purpose of this notice of special interest (nosi) is to stimulate dissemination and implementation research to support innovative approaches to identifying, understanding, and developing strategies for overcoming barriers to the adoption, adaptation, integration, scale-up and sustainability of evidence-based preventive interventions to support children’s mental, emotional, and behavioral (meb) health in school settings. this nosi encourages applications which focus on dissemination and implementation research to deliver interventions in the school setting that will promote healthy meb development and/or prevent meb disorders. applications should include a focus on one of the following: (1) primary/universal prevention meb programs designed to promote healthy meb development by decreasing risk factors and increasing protective factors to prevent onset of an meb disorder; or (2) secondary/selective prevention programs designed to support screening and early identification of meb disorders to slow progression with early intervention. applications focused on tertiary/indicated treatment of meb disorders will be considered non-responsive to this notice.background:in 2019, the national academies of sciences, engineering, and medicine published a report, fostering healthy mental, emotional and behavioral development in children and youth. the report revealed that meb disorders (e.g., anxiety disorders, depression, substance use disorders, and/or behavior disorders) are common, emerge during childhood or adolescence, and are linked to disability, school dropout, incarceration, and homelessness, posing a major threat to healthy development. importantly, poor meb health negatively impacts academic performance, and this carries over into postsecondary education. children have limited access to services for promoting meb health and preventing meb disorders. this is particularly true for children from nih-designated health disparity populations (i.e., blacks/african americans, hispanics/latinos, american indians/alaska natives, asian americans, native hawaiians and other pacific islanders, socioeconomically disadvantaged populations, underserved rural populations, and sexual and gender minorities) and other vulnerable populations (e.g., children with disabilities, homeless youth). public schools have increasingly become key access points of meb health programs, services, and referrals for children. although efficacious evidence-based interventions aimed at preventing meb disorders exist, challenges and barriers need to be addressed to improve their adoption, integration, scale-up and sustainability. to advance health equity in meb health outcomes, local adaptations to existing interventions may be needed to promote scale-up and sustainability of interventions in ways that better meet the needs of children from health disparity and vulnerable populations.research objectives:the objectives of this nosi are to advance implementation and dissemination research of evidence-based meb programs aimed at promoting children’s mental, emotional, and behavioral health or preventing meb disorders in school settings, with a particular focus on schools that serve nih designated health disparity populations and other vulnerable populations likely to be under-resourced.topics of interest include, but are not limited to:ic specific application and submission information:applicants must select the ic and associated foa to use for submission of an application in response to the nosi. the selection must align with the ic requirements listed in order to be considered responsive to that foa. non-responsive applications will be withdrawn from consideration for this initiative.national center for complementary and integrative health (nccih)nccih supports research on the use of complementary and integrative health approaches to promote healthy meb development and prevent meb disorders. for this nosi, nccih has interests in supporting hybrid type 2 and hybrid type 3 effectiveness-implementation studies to improve the adoption, scale-up, and sustainability of interventions that incorporate the use of complementary and integrative health approaches to promote meb health and/or prevent meb disorders among children and adolescents in school settings. the complementary interventions proposed should have strong evidence of efficacy for meb health to warrant their inclusion inschool-based settings. complementary approaches of interests include those with physical and/or psychological therapeutic inputs, often called mind and body approaches (e.g., acupuncture, yoga, tai chi, qi gong, meditation, mindfulness approaches, hypnosis, music therapy, art therapy, spinal or chiropractic manipulation, and massage) as well as approaches with dietary or nutritional therapeutic inputs (e.g., special diets). integrative approaches include therapies that combine complementary approaches with conventional meb interventions such as psychological interventions, exercise, or social-emotional learning programs. a priority area for nccih is studies to improve uptake and sustainability of meb interventions to reduce health disparities and advance equity in meb health outcomes among children from health disparity and other vulnerable populations. nccih is also interested in applications that include a focus on strategies to support multicomponent approaches to address meb outcomes, academic outcomes, and physical health outcomes (e.g., sleep disturbances, obesity, physical activity) to promote whole child health. nccih will not accept efficacy or effectiveness (including type 1 hybrid designs) trials research through this nosi (instead please see nccih clinical trial funding opportunities).national institute of mental health (nimh)nimh encourages research that proposes effectiveness and implementation hybrid designs that examine core components of the meb preventive interventions and implementation strategies delivered in school settings. primary goals will identify targets and mechanisms that contribute to the effectiveness of meb preventive interventions and test implementation strategies to improve uptake, scale-up, and sustainability of effective interventions in school settings. secondary goals will examine meb outcomes (e.g., mental health, functioning, academics).nimh is interested in supporting studies on research topics listed below:for research on the effectiveness of interventions or services, nimh requires a study design using an experimental therapeutics approach, in which clinical trials test intervention effects on mental health outcomes as well as elucidate the intervention’s mechanism(s) of action. clinical trial proposals that do not adhere to the experimental therapeutics framework will be considered non-responsive to this foa. therefore, applications must specify intervention target/mechanism and assess whether intervention-induced changes in the target account for the hypothesized outcome. in the case of services interventions, targets/mechanisms might involve change in service-user, family and/or provider behavior, or in organizational/system-level factors to improve access, engagement, continuity, quality, equity, and/or value of services. studies adapting interventions for racial and ethnic minority populations (e.g., american indians/alaska natives, asian americans, blacks/african americans, hispanics/latinos, and native hawaiians and other pacific islanders), sexual and gender minorities, socioeconomically disadvantaged populations, and underserved rural populations should provide an empirical rationale for the adaptation/augmentation target and a clear hypothesis and plan to address the target mechanism by which the adapted intervention will enhance outcomes. see the support for clinical trials at nimh web page for additional information.eunice kennedy shriver national institute of child health and human development (nichd)nichd has particular interest in research on minoritized and underserved populations falling within the nichd scientific mission area, including school-aged children and adolescents (e.g., ages 5-17) with physical and/or intellectual disabilities; children who are homeless or in foster care, children who have been involved in the welfare or justice systems; and children living in disadvantaged or rural communities. dissemination and implementation research that seeks to advance the uptake, scale-up, and sustainability of multi-component programs that target multiple developmental outcomes are of high interest.additional research topics of interest to nichd that fall within the scope of this nosi include, but are not limited to, implementation and dissemination research, including effectiveness and implementation hybrid designs in low resource school settings (schools in which up to at least 40% of enrollment are eligible to use title i funds) or schools that serve nih designated health disparity populations that seeks to advance implementation of programs, practices, and policies that:national institute on minority health and health disparities (nimhd)the mission of nimhd is to lead scientific research to improve minority health and reduce health disparities. populations that experience health disparities of interest to nimhd include african americans/blacks, hispanic/latinos, american indians/alaska natives, asians, native hawaiians, and pacific islanders, socioeconomically disadvantaged populations, underserved rural populations, and sexual and gender minority populations. in the context of this foa, nimhd is especially interested in innovative multi-disciplinary and multi-level (e.g., individual, community, health care system) approaches to promote meb health among children and youth from populations affected by health disparities. (hence, underserved youth)examples of potential topic areas include but are not limited to:the office of disease prevention (odp)the office of disease prevention (odp) is the lead office at the nih responsible for assessing, facilitating, and stimulating research in disease prevention. in partnership with the 27 nih institutes and centers, the odp strives to increase the scope, quality, dissemination, and impact of nih-supported prevention research. the odp is interested in providing co-funding support for research that has strong implications for disease and injury prevention and health equity and that include innovative and appropriate research design, measurement, and analysis methods. furthermore, the odp has a specific interest in projects that develop and/or test preventive interventions. for this nosi, odp is interested in supporting research to addresses sdoh-related barriers and facilitators to implementation and sustainability of mental, emotional, and behavioral (meb) health preventive, evidence-based interventions (ebis) in school settings. ebis may come from the u.s. preventive services task force, the community preventive services task force, healthy people 2030, or from other ebi sources. for additional information about odp’s research priorities and interests, please refer to the odp strategic plan for fiscal years 2019–2023.the odp does not award grants; therefore applications must be relevant to the objectives of at least one of the participiating nih institutes and centers (ic) listed in this announcement. please contact the relevant ic scientific/research contact(s) listed for questions regarding ic research priorities and funding.office of research on women’s health (orwh)orwh is part of the office of the director of nih and works in partnership with the 27 nih institutes and centers to ensure that women's health research is part of the scientific framework at the nih and is supported in the larger scientific community. also, orwh has an interest in research focused on populations experiencing health inequities, including groups of women and girls who are understudied, underrepresented, and underreported in research. it is well-documented that children affected by poverty, neighborhood incivility and under resourced or poor-quality schools have fewer opportunities to develop the foundation for optimal mental, physical, and social health later in life. they are also at greater risk for early onset mental, emotional, and behavioral (meb) disorders, lower school achievement, and child welfare or juvenile justice system involvement, each of which threatens the health and well-being of the affected children, their families, and communities. there is strong evidence for the effectiveness of school-based interventions, particularly those that offer therapeutic activities to foster individual level behavior change alongside efforts to enhance classroom management, reduce bullying, and lessen disciplinary imbalances. in recognition of the need for the integration of effective services to promote mental, emotional and behavioral health in the educational context, and for such services to be tailored to account for the specific social and emotional needs of disadvantaged students, orwh is interested in providing support for multicomponent/multilevel interdisciplinary, behavioral, clinical, and/or translational studies exploring disparities in educational (e.g., school disciplinary practices) and meb disorders, their interaction and the implementation of complementary and integrative health strategies to promote healthy meb development. proposals seeking to intervene on multiple levels (i.e. provide specialized training for teachers and staff on accommodating students with behavioral health issues, anti-bullying interventions for the student body and school-based family interventions targeting parenting skills and in-school achievement/behavior), showing strong evidence of efficacy for meb health (e.g. mediation/mindfulness-based interventions, music-, art- and drama therapy) and incorporating intersectional analyses are of particular interest; as are those using sex and/or gender-sensitive and contextually relevant approaches. for additional guidance, please refer to the 2019-2023 trans-nih strategic plan for the health of women on the orwh website (https://www.nih.gov/women/strategicplan).the office of behavioral and social sciences research (obssr)the office of behavioral and social sciences (obssr) does not
