(foa) invites basic and/or methodological research projects that illuminate and/or measure independent and interdependent health-related effects within dyads across relationships and settings. for the purpose of this foa, a dyad is a unit of two individuals whose interactions and influences on one another are nested within larger social contexts and networks. dyads are social relationships that extend beyond the individual and have strong bidirectional influences on physical and mental health. for the purpose of this foa, independent effects are those effects that affect each member of the dyad individually (i.e., by nature of being part of the dyad), whereas interdependent effects are those that affect one member of the dyad contingent upon the other member of the dyad (i.e., not only because the individual is part of a dyad but also because being part of the dyad has an effect on the other individual within the dyad as well).not applicableall applications are due by 5:00 pm local time of applicant organization. all types of non-aids applications allowed for this funding opportunity announcement are due on the listed date(s).applicants are encouraged to apply early to allow adequate time to make any corrections to errors found in the application during the submission process by the due date.not applicableit is critical that applicants follow the instructions in the research (r) instructions in the sf424 (r&r) application guide,except where instructed to do otherwise (in this foa or in a notice from nih guide for grants and contracts ).conformance to all requirements (both in the application guide and the foa) is required and strictly enforced. applicants must read and follow all application instructions in the application guide as well as any program-specific instructions noted in section iv. when the program-specific instructions deviate from those in the application guide, follow the program-specific instructions.applications that do not comply with these instructions may be delayed or not accepted for review.there are several options available to submit your application through grants.gov to nih and department of health and human services partners. you must use one of these submission options to access the application forms for this opportunity.this funding opportunity announcement (foa) invites basic and/or methodological

also because being part of the dyad has an effect on the other individual within the dyad as well).all applications submitted through this foa must propose basic science experimental studies with humans, also referred to in not-od-21-088 as “prospective basic science studies involving human participants.” these studies meet the nih definition of basic research and also fall within the nih definition of a clinical trial. observational studies involving humans should submit under the companion clinical trials not allowed version of this foa.nih defines basic research consistent with the definition of basic research in federal code, “the systematic study directed toward greater knowledge or understanding of the fundamental aspects of phenomena and of observable facts without specific applications towards processes or products in mind” (32 cfr 272.3).nih defines a clinical trial as, "a research study in which one or more human subjects are prospectively assigned to one or more interventions (which may include placebo or other control) to evaluate the effects of those interventions on health-related biomedical or behavioral outcomes" (not-od-15-015).types of studies that should submit under this foa include studies that prospectively assign human participants to conditions (i.e., experimentally manipulate independent variables) and that assess biomedical or behavioral outcomes in humans for the purpose of understanding the fundamental aspects of phenomena without specific application towards processes or products in mind.for the purposes of this foa, “specific application towards processes or products” refers to the application of biomedical or behavioral products, procedures, or services intended to affect a health-related outcome of the individual or a group of individuals either by better understanding the mechanism of action of an intervention or a measurable improvement in health.basic experimental studies in which participants are prospectively assigned to experimental conditions and receive an experimental manipulation or intervention where the effect will be assessed for the purpose of understanding fundamental aspects of phenomena may submit under this foa.please refer to the table comparing funding opportunity types by clinical trial allowability for additional guidance on the most appropriate foa for the type of study.backgroundhumans are a social species who form, maintain, and rely upon social entities that extend beyond the individual self. such social intercourse has strong bidirectional influences on physical and mental health. this foa focuses on the dyad, a unit of two individuals whose interactions and influences on one another are nested within larger social contexts and networks.examples of dyads include and, are not limited to:research across multiple disciplines has demonstrated that dyadic relationships not only influence the health and wellbeing of people within a dyad, but also that health-related outcomes at the dyadic level can be influenced by environmental, institutional, social, and/or other structural factors over the lifecourse. nih-relevant (e.g. health relevant) factors influenced by dyadic relationships or interactions include and are not limited to, perception of risk; emotional experiences (e.g. fear); medical treatments; financial decision-making; and initiation, maintenance, and/or change in health-related behaviors.much research on dyads, behaviors, and health outcomes to date has relied on self-reported data, including data reported by a sole individual to describe both dyad members. although past studies of dyads also have used lab-based methods, including observation with behavioral coding, paradigms for controlled interaction, and/or psychophysiological measures, twentieth-century technology and resources constrained more holistic and real-world data collection. advances in current technology permit the development and collection of behavioral, environmental, interpersonal, social, and biospecimen data in myriad ways and settings to illuminate biopsychosocial processes within dyads and their longer-term implications for health and well-being.the r01 mechanism, common to all nih icos participating in this foa, was chosen expressly to empower investigators to propose innovative scopes of work with correspondingly appropriate budgets. regardless of the number of project-years proposed, investigators should budget each year for travel to an annual meeting of grantees on or near the nih campus in bethesda, md, to share research methods and findings. awardees will be encouraged to work together on some shared scientific opportunities at the annual meeting and across the award period.this funding opportunity invites basic and/or methodological research projects that measure and illuminate independent and interdependent effects within dyads across types of relationships and settings. research projects between 2-5 years with correspondingly resourced budgets are recommended for submission. proposed research projects are expected to address at least one of two broad research questions:about oppnetoppnet is a trans-nih initiative that funds research activities that build the collective body of knowledge on the nature of behaviors and social systems and deepen our understanding of basic social-behavioral mechanisms and processes. all oppnet initiatives invite investigators to propose research projects that will advance basic social and behavioral sciences and produce knowledge and/or tools with potential relevance to multiple domains of health research. all nih institutes and centers that fund research and program coordination offices within the nih office of the director (icos) collectively manage oppnet's scientific direction yet may not participate in every oppnet foa. consequently, applicants should review the list of icos in this foa's components of participating organizations. for more information about oppnet, visit https://oppnet.nih.gov.oppnet strives to ensure that proposed projects focus primarily on basic social, behavioral, and biopsychosocial sciences. though oppnet defers from imposing a definition on the field, oppnet uses the following statement to guide the concepts it develops toward funding opportunity announcements: basic behavioral and social sciences research (bbssr) furthers our understanding of fundamental mechanisms and patterns of behavioral and social functioning, relevant to the nation's health and wellbeing, and as they interact with each other, with biology, and with the environment. oppnet acknowledges that disease-, risk-, and wellness-contexts can provide opportunities to study basic behavioral or social processes, basic biobehavioral or biosocial interrelationships, or methodology and measurement relevant to bbssr.research objectivesoppnet recognizes that basic research in the behavioral and social sciences can be conducted in a broad variety of settings, including general population and clinical samples. it also can be embedded within studies that include disease (or risk-factor) outcomes, as long as the focus of the study is on basic behavioral or social processes, basic biobehavioral or biosocial interrelationships, or methodology and measurement relevant to bss research. applications submitted cannot include any specific aims that propose to measure clinical efficacy or effectiveness of any intervention. investigators who wish to conduct studies with clinical endpoints as the primary outcomes should consider other nih foas. the ics participating in this foa have specific interests and priorities listed below. oppnet strongly encourages researchers to contact ic-based scientific/research officials well in advance of submitting applications.national institute on aging (nia)the national institute on aging (nia) supports mechanism-based basic research under this foa, including, but not limited to, the following:nia is especially interested in dyadic-based research projects that align with the alzheimer's disease-related dementias (ad/adrd) research implementation milestones (https://www.nia.nih.gov/research/milestones). mechanistic-based research that identifies or evaluates potential targets for behavior change interventions (stage 0 of the nih stage model; https://www.nia.nih.gov/research/dbsr/stage-model-behavioral-intervention-development), to be developed within the nih science of behavior change framework (https://commonfund.nih.gov/behaviorchange), is supported under this foa.eunice kennedy shriver national institute of child health and human development (nichd)nichd seeks basic social, behavioral, and/or methodological research applications on dyads and health that align with the nichd mission to understand human development, improve reproductive health, enhance the lives of children and adolescents, and optimize abilities for all. the nichd's broad and diverse research portfolio includes research related to conception and pregnancy; normal and abnormal development in childhood; childhood trauma and critical illness; the transition from adolescence to adulthood; reproductive health; rehabilitation; intellectual, developmental, and physical disabilities; and population dynamics across the lifespan. throughout its strategic priorities, nichd encourages research that integrates cross-cutting topics: health disparities, disease prevention, infectious disease, nutrition, and global health.areas of particular interest to nichd include, but are not limited to:national institute on minority health and health disparities (nimhd)the mission of the nimhd is to lead scientific research to improve minority health and reduce health disparities. nimhd supports the study of many aspects of minority health and health disparities— from biological and population sciences to clinical, behavioral, and translational research, as well as research on health care services, health systems and workforce development. nimhd focuses on the full continuum of causes of health disparities and the interrelation of these causes. projects must include a focus on one or more of the following nih-designated populations that experience health disparities in the united states: african americans, latinos/hispanics, american indians and alaska natives, asian americans, native hawaiians and other pacific islanders, less privileged socioeconomic groups, underserved rural populations, and sexual and gender minorities (sgms). comparison groups/populations may also be included as appropriate for the research questions posed. nimhd encourages projects that use approaches encompassing multiple domains of influence (e.g., biological, behavioral, sociocultural, environmental, physical environment, health system) and multiple levels of influence (e.g., individual, interpersonal, family, peer group, community, societal) to understand and address health disparities (see the nimhd research framework, https://www.nimhd.nih.gov/about/overview/research-framework.html, for more information).nimhd will not support animal studies under this foa.for the purposes of this foa, we seek to understand the interrelation between dyad-level relationships and minority health and health disparities, including but not limited to research projects focused on the following:national institute of mental health (nimh)the national institute of mental health (nimh) supports research to discover the causes of mental illness and develop more effective and safer treatments. nimh additionally supports mental health research in hiv through its division of aids research. nimh strongly encourages applicants to consult with nimh program officials when developing plans for an application. this early contact will provide an opportunity to clarify nimh policies and guidelines, identify whether the proposed project is consistent with nimh program priorities, and determine which available foa would best support the proposed research. nimh is interested in studies of interpersonal processes as they relate to the etiology, development, characterization, identification, and treatment of mental illness. nimh encourages applicants to consider these goals when developing proposed studies that address the two broad research questions provided in the background section above. nimh is particularly interested in research that focuses on operationally-defined, empirically-supported functional domains or symptom(s) of mental disorders as opposed to broad diagnostic categories in which not all subjects may share the same underlying disease process. nimh research domain criteria (rdoc) constructs, such as those in the social processes domain, may inform mechanism-based hypotheses, the selection of measures, and criteria for enrolling participants who are experiencing (or at elevated risk of developing) disruptions in mental health. rdoc constructs are of interest for this notice, but other, non-rdoc constructs may be suitable as well, especially if they maximize the probability that participants share the same mechanism of disorder.examples of such topics include but are not limited to:finally, nimh encourages applications that are focused on interpersonal processes, and which assess mental health dimensionally, integrate multiple levels of analysis (e.g., brain-based measures, physiology, behavior, self-report), and employ advanced methodology from fields such as social, cognitive, and affective neuroscience, communication science, clinical and experimental psychology, neuroimaging, and developmental or lifespan psychology.the following areas are beyond nimh’s scope of interest for this foa:national institute of dental and craniofacial research (nidcr)the nidcr will prioritize applications that propose mechanistic research on dyadic processes relevant to dental, oral, or craniofacial health. specific topics may include:national cancer institute (nci)the nci supports research into understanding mechanisms through which dyadic processes influence cancer prevention and control outcomes, including:see section viii. other information for award authorities and regulations.grant: a support mechanism providing money, property, or both to an eligible entity to carry out

submitted to the national institute of mental health (nimh)to advance the goal of advancing research through widespread data sharing among researchers, investigators funded under this foa are expected to share those data via the national institute of mental health data archive (nda; see not-mh-19-033). established by the nih, nda is a secure informatics platform for scientific collaboration and data-sharing that enables the effective communication of detailed research data, tools, and supporting documentation. nda links data across research projects through its global unique identifier (guid) and data dictionary technology. investigators funded under this foa are expected to use these technologies to submit data to nda.to accomplish this objective, it will be important to formulate a) an enrollment strategy that will obtain the information necessary to generate a guid for each participant, and b) a budget strategy that will cover the costs of data submission. the nda website provides two tools to help investigators develop appropriate strategies: 1) the nda data submission cost model which offers a customizable excel worksheet that includes tasks and hours for the program director/principal investigator and data manager to budget for data sharing; and 2) plain language text to be considered in your informed consent available from the nda's data contribution page. investigators are expected to certify the quality of all data generated by grants funded under this foa prior to submission to nda and review their data for accuracy after submission. submission of descriptive/raw data is expected semi-annually (every january 15 and july 15); submission of all other data is expected at the time of publication, or prior to the end of the grant, whichever occurs first (see nda sharing regimen for more information); investigators are expected to share results, positive and negative, specific to the cohorts and outcome measures studied. the nda data sharing plan is available for review on the nda website. nda staff will work with investigators to help them submit data types not yet defined in the nda data dictionary.”when involving human subjects

elements in nih-funded researchmany nih ics encourage the use of common data elements (cdes) in basic, clinical, and applied research, patient registries, and other human subject research to facilitate broader and more effective use of data and advance research across studies. cdes are data elements that have been identified and defined for use in multiple data sets across different studies. use of cdes can facilitate data sharing and standardization to improve data quality and enable data integration from multiple studies and sources, including electronic health records. nih ics have identified cdes for many clinical domains (e.g., neurological disease), types of studies (e.g. genome-wide association studies (gwas)), types of outcomes (e.g., patient-reported outcomes), and patient registries (e.g., the global rare diseases patient registry and data repository). nih has established a “common data element (cde) resource portal" (http://cde.nih.gov/) to assist investigators in identifying nih-supported cdes when developing protocols, case report forms, and other instruments for data collection. the portal provides guidance about and access to nih-supported cde initiatives and other tools and resources for the appropriate use of cdes and data standards in nih-funded research. investigators are encouraged to consult the portal and describe in their applications any use they will make of nih-supported cdes in their projects.applicants are required to follow the instructions for post-submission materials, as described in the policy. any instructions provided here are in addition to the instructions in the policy.note: effective for due dates on or after january 25, 2023, the data sharing plan and genomic data sharing plan (gds) as part of the resource sharing plan will not be evaluated at time of review.only the review criteria described below will be considered in the review process. applications submitted to the nih in support of the nih mission are evaluated for scientific and technical merit through the nih peer review system.a proposed clinical trial application may include study design, methods, and intervention that are not by themselves innovative but address important questions or unmet needs. additionally, the results of the clinical trial may indicate that further clinical development of the intervention is unwarranted or lead to new avenues of scientific investigation.reviewers will provide an overall impact score to reflect their assessment of the likelihood for the project to exert a sustained, powerful influence on the research field(s) involved, in consideration of the following review criteria and additional review criteria (as applicable for the project proposed).reviewers will consider each of the review criteria below in the determination of scientific merit, and give a separate score for each. an application does not need to be strong in all categories to be judged likely to have major scientific impact. for example, a project that by its nature is not innovative may be essential to advance a field.does the project address an important problem or a critical barrier to progress in the field? is the prior research that serves as the key support for the proposed project rigorous? if the aims of the project are achieved, how will scientific knowledge, technical capability,

appropriate for the project?with regard to the proposed leadership for the project, do the pd/pi(s) and key personnel have the expertise, experience, and ability to organize, manage and implement the proposed clinical trial and meet milestones and timelines? do they have appropriate expertise in study coordination, data management and statistics? for a multicenter trial, is the organizational structure appropriate and does the application identify a core of potential center investigators and staffing for a coordinating center?does the application challenge and seek to shift current research or clinical practice paradigms by utilizing novel theoretical concepts, approaches or methodologies, instrumentation, or interventions? are the concepts, approaches or methodologies, instrumentation, or interventions novel to one field of research or novel in a broad sense? is a refinement, improvement, or new application of theoretical concepts, approaches or methodologies, instrumentation, or interventions proposed?does the design/research plan include innovative elements, as appropriate, that enhance its sensitivity, potential for information or potential to advance scientific knowledge or clinical practice?are the overall strategy, methodology, and analyses well-reasoned and appropriate to accomplish the specific aims of the project? have the investigators included plans to address weaknesses in the rigor of prior research that serves as the key support for the proposed project? have the investigators presented strategies to ensure a robust and unbiased approach, as appropriate for the work proposed? are potential problems, alternative strategies, and benchmarks for success presented? if the project is in the early stages of development, will the

vertebrate animals or human subjects?if the project involves human subjects and/or nih-defined clinical research, are the plans to address 1) the protection of human subjects from research risks, and 2) inclusion (or exclusion) of individuals on the basis of sex/gender, race, and ethnicity, as well as the inclusion or exclusion of individuals of all ages (including children and older adults), justified in terms of the scientific goals and research strategy proposed?does the application adequately address the following, if applicablestudy designis the study design justified and appropriate to address primary and secondary outcome variable(s)/endpoints that will be clear, informative and relevant to the hypothesis being tested? is the scientific rationale/premise of the study based on previously well-designed preclinical and/or clinical research? given the methods used to assign participants and deliver interventions, is the study design adequately powered to answer the research question(s), test the proposed hypothesis/hypotheses, and provide interpretable results? is the trial appropriately designed to conduct the research efficiently? are the study populations (size,
