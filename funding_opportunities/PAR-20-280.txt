section viii. other informationthe world trade center health program (wtchp) is authorized under the occupational safety and health act of 1970, section 20(a) and 21(a) (29 usc 669(a) and 29 usc 670); federal mine safety and health act, section 501(a), 30 usc 951(a); section 301 of the public health service act as amended (42 usc 241); federal regulations 42 cfr part 52 and 45 cfr part 75; and the james zadroga 9/11 health and compensation act of 2010 (public law 111–347; 42 usc 300mm – 300mm–61).the world trade center (wtc) health program is administered by the national institute for occupational safety and health (niosh). information on this program is available at the niosh wtchp website. the james zadroga 9/11 health and compensation act of 2010, public law 111–347 (hereafter referred to as “the zadroga act”) was signed by president obama on january 2, 2011, and was re-authorized on december 18, 2015. the zadroga act continues monitoring and treatment activities and requires the establishment (under subtitle c) of a research program on health conditions resulting from the september 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.the zadroga act lists the following broad research areas (title 42 usc §300mm–51):research mentioned in the zadroga act includes epidemiologic and other research studies on wtc-related health conditions or emerging conditions among (1) enrolled wtc responders and certified-eligible wtc survivors under treatment; (2) sampled populations outside the nyc disaster area, in manhattan (as far north as 14th street) and in brooklyn; and (3) control populations, to identify potential for long-term adverse health effects in less exposed populations.the zadroga act specifies establishing a wtc scientific/technical advisory committee and indicates that the wtc program administrator shall consult with the committee in carrying out research activities related to the september 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.to address the zadroga act research mandate, and in consultation with the wtc scientific/technical advisory committee, niosh is soliciting applications for scientifically rigorous research to answer critical questions about physical and mental health conditions related to the september 2001 terrorist attacks.major areas of research interest include, but are not limited to, the following:u01 projects involve longer term research to address critical questions about these, or other, clinical areas.types of clinical research areas that will be considered for potential projects include, but are not limited to:screening research: projects that evaluate current, or facilitate the development of, new/improved methods to detect certain disorders or health conditions.diagnostic research: projects that evaluate current, or facilitate the development of, new/improved, methods to identify diseases, disorders, or conditions.treatment research: projects that evaluate/identify improved treatment interventions/methods (e.g., medication, psychotherapy, dietary/nutritional, care management and coordination etc.) or promote the development of new or novel treatment approaches, e.g. telemedicine.prevention research: projects that identify/evaluate new methods and interventions (e.g., medicine(s), psychotherapy, vaccines, nutrition, or lifestyle changes) that prevent or mitigate the development or reoccurrence of various diseases/disorders.quality of life research: projects that identify, develop, or evaluate, methods/interventions that improve comfort and the quality of life for individuals with a chronic illness or multimorbidity.omics research: projects that facilitate improvement in methods/procedures for the prediction of disorders by identifying and understanding how genes and illnesses may be related (e.g., identification of phenotypes and biomarkers). research in this area may explore ways in which a person’s genes make him or her more or less likely to develop a disorder or respond to a medication.epidemiological/clinical research: projects that seek to identify the patterns, causes, and control of disorders among the wtc population, including women and those exposed to 9/11 as children. these projects will also identify, implement and improve research methods.health services research: projects that examine how people get access to health care and care management services, how much care costs, and what happens to patients as a result of this care. research projects in this area have the potential to identify improved methods/procedures to organize, manage, finance, and deliver health care.translation research: projects that evaluate the process whereby existing wtchp research outputs are translated into practical benefits to affected populations.relevant diseases or conditions include, but are not limited to:the overall objective of this announcement is to solicit meritorious and scientifically rigorous research applications that will help:researchers can review wtchp funded projects and publications by visiting the wtchp research compendium to assist with an assessment of research gaps/needs.another objective of this announcement is to help address the wide range of research needs related to the wtchp. niosh will do this by considering the following types of u01 cooperative research projects for 2020 due date/fy2021 funding:type of projectproject periodtotal cost per yearlong-termup to five yearsup to $600kintermediate-termup to three yearsup to $500kshort-termup to two yearsup to $350ka wide range of research needs can be addressed by each type of project. applicants must clearly identify the type of project they are proposing and provide sufficient supporting information. in 2021, niosh anticipates funding 2-3 long-term, 3-4 intermediate-term, and 3-4 short-term u01 projects. the project period, budget and anticipated projects to fund may vary in subsequent years of this announcement.niosh seeks to achieve a suitable mix of projects that help advance treatment effectiveness and the understanding of health and well-being impacts related to the september 2001 terrorist attacks.increased knowledge of the characteristics of wtc-related illnesses and disorders, such as pathology, prognosis, latency, and the effects of other risk factors and comorbidities, is critical for achieving improved treatment and intervention protocols. scientific evaluation of the translation of wtchp research outputs into practical benefits enhances research integration and expedites research-to-care program objectives.the wtc research program funded by this foa will contribute to the cdc strategic goal, in alignment with an hhs strategic goal and goals found in healthy people 2020 to increase the number of communities that protect and promote health and safety and prevent illness and injury to improve the safety, quality, affordability, and accessibility of health care.looking forward, healthy people 2030 is the fifth edition of healthy people. it aims at new challenges and builds on lessons learned from its first 4 decades. hhs has approved the healthy people 2030 framework which is based on recommendations made by the secretary’s advisory committee on national health promotion and disease prevention objectives for 2030.a growing body of evidence suggests that significant health conditions have emerged that are associated with the disaster, particularly for those exposed during the collapse of the towers and those who participated substantially in rescue, recovery, and clean-up operations.research mentioned in the zadroga act includes epidemiologic and other research studies on wtc-related health conditions or emerging conditions (1) among enrolled wtc responders and certified-eligible wtc survivors under treatment; and (2) in sampled populations outside the new york city disaster area in manhattan (as far north as 14th street) and in brooklyn, along with (3) control populations, to identify potential for long-term adverse health effects in less exposed populations.scientific reporting allows health care professionals to make earlier diagnoses of wtc conditions, which leads to more effective treatment. however, scientifically identifying the causes of health problems or conditions is typically very difficult. while it is often not possible to determine the specific cause of an individual's illness or condition, it is critical to promote scientifically rigorous studies and reviews of potential health problems or risk factors among the affected population.the 2019 summary of wtc health program research is a niosh research compendium that outlines the research goals and accomplishments of the wtchp, program stakeholders, and research grantees. this compendium provides the research mission as defined by the james zadroga 9/11 health and compensation act of 2010 (h.r. 847; public law 111–347). it gives a brief history of the program, an overview of the research goals, and a bibliography of all wtchp-funded research project publications and links to constituent primary investigators and program-related websites and resources.cdc/niosh solicited public comments on the scope of wtc health program research activities for the fy2021 funding cycle. the wtc health program's research program helps answer critical questions about potential 9/11-related physical and mental health, as well as diagnosing and treating health outcomes on the list of wtc-related health conditions.the public comment period closed june 1, 2020, and the comments are shared in docket cdc-2020-0035 at https://www.regulations.gov/document?d=cdc-2020-0035-0001.information about current and completed niosh-funded research studies pertaining to the world trade center can be found at https://wwwn.cdc.gov/researchgateway. the registry's annual reports, prepared for enrollees and the public, include information on its key activities and accomplishments, as well as details on recent findings about the health consequences of 9/11.the research-to-care logic model used by the wtc health program staff to evaluate the effectiveness of the wtc research program can be found at https://www.cdc.gov/wtc/pdfs/research_to_care.pdf.more information can be found in the 2019 summary of wtc health program research and public comments as described above.note: interested applicants are strongly encouraged to review the 2019 summary of wtc health program research, information on current and completed wtc research, and the registry's annual reports.the target population for research funded under this foa are individuals exposed to the september 2001 terrorist attacks, including responders and community members (also referred to as survivors). responder cohorts or populations include:community members (adults and children) who were exposed to the terrorist attacks include people who (a) still live in the nyc area or (b) have since moved away from the nyc area.interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary collaborations that share expertise are essential to advance wtchp efforts that strengthen 1) evaluating linkages between wtc exposures and uncommon health conditions, 2) diagnostic and treatment outcomes, and 3) activities to address emerging wtc health program health and wellness priorities.ancillary studies/secondary analysis of existing dataapplicants considering projects that depend on interaction or collaboration with the data centers, or the 9/11 health registry associated with the world trade center health program (“data center and wtc health registry contacts”, below) must coordinate in advance with the respective directors or administrators of the data centers to ensure access to data and/or availability of adequate numbers of potential participants are feasible to conduct the proposed research. documentation of the study recruitment plan and agreement on this coordination must be included in the application, along with any budgetary needs for the coordination activities, by providing both a letter from the investigator to the data center/health registry/wtchp and a response letter from the data

understanding and applying the elements of this framework for research projects may enhance planning effective public health strategies, improving existing programs including evidence-based activities, and demonstrating beneficial results and impact of federal funding.when relevant to the goals of the research project, applicants should describe briefly how the findings may be used to promote, enhance, or advance translation of the research into practice or may be used to inform public health policy. see wtchp research-to-care logic model.niosh considers the sharing of unique data and other research resources developed through the wtchp an important means to enhance the value, and further the advancement of, current and future research.investigators responding to this funding opportunity should include a plan on sharing research resources and data or explain why such sharing is not possible. the precise content of the plan will vary depending on the data being collected and how the investigator is planning to share the data.factors to consider include: the expected schedule for data sharing, the format of the final dataset, supporting documentation, and whether analytic tools will be provided. other considerations include whether a data sharing agreement will be required, whether any conditions will be placed on their use, and the mode of data sharing.information on data/resource sharing can be found on page ii-74 (sharing research tools) of the current hhs grants policy.hhs/cdc policy requires that grant award recipients make unique research resources and data readily available for research purposes to qualified individuals within the scientific community after publication.individuals are required to comply with the instructions for the resource sharing plans (data sharing plan; sharing model organisms; and genome wide association studies [gwas]), as provided in the sf424 (r&r) application guide.see section viii. other

to comply with the instructions for the resource sharing plans as provided in the sf424 (r&r) application guide. all applications, regardless of the amount of total costs requested for any one year, should address a data sharing plan.niosh considers the sharing of unique data and other research resources developed through the wtchp an important means to enhance the value and further the advancement of current and future research.investigators responding to this funding opportunity must include a plan for sharing research resources and data or explain why such sharing is not possible. the precise content of the plan will vary, depending on the data being collected and how the investigator is planning to share the data. factors to consider include the expected schedule for data sharing, the format of the final dataset, supporting documentation, and whether analytic tools will be provided. other considerations include whether a data sharing agreement will be required, whether any conditions will be placed on their use, and the mode of data sharing.information on data/resource sharing can be found on page ii-74 (sharing research tools) of the current hhs grants policy.hhs/cdc policy requires that grant award recipients make unique research resources and data readily available for research purposes to qualified individuals within the scientific community after publication. individuals are required to comply with the instructions for the resource sharing plans (data sharing plan; sharing model organisms; and genome wide association studies [gwas]), as provided in the sf424 (r&r) application guide.data management plan (dmp): cdc requires awardees for projects and programs that involve data collection or generation of data with federal funds to develop and submit a data management plan (dmp) for each collection of public health data.if applicable, include a dmp in the resource sharing plan section of the phs 398 research plan component of the application for each proposed collection of public health data. if the public health data to be collected or created are not appropriate for release, provided a concise rationale or justification in the dmp.the dmp may be outlined in a narrative format or as a checklist but, at a minimum, should include:examples of dmps may be found at university of california dmptool website or usgs.cdc additional requirement (ar)-25 outlines the components of a dmp and provides additional information for investigators about the requirements for data accessibility, storage, and preservation. the dmp should be developed during the project planning phase, prior to the initiation of collecting or generating public health data and be submitted with the application.applications that do not comply with these instructions may be delayed or not accepted for review. applications submitted without a required dmp may be deemed ineligible for award unless it is clearly stated why a detailed dmp is deferred to a later date and when it will be provided. in these cases, funding restrictions may be imposed on an award until the dmp is submitted and evaluated.ancillary studies/secondary analysis of existing dataapplicants considering projects that depend on interaction or collaboration with the data centers, or the 9/11 health registry associated with the world trade center health program (see “data center and wtc health registry contacts”, below) must coordinate in advance with the respective directors or administrators of the data centers to ensure access to data and/or availability of adequate numbers of potential participants are feasible to conduct the proposed research. documentation of the study recruitment plan and agreement on this coordination must be included in the

evaluate the following additional items while determining scientific and technical merit, and in providing an overall impact score, but will not give separate scores for these items.for research that involves human subjects but does not involve one of the categories of research that are exempt under 45 cfr part 46, the committee will evaluate the justification for involvement of human subjects and the proposed protections from research risk relating to their participation according to the following five review criteria: 1) risk to subjects, 2) adequacy of protection against risks, 3) potential benefits to the subjects and others, 4) importance of the knowledge to be gained, and 5) data and safety monitoring for clinical trials.for research that involves human subjects and meets the criteria for one or more of the categories of research that are exempt under 45 cfr part 46, the committee will evaluate: 1) the justification for the exemption, 2) human subjects involvement and characteristics, and 3) sources of materials. for additional information on review of the human subjects section, please refer to the guidelines for the review of human subjects.if your proposed research involves the use of human data and/or biological specimens, you must provide a justification for your claim that no human subjects are involved in the protection of human subjects section of the research plan.when the proposed project involves human subjects and/or nih-defined clinical research, the committee will evaluate the proposed plans for the inclusion (or exclusion) of individuals on the basis of sex/gender, race, and ethnicity, as well as the inclusion (or exclusion) of individuals of all ages (including children and older adults) to determine if it is justified in terms of the scientific goals and research strategy proposed. for additional information on review of the inclusion section, please refer to the guidelines for the review of inclusion in clinical research.the committee will evaluate the involvement of live vertebrate animals as part of the scientific assessment according to the following criteria: (1) description of proposed procedures involving animals, including species, strains, ages, sex, and total number to be used; (2) justifications for the use of animals versus alternative models and for the appropriateness of the species proposed; (3) interventions to minimize discomfort, distress, pain and injury; and (4) justification for euthanasia method if not consistent with the avma guidelines for the euthanasia of animals. reviewers will assess the use of chimpanzees as they would any other application proposing the use of vertebrate animals. for additional information on review of the vertebrate animals section, please refer to the worksheet for review of the vertebrate animal section.reviewers will assess whether materials or procedures proposed are potentially hazardous to research personnel and/or the environment, and if needed, determine whether adequate protection is proposed.for resubmissions, the committee will evaluate the application as now presented, taking into consideration the responses to comments from the previous scientific review group and changes made to the project.for renewals, the committee will consider the progress made in the last funding period.for revisions, the committee will consider the appropriateness of the proposed expansion of the scope of the project. if the revision application relates to a specific line of investigation presented in the original application that was not recommended for approval by the committee, then the committee will consider whether the responses to comments from the previous scientific review group are adequate and whether substantial changes are clear.dual use research of concernreviewers will identify whether the project involves one of the agents or toxins described in the us government policy for the institutional oversight of life sciences dual use research of concern, and, if so, whether the applicant has identified an ire to assess the project for durc potential and develop mitigation strategies if needed.for more information about this policy and other policies regarding dual use research of concern, visit the u.s. government science, safety, security (s3) website at: http://www.phe.gov/s3/dualuse. tools and guidance for assessing durc potential may be found at: http://www.phe.gov/s3/dualuse/documents/durc-companion-guide.pdf.study timelinefor applications proposing clinical trials:is the study timeline described in detail, taking into account start-up activities, the anticipated rate of enrollment, and planned follow-up assessment? is the projected timeline feasible and well justified? does the project incorporate efficiencies and utilize existing resources (e.g., ctsas, practice-based research networks, electronic medical records, administrative database, or patient registries) to increase the efficiency of participant enrollment and data collection, as appropriate? are potential challenges and corresponding solutions discussed (e.g., strategies that can be implemented in the event of enrollment shortfalls)?as applicable for the project proposed, reviewers will consider each of the following items, but will not give scores for these items, and should not consider them in providing an overall impact score.limitations of currently available datahealth effects related to the september 2001 terrorist attacks are primarily a result of exposure during the attacks, while responding to the resulting disaster, or while living in the area during the disaster response, remediation, and cleanup efforts. scientifically identifying the causes of health problems or conditions is typically very difficult because of independent factors unrelated to the september 2001 terrorist attacks that may contribute to the onset of specific diseases. likewise, health conditions existing prior to exposures related to the september 2001 terrorist attacks may also be contributing factors.reviewers should consider that a standardized body of pre-existing medical data for all potential study subjects may not exist. in addition, the paucity of reliable, comprehensive environmental measurements could make quantifying exposures very difficult.although often it may not be possible to determine the specific cause of an individual's illness or condition, it is critical to promote scientifically rigorous studies and reviews of potential health problems or risk factors among the affected population. reviewers should consider how well applicants acknowledge and address the limitations in currently available data.project dissemination planreviewers will assess whether the proposal includes an adequate plan for summarizing and disseminating results. the dissemination plan should include:• publication of results in peer-reviewed scientific journals;• presentation of results at scientific conferences (specify the target conferences);• presentation of findings/progress at the bi-annual wtc research grantee meetings; and• presentation of results to diverse interested groups or stakeholder organizations.project evaluation planreviewers will assess whether the proposal includes an adequate plan for evaluating outputs, outcomes, and impacts. the evaluation plan should:• identify personnel responsible for evaluating study activities and quality of collected data;• describe assessments of the quality and accuracy of collected data;• describe training and supervision of personnel gathering and analyzing data;• describe the review of recruitment goals and preliminary results; and• identify how emerging problems will be resolved.not applicable.reviewers will assess the information provided in this section of the application, including 1) the select agent(s) to be used in the proposed research, 2) the registration status of all entities where select agent(s) will be used, 3) the procedures that will be used to monitor possession use and transfer of select agent(s), and 4) plans for appropriate biosafety, biocontainment, and security of the select agent(s).hhs/cdc policy requires that recipients of grant awards make research resources and data readily available for research purposes to qualified individuals within the scientific community after publication. please see ar-25.niosh considers the sharing of unique data and other research resources developed through the wtchp an important means to enhance the value and further the advancement of current and future research.the reasonableness of the resource sharing plan, or the rationale for not sharing research data, will be assessed by the reviewers. the reviewers will not, however, factor the proposed plan into the determination of scientific merit or the impact score.reviewers will comment on whether the following resource sharing plans, or the rationale for not sharing the following types of resources, are reasonable: (1) data sharing plan; (2) sharing model organisms; and (3) genomic data sharing plan (gds).additional requirement: cdc requires recipients for projects and programs that involve data collection or generation of data with federal funds to develop and submit a data management plan (dmp) for each collection of public health data.investigators responding to this announcement should include a detailed dmp in the resource sharing plan(s) section of the phs 398 research plan component of the application. the ar-25 outlines the components of a dmp and provides additional information for investigators regarding the requirements for data accessibility, storage, and preservation.the dmp should be developed during the project planning phase prior to the initiation of collecting or generating public health data and will be submitted with the application. the submitted dmp will be evaluated for completeness and quality at the time of submission.the dmp may be outlined in a narrative format or as a checklist but, at a minimum, should include: 1) descriptions of the data to be produced in the proposed project; 2) how access will be provided to the data (including provisions for protection of privacy, confidentiality, security, intellectual property, or other rights); 3) use of data standards that ensure all released data have appropriate documentation that describes the method of collection, what the data represent, and potential limitations for use; and 4) plans for archival and long-term preservation of the data, or explaining why long-term preservation and access cannot be justified.for projects involving key biological and/or chemical resources, reviewers will comment on the brief plans proposed for identifying and ensuring the validity of those resources.reviewers will consider whether the budget and the requested period of support are fully justified and reasonable in relation to the proposed research. the applicant

applicant as described in the hhs grants policy statement.a formal notification in the form of a notice of award (noa) will be provided to the applicant organization for successful applications. the noa signed by the grants management officer is the authorizing document and will be sent via email to the grantee’s business official.awardees must comply with any funding restrictions described in section iv.6. funding restrictions. selection of an application for award is not an authorization to begin performance. any costs incurred before receipt of the noa are at the recipient's risk. these costs may be reimbursed only to the extent considered allowable pre-award costs.any application awarded in response to this foa will be subject to terms and conditions found on the cdc office of financial resources website. this includes any recent legislation and policy applicable to awards that is highlighted on this website.although the financial plans of the hhs/cdc cio(s) provide support for this program, awards pursuant to this funding opportunity depend upon the availability of funds, evidence of satisfactory progress by the recipient (as documented in required reports) and the determination that continued funding is in the best interest of the federal government.institutional review board or independent ethics committee approval: grantee institutions must ensure that protocols are reviewed by their irb or iec. to help ensure the safety of participants enrolled in cdc-funded studies, the awardee must provide cdc copies of documents related to all major changes in the status of ongoing protocols. for multi-site research, please see nih single irb policy.expanded authorities: any award resulting from an application under this foa is for research and cdc has automatically waived the prior approvals listed in 45 cfr 75.308(d) (1) through (3). in accordance with hhs regulation and cdc guidance, the awardee will have expanded authorities including for post award prior approvals, except for the following three expanded authorities: 1) human and animal welfare requirements, 2) acquisition of equipment, and 3) change of principal investigator.diversity

administrative requirements (policies) found on the cdc office of financial resources, grant, webpage.recipients of federal financial assistance (ffa) from hhs must administer their programs in compliance with federal civil rights law. this means that recipients of hhs funds must ensure equal access to their programs without regard to a person’s race, color, national origin, disability, age and, in some circumstances, sex and religion. this includes ensuring your programs are accessible to persons with limited english proficiency. hhs recognizes that research projects are often limited in scope for many reasons that are nondiscriminatory, such as the principal investigator’s scientific interest, funding limitations, recruitment requirements, and other considerations. thus, criteria in research protocols that target or exclude certain populations are warranted where nondiscriminatory justifications establish that such criteria are appropriate with respect to the health or safety of the subjects, the scientific study design, or the purpose of the research.for additional guidance regarding how the provisions apply to cdc grant programs, please contact the scientific/research contact that is identified in section vii under agency contacts of this foa. hhs provides general guidance to recipients of ffa on meeting their legal obligation to take reasonable steps to provide meaningful access to their programs by persons with limited english proficiency. the hhs office for civil rights also provides guidance on complying with civil rights laws enforced by hhs. please visit here and here for more information. recipients of ffa also have specific legal obligations for serving qualified individuals with disabilities. please contact the hhs office for civil rights for more information about obligations and prohibitions under federal civil rights laws here or call 1-800-368-1019 or tdd 1-800-537-7697. also note it is an hhs departmental goal to ensure access to quality, culturally competent care, including long-term services and supports, for vulnerable populations. for further guidance on providing culturally and linguistically appropriate services, recipients should review the national standards for culturally and linguistically appropriate services in health and health care here.prior to making a federal award, cdc is required by 31 u.s.c. 3321 and 41 u.s.c. 2313 to review information available through any omb-designated repositories of government-wide eligibility qualification or financial integrity information as appropriate. see also suspension and debarment requirements at 2 cfr parts 180 and 376.in accordance 41 u.s.c. 2313, cdc is required to review the non-public segment of the omb-designated integrity and performance system accessible through sam (currently the federal awardee performance and integrity information system (fapiis)) prior to making a federal award where the federal share is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold, defined in 41 u.s.c. 134, over the period of performance. at a minimum, the information in the system for a prior federal award recipient must demonstrate a satisfactory record of executing programs or activities under federal grants, cooperative agreements, or procurement awards; and integrity and business ethics. cdc may make a federal award to a recipient who does not fully meet these standards, if it is determined that the information is not relevant to the current federal award under consideration or there are specific conditions that can appropriately mitigate the effects of the non-federal entity's risk in accordance with 45 cfr §75.207.cdc’s framework for evaluating the risks posed by an applicant may incorporate results of the evaluation of the applicant's eligibility or the quality of its application. if it is determined that a federal award will be made, special conditions that correspond to the degree of risk assessed may be applied to the federal award. in evaluating risks posed by applicants, cdc will use a risk-based approach and may consider any items such as the following:cdc must comply with the guidelines on government-wide suspension and debarment in 2 cfr part 180 and require non-federal entities to comply with these provisions. these provisions restrict federal awards, subawards and contracts with certain parties that are debarred, suspended or otherwise excluded from or ineligible for participation in federal programs or activities.ars outline the administrative requirements found in 45 cfr part 75, the hhs grants policy statement, and other requirements as mandated by statute or cdc policy. recipients must comply with administrative and national policy requirements as appropriate. for

https://www.phe.gov/s3/dualuse/pages/default.aspx.non-compliance with this policy may result in suspension, limitation, restriction or termination of usg funding, or loss of future usg funding opportunities for the non-compliant usg-funded research project and of usg funds for other life sciences research at the institution, consistent with existing regulations and policies governing usg funded research, and may subject the institution to other potential penalties under applicable laws and regulations.federal information security management actall information systems, electronic or hard copy which contain federal data need to be protected from unauthorized access. this also applies to information associated with niosh grants and contracts. congress and the omb have instituted laws, policies and directives that govern the creation and implementation of federal information security practices that pertain specifically to grants and contracts. the current regulations are pursuant to the federal information security management act (fisma), 44 u.s.c. 3541 et seq. the applicability of fisma to niosh recipient applies only when recipients collect, store, process, transmit or use information on behalf of hhs or any of its component organizations. in all other cases, fisma is not applicable to recipients of grants, including cooperative agreements. the recipient retains the original data and intellectual property, and is responsible for the security of this data, subject to all applicable laws protecting security, privacy, and research. when information collected by a recipient is provided to hhs, responsibility for the protection of the hhs copy of the information is transferred to hhs and it becomes the agency's responsibility to protect that information and any derivative copies as required by fisma.cooperative agreement terms and conditions of awardthe following special terms of award are in addition to, and not in lieu of, otherwise applicable u.s. office of management and budget (omb) administrative guidelines, u.s. department of health and human services (hhs) grant administration regulations at 45 cfr parts 74 and 92 (part 92 is applicable when state and local governments are eligible to apply), and other hhs, phs, and cdc grant administration policies.the administrative and funding instrument used for this program will be the cooperative agreement, an “assistance” mechanism (rather than an “acquisition” mechanism), in which substantial cdc programmatic involvement with the awardees is anticipated during the performance of the activities. under the cooperative agreement, the hhs/cdc purpose is to support and stimulate the recipients’ activities by involvement and otherwise working jointly with the award recipients in a partnership role; it is not to assume direction, prime responsibility, or a dominant role in the activities. consistent with this concept, the dominant role and prime responsibility resides with the awardees for the project, although specific tasks and activities may be shared among the awardees and hhs/cdc as defined below.the pds/pis will have primary responsibility for the following:awardees will retain custody of and have primary rights to the data and software developed under these awards, subject to government rights of access consistent with current hhs, phs, and cdc policies.niosh staff with relevant subject matter expertise may have substantial programmatic involvement that is above and beyond the normal stewardship role in awards. these include, but are not limited to, these activities:specific substantial involvement activities for niosh project scientists will be negotiated further with each grantee as part of the pre-award process. this will include adding special terms and conditions in the noa.niosh program official (po)additionally, the scientific/research contact named in this announcement will serve as the program official (po) for all awards. this person will be responsible for the normal scientific and programmatic stewardship of these awards and will be named in the noas. the po will have programmatic involvement during the conduct of this activity through approval of progress reports, human subjects protection, and advice and coordination commensurate with normal program stewardship for grants. other po responsibilities include these:areas of joint responsibilityresponsibilities are divided between awardees and niosh staff as described above. substantial involvement responsibilities of niosh project scientists will be collaborative, consultative, and facilitative, not proscriptive, in nature.dispute resolutionany disagreements that may arise in scientific or programmatic matters (within the scope of the award) between award recipients and niosh may be brought to dispute resolution. a dispute resolution panel will be convened and will have three members: a designee of the awardee, a niosh designee, and a designee with expertise in the relevant area who is chosen by the other two. this special dispute resolution procedure does not alter the awardee's right to appeal an adverse action that is otherwise appealable in accordance with phs regulations 42 cfr part 50, subpart d, and hhs regulations 45 cfr part 16.when multiple years are involved, awardees will be required to submit the research performance progress report (rppr) annually and financial statements as required in the hhs grants policy statement. program staff will evaluate the effectiveness of resource sharing as part of the administrative review of each non-competing continuation grant progress report.a final progress report, invention statement, and the expenditure data portion of the federal financial report are required for closeout of an award, as described in the hhs grants policy statement.the federal funding accountability and transparency act of 2006 (transparency act), includes a requirement for awardees of federal grants to report information about first-tier subawards and executive compensation under federal assistance awards issued in fy2011 or later. compliance with this law is primarily the responsibility of the federal agency. however, two elements of the law require information to be collected and reported by awardees: 1) information on executive compensation when not already reported through the sam registration; and 2) similar information on all sub-awards/ subcontracts/ consortiums over $25,000. all awardees of applicable cdc grants and cooperative agreements are required to report to the federal subaward reporting system (fsrs) on all subawards over $25,000. see the hhs grants policy statement for additional information on this reporting requirement.in accordance with the regulatory requirements provided at 45 cfr 75.113 and appendix xii to 45 cfr part 75, recipients that have currently active federal grants, cooperative agreements, and procurement contracts from all federal awarding agencies with a cumulative total value greater than $10,000,000 for any period of time during the period of performance of a federal award, must report and maintain the currency of information reported in the system for award management (sam) about civil, criminal, and administrative proceedings in connection with the award or performance of a federal award that reached final disposition within the most recent five-year period.the recipient must also make semiannual disclosures regarding such proceedings. proceedings information will be made publicly available in the designated integrity and performance system (currently fapiis). this is a statutory requirement under section 872 of public law 110-417, as amended (41 u.s.c. 2313). as required by section 3010 of public law 111-212, all information posted in the designated integrity and performance system on or after april 15, 2011, except past performance reviews required for federal procurement contracts, will be publicly available. full reporting requirements and procedures are found in appendix xii to 45 cfr part 75 – award term and conditions for recipient integrity and performance matters.the recipient organization must provide hhs/cdc with an original, plus one hard copy of the following reports:1. yearly non-competing grant progress report. the rppr is due 90 to 120 days prior to the end of the current budget period and is to be completed on the era commons website. the progress report will serve as the non-competing continuation application. although the financial plans of the hhs/cdc cio(s) provide support for this program, awards pursuant to this funding opportunity are contingent upon the availability of funds, evidence of satisfactory progress by the recipient (as documented in required reports) and the determination that continued funding is in the best interest of the federal government.2. annual federal financial report (ffr) sf 425 is required and must be submitted through era commons within 90 days after the end of the calendar quarter in which the budget period ends.3. a final progress report, invention statement, equipment/inventory report, and the

financial reportingthe annual federal financial report (ffr) sf 425 is required and must be submitted through era commons within 90 days after the end of the calendar quarter in which the budget period ends. the ffr should only include those funds authorized and disbursed during the timeframe covered by the report. the final ffr must indicate the exact balance of unobligated funds and may not reflect any unliquidated obligations. there must be no discrepancies between the final ffr expenditure data and the payment management system's (pms) cash transaction data.failure to submit the required information in a timely manner may adversely affect the future funding of this project. if the information cannot be provided by the due date, you are required to submit a letter explaining the reason and date by which the grants officer will receive the information. the due date for final ffrs will continue to be 90 days after the period of performance end date.grantees must submit closeout reports in a timely manner. unless the grants management officer (gmo) of the awarding institute or center approves an extension, grantees must submit a final ffr, final progress report, and final invention statement and certification within 90 days of the end of grant period. failure to submit timely and accurate final reports may affect future funding to the organization or awards under the direction of the same project director/principal investigator (pd/pi).ffr (sf 425) instructions for cdc grantees are now available at nih forms library. for further information, contact grantsinfo@nih.gov. additional resources concerning the efsr/ffr system, including a user guide and an on-line demonstration, can be found on the era commons support page.ffr submission: the submission of ffrs to cdc will require organizations to register with era commons (commons). cdc recommends that this one-time registration process be completed at least 2 weeks prior to the submittal date of an ffr submission.organizations may verify their current registration status by running the “list of commons registered organizations” query found at: era common registration & accounts. organizations not yet registered can go to welcome to the commons for instructions. it generally takes several days to complete this registration process. this registration is independent of
