institute of mental health (nimh) national institute on drug abuse (nida)national institute on drug abuse (nida)this notice of special interest (nosi) highlights interest in mental health services and implementation science research to support the adoption and sustainability of evidence-based practices (ebps) in community-based settings that deliver care to people with mental illness. these settings could include, but are not limited to, certified community behavioral health clinics (ccbhcs) funded through the substance abuse and mental health services administration (samhsa) certified community behavioral health clinic-expansion (ccbhc-e) grant program.the national institute of mental health (nimh), the national institute on drug abuse (nida), and the substance abuse and mental health services administration (samhsa) recognize that effective research-practice partnerships are crucial for identifying salient research questions and developing and testing realistic, adoptable, scalable, and sustainable implementation strategies that promote continuously improving mental and behavioral health care. to be competitive, researchers must partner with healthcare delivery organizations and/or organizations charged to deliver implementation support to healthcare delivery organizations. examples of healthcare delivery organizations include current ccbhc-e awardees (https://www.samhsa.gov/grants/2021/ccbhc-awards) and organizations applying for ccbhc-e grant funding (e.g.,funding through sm-22-002: certified community behavioral health clinic (ccbhc) – planning, development, and implementation grants (ccbhc–pdi) and sm-22-012: certified community behavioral health clinic (ccbhc) – improvement and advancement grants (ccbhc–ia), with additional information here. an example of an organization charged to deliver implementation support includes the samhsa-funded technical assistance (ta) center.backgroundccbhcs are funded to increase access to and improve the quality of community mental and substance use disorder treatment services. ccbhcs provide person- and family-centered integrated services and access to 24/7 crisis intervention services for all individuals across the lifespan in need of behavioral health services in the geographic catchment area served by the ccbhc. these populations include individuals with serious mental illness (smi); substance use disorders (sud), including opioid use disorder; children and youth with serious emotional disturbance (sed); individuals with co-occurring mental illness and substance disorders (cod); and people experiencing a mental health or substance use related crisis. samhsa expects that this program will improve behavioral health care for individuals across the lifespan by supporting providers to operate in accordance with the federal ccbhc criteria and increasing access to and availability of high-quality services that are responsive to the needs of the community; using evidence-based practices that meet the needs of individuals served; and working to continually measure and improve the quality of services. samhsa currently funds 402 ccbhc-e grants across the country. a listing of currently funded cchbc grant recipients is available here https://www.samhsa.gov/grants/2021/ccbhc-awards.in 2022, samhsa issued two funding announcements to expand the certified community behavioral health clinic-expansion program and fund up to 370 additional ccbhc-e awardees nationwide: sm-22-002: certified community behavioral health clinic (ccbhc) – planning, development, and implementation grants (ccbhc–pdi) and sm-22-012: certified community behavioral health clinic (ccbhc) – improvement and advancement grants (ccbhc–ia).awardees from the samhsa funding announcement will receive $1 million per year for 4 years to establish new clinical programs under the ccbhc model.ccbhc-e awardees can dedicate a portion of their funding to engage in activities related to best practice implementation. here, ccbhc-e awardees will be expected to engage with the samhsa-funded ta center and propose activities that would assist with the implementation of and adherence to appropriate evidence-based treatments and practices for individuals with complex behavioral and physical health needs. additional details can be found here.this nosi invites mental health and substance use services researchers to collaborate with ccbhc-e awardees, ta-center awardees, and/or other community-based centers delivering mental or physical health or substance use-related services to propose research studies that will advance understanding of best practices in clinical program implementation. research grant applications can be submitted through any of the nimh or nida funding opportunity announcements (foas) listed below.nimh, nida, and samhsa recognize the potential for effective research practice partnerships to advance care delivery for people with mental illness and/or substance use disorders who are being treated in community health centers like ccbhcs. this nosi encourages research practice partnerships and the development of meritorious research projects that can a) answer important research questions that have broad relevance beyond the participating clinics and b) generate knowledge that can ultimately be used to improve care for people with mental illness, including smi, sed, substance use disorders, and other co-occurring conditions.examples of high priority projects include, but are not limited to the following:ic specific application and submission
