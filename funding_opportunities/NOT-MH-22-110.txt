mission of the institutes/centers. the following nih offices may co-fund applications assigned to those institutes/centers.office of research on women's health (orwh)the national action alliance for suicide prevention's (action alliance) crisis services task force summarized needed crisis services for suicide prevention in their 2016 report, crisis now: transforming services is within our reach. the report describes effective crisis care as a systematic approach, optimized when delivered with the following characteristics: regional or statewide crisis call centers that use technology to support real-time coordination across a system of care; centrally deployed mobile crisis outreach and support on a 24/7 basis; and crisis services that can diagnose and provide short term stabilization. in addition to their therapeutic value for the individual in crisis, effective crisis systems that support individuals in suicide distress have been reported to be successful diversions from law enforcement by supporting emergency care that reduces avoidable hospital admissions, arrest, and incarceration.since not-mh-19-025, priority research opportunities on suicide prevention crisis services, was issued, evidence-based crisis services have become an even greater priority with the national suicide hotline designation act of 2020. the act designates "9-8-8" as the universal telephone number in the united states for the national suicide prevention and mental health and substance use crisis hotline system. built upon the national suicide prevention lifeline (nspl), 988 will be a nationally available toll-free portal. it will be a centralized number that builds on the current national suicide prevention lifeline. it holds the potential for an effective system that can also dispatch local mobile crisis response if needed, and/or refer to a crisis receiving center or hospital emergency department. fully realized, a 988 behavioral health crisis response line would also have follow-up protocols to maintain continued contact until the crisis is resolved. the new number must be launched and operational nationwide by july 2022. it is anticipated that the broader scope of 988—including mental health (mh) and substance use (su) crises—along with a simplified number, will greatly expand the call demand, and crisis service needs.in anticipation of those needs, samhsa published an online compendium, crisis services: meeting needs, saving lives that contains best practice toolkits and related papers that address crisis services, homelessness, technology advances, substance use, legal issues impacting crisis services, financing crisis care, diverse populations, children and adolescents, rural and frontier areas, and the role of law enforcement to help localities plan, build or improve their suicide prevention activities, and to better address mental health and substance use crisis services. in november 2020, the action alliance launched the mental health & suicide prevention national response to covid-19, which includes action steps to remedy long-standing needs for alternatives to criminal justice responses to mental and substance use crises. samhsa has issued grants in support of increasing access to quality community crisis services. for example, the certified community behavioral health clinics (ccbhcs) expansion grants require that crisis services be included in the array of services the ccbhc grants support. the more than 430 ccbhcs in operation are required to provide comprehensive 24/7 access to community-based mental and substance use disorder services; treatment of co-occurring disorders; and physical healthcare in one single location. additionally, cms has issued planning grants to 20 state medicaid agencies to provide qualifying community-based mobile crisis intervention services.as states and localities build, increase, and/or improve their existing crisis service systems, it will be critical to understand which approaches are most effective. across the continuum of crisis services, measurement-based care approaches to determine cost effectiveness, quality, and outcomes of crisis services will be needed to demonstrate intervention effectiveness and identify areas for further improvement. as such, the national institutes of health seeks research conducted in real-world settings, where a wide range of clinical presentations, psychosocial factors, age-related (e.g., youth; adult; older adult), geographic (rural/remote settings), cultural considerations, and health disparities influence the types of care that are provided. examples of nimh and nida studies that are encouraged through this notice address the continuum of crisis service systems. applications that include crisis services for children and under-resourced populations are encouraged. topics of research interest span the crisis care continuum, including the effectiveness of these components: call center capabilities to address distress and coordinate care, deployed mobile crisis outreach and support, and crisis services that can diagnose and provide short term stabilization. these areas include, but are not limited to the following:treatment and services interventionstriage, dispatch, and other forms of decision supportstrategies to promote service engagement/continuity, and quality of care, including studies focused on:the national institute of mental health (nimh) and national institute on drug abuse (nida) encourage research that addresses institute priorities and is aligned with these recommended areas. for research on the effectiveness of interventions or services, nimh supports studies that employ an experimental therapeutics approach, whereby clinical trials are designed not only to test the intervention effects on outcomes of interest, but also to inform understanding of the intervention’s mechanisms of action. as such, applications to nimh that propose to develop and/or test the efficacy/ effectiveness of preventive, therapeutic, or services interventions must include specification of the intervention target(s)/mechanism(s) and assessment of intervention-induced changes in the presumed target mechanism(s) that are hypothesized to account for the intervention outcome. in the case of services interventions, targets/mechanisms might involve mutable consumer- or provider-behaviors, or organizational-/system-level factors that are intervened upon in order to improve access, continuity, quality, equity, and/or value of services. studies adapting existing preventive, therapeutic, or services interventions to specifically target customers in employment and training settings should provide a justification for the unique targets to be tested. research generating new information about factors causing/reducing disparities in outcomes is strongly encouraged as it may inform other intervention areas. see the support for clinical trials at nimh web page for additional information regarding dedicated funding opportunity announcements (foas) for nimh clinical trials research support.given the focus on scalable, sustainable approaches, nimh and nida encourage interventions that can readily be integrated into community practice, that can be delivered using existing service platforms/ personnel/resources, and that incorporate features that are specifically designed to prevent threats to implementation fidelity. strategies that might be used to enhance sustained implementation and scalability include but are not limited to consumer-facing technology (e.g., self-administered content) and responder -facing technology (e.g., technology to provide responder support, training and sustained implementation with fidelity), mh or su specialty consultation via existing resources or other sustainable means (e.g., on the spot video consultation; telehealth, collaborative care approaches); or other robust design features that promote responder/provider competence and sustained implementation fidelity. to facilitate the translation into practice, this initiative is intended to support research that reflects a deployment-focused model of intervention and services design and testing that considers the perspective of key stakeholders (e.g., service users, crisis responders, providers, administrators, payers) and the characteristics of the settings (e.g., resources, including workforce capacity; existing clinical workflows) in the community settings where optimized prevention strategies are intended to be implemented.nih office of research on women's health (orwh)as part of the nih office of the director, orwh works in partnership with the 27 nih institutes and centers to ensure that women's health research is part of the nih scientific framework and supported throughout the biomedical enterprise. across the crisis services continuum, women have historically faced inequities including unique risk factors for exposure, barriers to reproductive and mental health care, and inadequate pathways for escaping victimization. global events such as the covid-19 pandemic, climate emergencies and conflict-related displacements magnify gaps in crisis services for women and girls already experiencing health inequities. with this in mind, orwh is interested in co-funding research to directly address women's barriers to care and providing support through bolstering the integration of trauma-informed, contextually relevant, and gender-sensitive responses within crisis service systems. projects focused on groups of women and girls who are understudied, underrepresented, and underreported in research, exploring sex and gender differences, considering intersectionality and multidimensional frameworks, and intervening across multiple levels in partnership with diverse stakeholders are highly encouraged. orwh is additionally interested in supporting research aiming to reduce stress for crisis hotline workers, many of whom are women. for additional guidance on areas of interest to the orwh, please refer to the 2019-2023 trans-nih strategic plan for the health of women on the orwh website (https://www.nih.gov/women/strategicplan).ic specific application and submission information:applicants must select the ic and associated foa to use for submission of an
