application forms & instructions must be used for due dates on or after january 25, 2023 - new grant application instructions now availablesee section iii. 3. additional information on eligibility.the purpose of this funding opportunity announcement (foa) is to encourage applications to pursue invasive neural recording studies focused on mental health-relevant questions. invasive neural recordings provide an unparalleled window into the human brain to explore the neural circuitry and neural dynamics underlying complex moods, emotions, cognitive functions, and behaviors with high spatial and temporal resolution. additionally, the ability to stimulate, via the same electrodes, allows for direct causal tests by modulating network dynamics. this foa aims to target a gap in the scientific knowledge of neural circuit function related to mental health disorders. researchers should target specific questions suited to invasive recording modalities that have high translational potential. development of new therapies is outside the scope of this foa, though development of novel tools/methods to enable relevant mental health studies is encouraged.this foa uses the r21 grant mechanism, encouraging shorter, higher-risk applications, whereas its companion funding opportunity, par-23-093, seeks r01 grant applications.not applicableall applications are due by 5:00 pm local time of

purpose of this funding opportunity announcement (foa) is to encourage researchers to utilize invasive neural recording opportunities in humans to study the underlying neural circuity of mental health disorders. invasive neural recordings in humans provide an unparalleled window into the human brain to explore the neural circuitry underlying complex moods, emotions, cognition, and behaviors with high spatial and temporal resolution. additionally, the ability to stimulate those circuits, via the same electrodes, allows for direct causal tests by modulating network dynamics. understanding what circuits are involved in complex behaviors in humans, and how to manipulate relevant circuits into preferred states, will inform brain stimulation therapies of the future. studies submitted to this foa should focus on mental health questions of high translational potential, though need not lead to immediate therapies.this foa encourages applications from diverse teams of clinical researchers. teams may include members from the fields of neurosurgery, electrophysiology, neuroscience, engineering, psychiatry and psychology with the expertise necessary to conduct rigorous human-based research. teams will define what brain recording opportunity will be used and why their behavioral assay has mental health relevance. although small sample sizes are to be expected, researchers are encouraged to collaborate to increase patient recruitment.backgrounddeep brain stimulation (dbs) has the potential to treat the most treatment-refractory patients. however, recent large clinical trials failed to demonstrate positive effects of dbs over sham stimulation. deeper understanding of the circuitry underlying mental health disorders is necessary to advance both invasive and non-invasive approaches to treating mental health disorders.invasive neural recordings provide an excellent opportunity to explore the circuitry underlying complex human behavior and to translate lessons from animal research. these opportunities arise during the normal treatment course of a variety of clinical conditions. invasive recordings in humans have advanced our understanding of language, sensorimotor control, and memory. similar methods to those used to advance these areas of human neuroscience could be utilized to explore mental health-relevant questions.invasive recording opportunities can include intra-operative micro-electrode or strip recordings during dbs surgery, acute epilepsy monitoring electrocorticography (ecog) or depth electrode recordings, or chronic deep brain stimulation/responsive neural stimulation (dbs/rns) devices capable of recording and stimulating. in many cases, the underlying condition necessitating implantation will not be related to a mental health clinical indication. however, many relevant patient populations (e.g., epilepsy and parkinson’s patients) represent an enriched sample of mental health comorbidities. careful measurement of fluctuating mood, cognitive, and behavioral patterns of both patients with and without mental health disorders can provide unique insights into behavioral network dynamics, as demonstrated by early research in this field.direct neural stimulation will complement invasive recordings by enabling researchers to test mechanistic hypotheses and explore therapeutic options. network activity correlated with mood/cognitive/behavioral changes (using dense behavioral assessments) can be modulated to assess behavioral improvements. similar approaches could directly test circuit-based hypotheses and inform stimulation parameters to be utilized in dbs therapies. likewise, a map of neural networks elucidated by electrophysiological methods could inform device development by demonstrating the mental health-specific anatomical requirements necessary for future brain stimulation therapies. while current dbs and non-invasive brain stimulation therapies target localized areas, this research may demonstrate the distributed nodes involved in disorders, and therefore inform the design of new devices.specific areas of interestresearch related to this initiative may include, but is not limited to, studies of:the r21 grant mechanism of this funding opportunity encourages shorter, higher-risk applications with less (or no) preliminary data while the r01 encourages longer projects with preliminary data.applications not responsive to the foastudies that are not responsive to this foa and will not be reviewed include the following:the nimh has published updated policies and guidance

under this foa are expected to share those data via the national data archive (nda; see not-mh-19-033). established by the nih, nda is a secure informatics platform for scientific collaboration and data-sharing that enables the effective communication of detailed research data, tools, and supporting documentation. nda links data across research projects through its global unique identifier (guid) and data dictionary technology. investigators funded under this foa are expected to use these technologies to submit data to nda.to accomplish this objective, it will be important to formulate a) an enrollment strategy that will obtain the information necessary to generate a guid for each participant, and b) a budget strategy that will cover the costs of data submission. the nda web site provides two tools to help investigators develop appropriate strategies: 1) the nda data submission cost model which offers a customizable excel worksheet that includes tasks and hours for the program director/principal investigator and data manager to budget for data sharing; and 2) plain language text to be considered in your informed consent available from the nda's data contribution page. investigators are expected to certify the quality of all data generated by grants funded under this foa prior to submission to nda and review their data for accuracy after submission. submission of descriptive/raw data is expected semi-annually (every january 15 and july 15); submission of all other data is expected at the time of publication, or prior to the end of the grant, whichever occurs first (see nda sharing regimen for more information); investigators are expected to share results, positive and negative, specific to the cohorts and outcome measures studied. the nda data sharing plan is available for review on the nda website. nda staff will work with investigators to help them submit data types not yet defined in the nda data dictionary.only limited appendix materials are

data elements (cdes) in basic, clinical, and applied research, patient registries, and other human subject research to facilitate broader and more effective use of data and advance research across studies. cdes are data elements that have been identified and defined for use in multiple data sets across different studies. use of cdes can facilitate data sharing and standardization to improve data quality and enable data integration from multiple studies and sources, including electronic health records. nih ics have identified cdes for many clinical domains (e.g., neurological disease), types of studies (e.g. genome-wide association studies (gwas)), types of outcomes (e.g., patient-reported outcomes), and patient registries (e.g., the global rare diseases patient registry and data repository). nih has established a “common data element (cde) resource portal" (http://cde.nih.gov/) to assist investigators in identifying nih-supported cdes when developing protocols, case report forms, and other instruments for data collection. the portal provides guidance about and access to nih-supported cde initiatives and other tools and resources for the appropriate use of cdes and data standards in nih-funded research. investigators are encouraged to consult the portal and describe in their applications any use they will make of nih-supported cdes in their projects.nimh has released expectations for collecting common data elements when an application involves human research participants. details can be found at not-mh-20-067 and the nimh webpage on data sharing for applicants and awardees.applicants are required to follow the instructions for post-submission materials, as described in the policy1. criteriaonly the review criteria described below will be considered in the review process. applications submitted to the nih in support of the nih mission are evaluated for scientific and technical merit through the nih peer review system.note: effective for due dates on or after january 25, 2023, the data sharing plan and genomic data sharing plan (gds) will not be evaluated at time of review.for this particular announcement, note the following:the r21
