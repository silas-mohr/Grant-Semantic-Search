national institutes of health (nih)national institute of neurological disorders and stroke (ninds)u01 research project – cooperative agreementssee section iii. 3. additional information on eligibility.this foa encourages applications for exploratory clinical trials of investigational agents (drugs, biologics, surgical therapies or devices) that may contribute to the justification for and provide the data required for designing a future trial, for biomarker validation studies, or for proof of mechanism clinical studies. diseases chosen for study should be based on the ninds' strategic plan and clinical research interests (www.ninds.nih.gov/funding/areas/index.htm). successful applicants will be given access to the neuronext infrastructure. following peer review, ninds will prioritize and order trials that are given access to the neuronext infrastructure. the neuronext clinical coordinating center (ccc) will work with the successful applicant to efficiently implement the proposed study. the neuronext data coordinating center (dcc) will provide statistical and data management support. the neuronext clinical sites will provide recruitment/retention support as well as on-site implementation of the clinical protocol.applicants do not need to be part of the existing neuronext infrastructure.not applicableall applications are due by 5:00 pm local time of applicant organization. all types of non-aids applications allowed for this funding opportunity announcement are due on the listed date(s).applicants are encouraged to apply early to allow adequate time to make any corrections to errors found in the application during the submission process by the due date.not applicableit is critical that applicants follow the instructions in the research (r) instructions in the sf424 (r&r) application guide, except where instructed to do otherwise (in this foa or in a notice from nih guide for grants and contracts).conformance to all requirements (both in the application guide and the foa) is required and strictly enforced. applicants must read and follow all application instructions in the application guide as well as any program-specific instructions noted in section iv. when the program-specific instructions deviate from those in the application guide, follow the program-specific instructions.applications that do not comply with these instructions may be delayed or not accepted for review.there are several options available to submit your application through grants.gov to nih and department of health and human services partners. you must use one of these submission options to access the application forms for this opportunity.background:to facilitate the cooperation and partnering of public and private funding organizations, universities, academic medical centers, research institutes, contract research organizations, biotechnology companies, and pharmaceutical companies, ninds has formed the neurology network of excellence in clinical trials (neuronext, www.neuronext.org). neuronext has a clinical coordinating center (ccc), a data coordinating center (dcc) and a group of 25 geographically distributed clinical sites in the united states.this foa provides one of two different means by which teams of investigators can gain access to the neuronext infrastructure. this foa uses the u01 cooperative agreement mechanism and is open to all eligible applicants, as defined in section iii. small businesses may wish to consider applying through par-21-224) "neuronext small business innovation in clinical trials (u44)" or its reissues.purpose/research objectives:this clinical research network develops and conducts multiple, scientifically sound, possibly biomarker-informed exploratory clinical trials evaluating the most promising therapies, whether from academic, foundation or industry discoveries. examples include phase 2 clinical trials and clinical research studies aimed at validating biomarkers and clinical outcomes in preparation for clinical trials. neuronext provides a robust, standardized, and accessible infrastructure to facilitate rapid development and implementation of protocols in neurological disorders affecting adult and/or pediatric populations. while the network is not specific to one disease, it has the capacity to coordinate a cadre of specialist investigators to implement studies efficiently in response to disease-specific opportunities.the network is designed to increase the efficiency of clinical trials, to facilitate patient recruitment and retention, to increase the quality of neuroscience clinical trials, and to enable public-private partnerships.to foster the development of clinical trialists, the neuronext investigators who have been selected for their experience and training in neurological clinical research will provide a source of strong mentorship and support to investigators who are early in their careers as approved studies are implemented within the infrastructure.specific areas of research interest:this foa encourages applications for exploratory clinical trials of investigational agents (drugs, biologics, surgical therapies or devices) that may contribute to the justification for and provide the data required for designing a future trial, for biomarker validation studies, or for proof of mechanism clinical studies. applications for drugs or biologics should provide compelling scientific evidence that the investigational agent proposed for study will reach/act upon the designated target or that its mechanism of action is such that it is expected to be of benefit in ameliorating a specific aspect of the disease. neurologic diseases chosen for study must fall within the primary responsibility of ninds (www.ninds.nih.gov/funding/areas/index.htm).examples of appropriate studies under this foa include, but are not limited to, those designed to:a separate clinical trials network has been established and funded by ninds to conduct clinical trials and biomarker studies for stroke treatment, prevention and recovery; thus neuronext has been established for the conduct of studies in neurological disorders other than stroke. multi-site studies in stroke prevention, treatment and/or recovery are not appropriate for this foa; those studies would be considered by nih strokenet: http://www.nihstrokenet.org/. separate clinical trial networks also exist for the conduct of studies in neurological emergencies (siren: https://siren.network/) and pain (eppic-net: https://www.ninds.nih.gov/current-research/trans-agency-activities/ninds-role-heal-initiative/ninds-role-heal-initiative-eppic). studies on these topics should be directed to the dedicated networks. studies primarily focused on biomarker validation may also apply to one of the ninds biomarker funding opportunities https://www.ninds.nih.gov/current-research/focus-tools-topics/biomarkers.phase 1 clinical trials should be directed to the exploratory clinical trial foa (par-18-420 and par-18-617). phase 1b/2a trials requiring multi-center implementation can be considered under this foa.implementationapplicants should make note of the following:(1) applicants to this foa will be required to incorporate the neuronext infrastructure (www.neuronext.org) into their proposed study. additional (ad-hoc) sites may be proposed to fulfill specific study requirements, if a compelling justification exists. all applicants will be required to use the master clinical trial agreements and central irb that have been established for neuronext.(2) efficacy: this foa is not intended to support the conduct of a clinical trial where the primary aim is to confirm efficacy of a drug or biologic.(3) secondary aims:for drugs and biologics, issues of study feasibility and refinement of study procedures may be addressed as secondary aims in an exploratory clinical trial. examples of such secondary aims include, but are not limited to, the following:for medical device, early feasibility or traditional feasibility studies, issues of study feasibility and refinement of study procedures are expected to be addressed as primary aims in addition to providing initial clinical safety data at this stage. these may include:(4) the nih recognizes that devices can vary greatly in terms of basic form and function, physiological bases for therapy, degree of invasiveness, etc. consequently, the appropriate pathway to market may require a traditional feasibility and pivotal study in support of an eventual pre-market approval submission, or may require a more limited study to address specific issues in support of an fda 510(k) or 510(k) de novo submission. clinical studies involving devices may utilize the entire neuronext network, or a more limited subset of centers selected based on appropriate expertise for the given device. investigators are encouraged to contact ninds program staff as early as possible to discuss how the neuronext network may best be utilized in support of their specific device project. ninds anticipates that the majority of device projects utilizing neuronext will be traditional feasibility studies in order to best leverage the advantages of the network. an early feasibility study should be designed in accordance with fda’s draft guidance, “investigational device exemptions (ide) for early feasibility medical device clinical studies, including certain first in human (fih) studies”, see https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/investigational-device-exemptions-ides-early-feasibility-medical-device-clinical-studies-including to allow for early clinical evaluation of devices to provide proof of principle and initial clinical safety data while device design and operations are still in development. a traditional feasibility study is a clinical investigation that is commonly used to capture preliminary safety and effectiveness information on a near-final or final device design to adequately plan a pivotal study.early feasibility and traditional feasibility study designs may include single-arm case series, on-off interventions (patients as own controls), device-device comparisons, comparisons to historic controls, comparisons to performance controls, or adaptive/bayesian designs.(5) rare diseases: applications in rare diseases are encouraged while recognizing that available patient pools may not be adequate to meet the sample size requirements normally required to establish the efficacy of an intervention. ninds acknowledges that innovative, non-traditional trial designs including adaptive designs may be appropriate in rare disease studies. regardless of the design it is especially important to ensure that the study design and statistical analysis plans will meet the stated objectives and allow for the most efficient evaluation of the limited subjects. the application should clearly demonstrate recruitment feasibility at the participating sites and applicants are encouraged to fully engage patient advocacy groups or similar representatives of the affected disease community in study design, execution, and reporting. while neuronext is primarily intended for exploratory trials, the network will consider phase 2/3 trials in diseases with a us prevalence of under 5,000 persons.(6) rationale: exploratory trials primarily test hypotheses in relatively small programs so that the acceptable risk and uncertainty are higher than in later stage programs. exploratory clinical trials must anchor their rationale in (1) an unmet medical need; (2) a plausible biological mechanism; (3) non-clinical (in vitro and/or in vivo) data; and/or (4) early clinical data. their individual weight should be carefully assessed in the specific context of the application at hand. there is no requirement to provide support from all four areas. however, supporting data should be robust enough to justify the proposed phase of study. applicants should consider the limitations of those studies with regards to the scientific rigor guidelines published by ninds (see https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/not-ns-11-023.html). preclinical data (such as from animal studies) that do not sufficiently meet the rigor guidelines or are not sufficiently associated with the human condition may be inadequate to support the rationale for the study.(7) pharmacometrics: applications seeking to obtain data needed for pharmacometric modeling are encouraged, with the ultimate aim of enabling the optimal design of a future efficacy trial of an intervention.(8) the award and continuation of funding are subject to milestones to be specified in the notice of grant award according to ninds policies.(9) nih resources: as appropriate, applicants are encouraged to make use of the following resources for clinical research including:(a) clinical and translational science award (ctsa) program (https://ncats.nih.gov/ctsa);(b) neuroqol (http://www.neuroqol.org);(c) nih toolbox (http://www.nihtoolbox.org);(d) promis (http://www.nihpromis.org); and(e) ninds common data elements (http://www.commondataelements.ninds.nih.gov).(10) mobile technologies: applicants are encouraged to consider utilizing (at least experimentally) mobile technologies to facilitate data collection and protocol adherence on the part of research participants and study site staff.(11) for biomarker validation studies, biomarkers are defined as a characteristic that is measured as an indicator of normal biological processes, pathogenic processes, or responses to an exposure or intervention, including therapeutic interventions. categories of biomarkers include: susceptibility/risk, diagnostic, monitoring, prognostic, predictive, pharmacodynamic/response, and safety. biomarker studies should define their intended context of use (a statement that fully and clearly describes the way the biomarker will be used in future clinical trials).working with neuronext is a cooperative venture between ninds, the neuronext network and the applicant. ninds will provide guidance to potential applicants with input from ninds program staff and the neuronext executive committee. potential applicants are strongly encouraged to contact ninds scientific/research contacts (see agency contacts, section vii) in order to discuss the feasibility of conducting the proposed trial through the neuronext infrastructure before submitting an application. pre-application consultation may include an introductory teleconference (at least 3 months prior to submission), followed by a conference call or in-person meeting with ninds staff, as needed.funding decisions will also be based on a study's fit for the network relative to other proposed and ongoing trials.clinical trial applications that do not include the appropriate documentation listed in section 4.5 of the human subjects andclinical trials information form will be withdrawn and not reviewed. prior to grant award, awardees who do not have an exemption from the fda must provide any additional fda correspondence regarding the status of the protocol to the ninds, especially if the trial has been placed under full or partial hold.see section viii. other information for award authorities and regulations.see section viii. other information for award authorities and regulations.cooperative agreement: a support mechanism used

followed, with the following additional instructions:specific aims: applicants should describe the potential impact of the proposed research. the hypotheses and specific aims of the trial must be clearly and concisely stated. the primary and secondary outcomes to be measured must be defined. the inclusion of secondary aims should be justified by describing the importance of the supportive or explanatory data.research strategy:significance and biological relevanceapplicants must state concisely the need, rationale, timeliness, and scientific relevance of the proposed study. it is particularly important that there be a discussion of how the study will test the hypothesis proposed and how results of the study (positive or negative) may be explained based on the biological action of the proposed intervention. the application must present an overview of the state of the science, current status of therapeutics for the disease, and relevance of the trial. the applicant should also discuss the place of the proposed trial in the development pipeline of therapeutic interventions for the targeted disease. the timeliness of the proposed study should be discussed in the application.potential impact of the trial: applicants should also include a description of the potential impact of the proposed research on clinical care - regardless of the results - and estimate the public health impact relative to the number of afflicted individuals in the u.s. and/or global population annually.for other studies, such as biomarker studies, the above instructions still apply, and the description should emphasize the specific need and potential impact for diagnosis, therapy development, etc. as appropriate.prior studies and rationale for developmentexploratory clinical trials must anchor their rationale in (1) an unmet medical need; (2) a plausible biological mechanism; (3) non-clinical (in vitro and/or in vivo) data; and/or (4) early clinical data. their individual weight should be carefully assessed in the specific context of the application at hand; the applicant is not required to provide support from all four areas. the major findings of the studies, whether pre-clinical or clinical, that led to the proposed clinical trial should provide a compelling rationale for the belief that the proposed intervention may be effective. data from pre-clinical and pilot studies demonstrating the need for and the feasibility of the trial should be presented when available. while the ninds recognizes that informative animal models are not available for many neurological disorders, the applicant should specifically address the rigor of any animal studies being used as support (https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/not-ns-11-023.html). clinical data may include strong epidemiological evidence, but this is typically regarded as hypothesis-generating only. applicants should describe the full body of evidence being used to support the proposed study and comment on the justification for moving forward with the proposed clinical study. applications for drugs or biologics should provide compelling scientific evidence that the investigational agent proposed for study will reach/act upon the designated target or that its mechanism of action is such that it is expected to be of benefit in ameliorating a specific aspect of the disease. if a drug or biologic is to be used, the applicant should provide evidence of access to and permission to use the drug or biologic.approachapplicants should provide a brief description of their proposed study, including a discussion of the potential biases in the study and how they will be addressed. a study protocol synopsis should be included, and applicants should work with the neuronext team and the ninds to develop a detailed protocol. minor refinements and operational changes can be made after peer review if needed. the neuronext infrastructure has been established by ninds based on peer- and council review to form a group of outstanding clinical trial experts from the field of neurology and statistics with a proven record of developing high quality protocols.letter of support: if there will be subcontracts or service agreements for personnel or facilities, include documentation of such commitments, co-signed by a business official and the investigator at the participating

be evaluated for completeness and compliance with application instructions by the center for scientific review, nih. applications that are incomplete or non-compliant will be withdrawn.requests of $500,000 or more for direct costs in any yearapplicants requesting $500,000 or more in direct costs in any year (excluding consortium f&a) must contact a scientific/ research contact at least 6 weeks before submitting the application and follow the policy on the acceptance for review of unsolicited applications that request $500,000 or more in direct costs as described in the sf424 (r&r) application guide.applicants are required to follow the instructions for post-submission materials, as described in the policy. any instructions provided here are in addition to the instructions in the policy.note: effective for due dates on or after january 25, 2023, the data sharing plan and genomic data sharing plan (gds) as part of the resource sharing plan will not be evaluated at time of review.only the review criteria described below will be considered in the review process. applications submitted to the nih in support of the nih mission are evaluated for scientific and technical merit through the nih peer review system.for this particular announcement, note the following:1. approved projects will be implemented through the neuronext infrastructure and will make use of previously approved sites, resources, and investigators at the neuronext clinical coordinating center, data coordinating center, and clinical sites. the applicant will work closely with the neuronext investigators who have been selected for their experience and training in neurological clinical research. while some applicants will be relatively junior in their careers, neuronext provides a cadre of experienced clinical trial experts who can ensure high quality implementation and oversight of studies. the pd(s)/pi(s) therefore do not need to bring as much clinical research experience as they would have to bring to a non-neuronext project.the neuronext infrastructure (ccc, dcc and clinical hubs) was selected following peer review to provide an optimal environment and mechanism for conducting relevant projects, including centralized clinical trial management, data management, and oversight of activities at clinical centers.2. exploratory clinical trials must anchor their rationale in (1) an unmet medical need; (2) a plausible biological mechanism; (3) non-clinical (in vitro and/or in vivo) data; and/or (4) early clinical data. their individual weight should be carefully assessed in the specific context of the application at hand; the applicant is not required to provide support from all four areas. reviewers will focus on the overall impact of the study which will also include the evaluation of the experimental design and all of the review criteria described belowin addition, for applications involving clinical trials: a proposed clinical trial application may include study design, methods, and intervention that are not by themselves innovative but address important questions or unmet needs. additionally, the results of the clinical trial may indicate that further clinical development of the intervention is unwarranted or lead to new avenues of scientific investigation.reviewers will provide an overall impact score to reflect their assessment of the likelihood for the project to exert a sustained, powerful influence on the research field(s) involved, in consideration of the following review criteria and additional review criteria (as applicable for the project proposed).reviewers will consider each of the review criteria below in the determination of scientific merit, and give a separate score for each. an application does not need to be strong in all categories to be judged likely to have major scientific impact. for example, a project that by its nature is not innovative may be essential to advance a field.does the project address an important problem or a critical barrier to progress in the field? is the prior research that serves as the key support for the proposed project rigorous? if the aims of the project are achieved, how will scientific knowledge, technical capability, and/or clinical practice be improved? how will successful completion of the aims change the concepts, methods, technologies, treatments, services, or preventative interventions that drive this field?how compelling is the justification for the development of the proposed intervention in terms of potential advances in clinical practice, public health, and/or patient quality of life? how convincing is the evidence that equipoise exists in the medical and patient communities and the intervention is ready for clinical development?is the proposed project likely to yield the answers needed to proceed to the next step in developing the intervention? . is it clear why the proposed exploratory trial is essential to inform the design and implementation of a subsequent efficacy trial, or enable a “go/no-go” decision regarding further clinical development of the intervention? is there compelling justification for the development of the proposed intervention in terms of potential advances in clinical practice, public health, unmet medical need, and/or patient quality of life? is the potential impact of the intervention on the disease and patients clear? would the project advance the field even if the trial is negative?does the proposed trial have the potential to advance the field (e.g., by evaluating a new target mechanism, or by advancing the validation of a biological or clinical outcome) even if (a) the proposed study design, methods, and intervention are not innovative, and/or (b) the results of the trial indicate that further clinical development of the intervention is unwarranted?in addition, for applications involving clinical trialsare the scientific rationale and need for a clinical trial to test the proposed hypothesis or intervention well supported by preliminary data, clinical and/or preclinical studies, or information in the literature or knowledge of biological mechanisms? for trials focusing on clinical or public health endpoints, is this clinical trial necessary for testing the safety, efficacy or effectiveness of an intervention that could lead to a change in clinical practice, community behaviors or health care policy? for trials focusing on mechanistic, behavioral, physiological, biochemical, or other biomedical endpoints, is this trial needed to advance scientific understanding?are the pd(s)/pi(s), collaborators, and other researchers well suited to the project? if early stage investigators or those in the early stages of independent careers, do they have appropriate experience and training? if established, have they demonstrated an ongoing record of accomplishments that have advanced their field(s)? if the project is collaborative or multi-pd/pi, do the investigators have complementary and integrated expertise; are their leadership approach, governance and organizational structure appropriate for the project?do the key investigators have the ability to work with the neuronext infrastructure for the clinical activities, study coordination, data management and analysis, and other relevant study activities?in addition, for applications involving clinical trialswith regard to the proposed leadership for the project, do the pd/pi(s) and key personnel have the expertise, experience, and ability to organize, manage and implement the proposed clinical trial and meet milestones and timelines? do they have appropriate expertise in study coordination, data management and statistics? for a multicenter trial, is the organizational structure appropriate and does the application identify a core of potential center investigators and staffing for a coordinating center?does the application challenge and seek to shift current research or clinical practice paradigms by utilizing novel theoretical concepts, approaches or methodologies, instrumentation, or interventions? are the concepts, approaches or methodologies, instrumentation, or interventions novel to one field of research or novel in a broad sense? is a refinement, improvement, or new application of theoretical concepts, approaches or methodologies, instrumentation, or interventions proposed?in addition, for applications involving clinical trialsdoes the design/research plan include innovative elements, as appropriate, that enhance its sensitivity, potential for information or potential to advance scientific knowledge or clinical practice?are the overall strategy, methodology, and analyses well-reasoned and appropriate to accomplish the specific aims of the project? have the investigators included plans to address weaknesses in the rigor of prior research that serves as the key support for the proposed project? have the investigators presented strategies to ensure a robust and unbiased approach, as appropriate for the work proposed? are potential problems, alternative strategies, and benchmarks for success presented? if the project is in the early stages of development, will the strategy establish feasibility and will particularly risky aspects be managed? have the investigators presented adequate plans to address relevant biological variables, such as sex, for studies in vertebrate animals or human subjects?if the project involves human subjects and/or nih-defined clinical research, are the plans to address 1) the protection of human subjects from research risks, and 2) inclusion (or exclusion) of individuals on the basis of sex/gender, race, and ethnicity, as well as the inclusion or exclusion of individuals of all ages (including children and older adults), justified in terms of the scientific goals and research strategy proposed?are the study documents (e.g., protocol, consent, investigator's brochure) adequate to allowing the implementation of a high quality study? do the study documents comply with good clinical practice (gcp)?how well does the project leverage the use of existing nih tools, ninds networks, and/or other resources?while the nih neuronext environment has already undergone peer review and is fully established, the following issues should be considered with respect to each application: have the sites provided adequate or reasonable estimates of the number of patients that they expect to be able to enroll? does this project include a partnership with the private sector (e.g. patient groups and/or industry), and if so, have agreements with proposed partners been established? have any foreign organizations involved in the proposed study documented the compatibility of their data collection methods with u.s. data collection methods? is there evidence that the study drug or device will be available in sufficient quantities to ensure feasibility of the project? are substantive letters of support or other documentation provided to assure commitment of subcontractors, consultants, and/or service agreements for personnel and facilities?in

decisions:information regarding the disposition of applications is available in the nih grants policy statement.if the application is under consideration for funding, nih will request "just-in-time" information from the applicant as described in the nih grants policy statement.a formal notification in the form of a notice of award (noa) will be provided to the applicant organization for successful applications. the noa signed by the grants management officer is the authorizing document and will be sent via email to the recipient's business official.awardees must comply with any funding restrictions described in section iv.5. funding restrictions. selection of an application for award is not an authorization to begin performance. any costs incurred before receipt of the noa are at the recipient's risk. these costs may be reimbursed only to the extent considered allowable pre-award costs.any application awarded in response to this foa will be subject to terms and conditions found on the award conditions and information for nih grants website. this includes any recent legislation and policy applicable to awards that is highlighted on this website.individual awards are based on the application submitted to, and as approved by, the nih and are subject to the ic-specific terms and conditions identified in the noa.clinicaltrials.gov: if an award provides for one or more clinical trials. by law (title viii, section 801 of public law 110-85), the "responsible party" must register and submit results information for certain “applicable clinical trials” on the clinicaltrials.gov protocol registration and results system information website (https://register.clinicaltrials.gov). nih expects registration and results reporting of all trials whether required under the law or not. for more information, see https://grants.nih.gov/policy/clinical-trials/reporting/index.htminstitutional review board or independent ethics committee approval: recipient institutions must ensure that all protocols are reviewed by their irb or iec. to help ensure the safety of participants enrolled in nih-funded studies, the awardee must provide nih copies of documents related to all major changes in the status of ongoing protocols.data and safety monitoring requirements: the nih policy for data and safety monitoring requires oversight and monitoring of all nih-conducted or -supported human biomedical and behavioral intervention studies (clinical trials) to ensure the safety of participants and the validity and integrity of the data. further information concerning these requirements is found at http://grants.nih.gov/grants/policy/hs/data_safety.htm and in the application instructions (sf424 (r&r) and phs 398).investigational new drug or

defense authorization act of fiscal year 2009 (public law 110-417), nih awards will be subject to the federal awardee performance and integrity information system (fapiis) requirements. fapiis requires federal award making officials to review and consider information about an applicant in the designated integrity and performance system (currently fapiis) prior to making an award. an applicant, at its option, may review information in the designated integrity and performance systems accessible through fapiis and comment on any information about itself that a federal agency previously entered and is currently in fapiis. the federal awarding agency will consider any comments by the applicant, in addition to other information in fapiis, in making a judgement about the applicant’s integrity, business ethics, and record of performance under federal awards when completing the review of risk posed by applicants as described in 45 cfr part 75.205 “federal awarding agency review of risk posed by applicants.” this provision will apply to all nih grants and cooperative agreements except fellowships.the following special terms of award are in addition to, and not in lieu of, otherwise applicable omb administrative guidelines, hhs grant administration regulations at 45 cfr parts 75, and other hhs, phs, and nih grant administration policies.the administrative and funding instrument used for this program will be the cooperative agreement, an "assistance" mechanism (rather than an "acquisition" mechanism), in which substantial nih programmatic involvement with the recipients is anticipated during the performance of the activities. under the cooperative agreement, the nih purpose is to support and stimulate the recipients' activities by involvement in and otherwise working jointly with the award recipients in a partnership role; it is not to assume direction, prime responsibility, or a dominant role in the activities. consistent with this concept, the dominant role and prime responsibility resides with the recipientsfor the project as a whole, although specific tasks and activities may be shared among the recipientsand the nih as defined below.the pd(s)/pi(s) will have the primary responsibility for:defining of research objectives and approaches, planning, conducting, analyzing, and publishing results, interpretations, and conclusion of their studies and for providing overall scientific and administrative leadership for the research project.supervising of the clinical study with consistent emphasis on collaborative interactions between investigators, advisory and steering committees, and ninds representatives.interacting with the neuronext clinical coordinating center and the neuronext data coordinating center as well as any ad hoc sites.acquiring an ind from the fda if an investigational agent is to be used,acting as a member of the neuronext steering committee for the duration of the study with possible participation in steering groups for planning, quality control, capitation, publications etc.awardees will retain custody of and have primary rights to data and software developed under this award, subject to government rights of access consistent with current dhhs, phs, and nih policies.ninds staff will have substantial programmatic involvement that is above and beyond the normal stewardship role in awards, as described below:ninds staff involvement will include oversight of the irb approved protocol by the ninds program official, documentation of adequate serious adverse event management and reporting, and regular communications with the principal investigator and staff; additional involvement generally includes participation in meetings of the steering committee and other leadership committees. specifically:an ninds project scientist working with the network investigators will develop milestones for the study. failure to meet the agreed upon milestones may result in reduced funding or early termination of the cooperative agreement. the ninds retains the option to obtain periodic external peer review of progress.the ninds project scientist will function as one of several co-investigators, collaborating and interacting as necessary with the principal investigators in accomplishing the overall goals of the research program.in addition, an ninds program official will be responsible for the normal scientific and programmatic stewardship of the award and will be named in the award notice.a separate ninds program official, from the office of clinical research, will serve as the ninds liaison to the data and safety monitoring board,if it is determined that a dsmb is needed for the study.if the proposed trial should require that fda issue an ind, the ninds project scientist and/or program official(s) will be present at any meetings held with the fda related to this nih-funded protocol.as with any award, even during the period recommended for support, continuation is conditional upon satisfactory progress. if, at any time, recruitment falls significantly below the projected milestones for recruitment, the ninds will consider ending support and negotiating a phase-out of the award. the ninds retains the option to obtain periodic external peer review of progress. milestones will be established by the ninds prior to the award of the grant based on recommendations from the primary review group. ninds will make an award for 2 to 3 years in order to start-up the trial and establish performance feasibility. continuation of the award past this feasibility period will be contingent upon a demonstrated ability to meet milestones indicating that the trial can be implemented as planned. feasibility milestones will be defined at the start of each trial and will be monitored closely by the institute-appointed data and safety monitoring board (dsmb) and ninds program official. achievement of these milestones will be evaluated by ninds prior to releasing funding for each year of the award and failure to achieve these milestones may lead to study termination.areas of joint responsibility include:none; all responsibilities are divided between awardees and nih staff as described above.dispute resolution:any disagreements that may arise in scientific or programmatic matters (within the scope of the award) between award recipients and the nih may be brought to dispute resolution. a dispute resolution panel composed of three members will be convened. it will have three members: a designee of the steering committee chosen without nih staff voting, one nih designee, and a third designee with expertise in the relevant area who is chosen by the other two; in the case of individual disagreement, the first member may be chosen by the individual awardee. this special dispute resolution procedure in no way affects the awardee's right to appeal an adverse action that is otherwise appealable in accordance with phs regulations 42 cfr part 50, subpart d and hhs regulations 45 cfr part 16.data management and sharingnote: the nih policy for data management and sharing is effective for due dates on or after january 25, 2023.consistent
