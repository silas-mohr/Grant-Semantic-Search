mortality constitute a serious health crisis in the u.s., with an estimated 700 maternal deaths each year from conditions related to or associated with pregnancy or childbirth and over 50,000 women experiencing severe maternal morbidity (smm).to prevent the occurrence or advancement of diseases associated with pregnancy and to improve the health of pregnant and postpartum women, early identification of those who are at risk for mmm is needed. this identification of risk could be done in clinical settings to inform treatment and prevention approaches and/or in-home settings using continuous monitoring to alert clinicians or patients about potential risks and encourage prevention and treatment steps in real time.over the past few years, significant advances have been made in the discovery of biomarker signatures to identify risk for mmm, including those for biological and behavioral states related to disease prevention and identification. many of these advances have been made because of the development of new and improved imaging, genetic, mobile, and machine learning technologies. additionally, the development of devices that can measure such biomarkers at the point of care (poc) or in wearable fashion have become common place.it now appears feasible to develop clinical tools that can measure biomarkers or surrogate markers for mmm. such an objective tool would allow for improved clinical mmm research, prevention, and treatment. currently, there is an urgent need for personalized treatment options for pregnant women at risk for mmm. however, mmm research and diagnosis are hampered due to the lack of technology to measure these objective predictors of risk for mmm in a poc or wearable continuous monitoring fashion for early detection. quality research and treatment require quantitative measurement; these tools could improve the prevention and treatment of mmm.research objectivesthis nosi is intended to encourage interest in the small business community to develop various approaches, technologies, and tools to address the health issues of maternal morbidity and mortality by achieving a wide array of outcomes, such as 1) the identification, phenotyping, subtyping, and stratification of patients at a greater risk of mmm, 2) multi-level interventions to address racial disparities in mmm, and 3) clinical decision-making that considers social and cultural biases.furthermore, this nosi focuses on the development and validation of tools, technologies, and approaches, including artificial intelligence (ai) and machine learning, that indicate states of increased risk for and presence of mmm. this includes but is not limited to development of tools and technologies that:technologies that are affordable, scalable, and easy to implement within a variety of clinical settings, including primary care, will maximize the benefit to the patient population. moreover, technologies that take social and cultural norms into the design consideration to maximize adoption by the patient population are of critical importance. these devices could be used at the point of care or in-home settings, where these devices could be worn by pre- and post-partum women and/or health-care providers when there is increasing risk. due to the many recent advances in monitoring devices to predict health conditions by measuring behavioral and biomarkers, this nosi is particularly interested in the development of new technologies that can combine different behavioral and biomarker measurements.national human genome research institute (nhgri)nhgri supports the development of resources, approaches, and technologies that accelerate and support studies focused on the structure and biology of genomes; the genomics of disease; the implementation and effectiveness of genomic medicine; genomic data science and bioinformatics; training, developing, and expanding the diversity of the genomics workforce; and ethical, legal, and social issues related to genomic advances. more details about the institute’s vision and priority areas can be found in the 2020 nhgri strategic vision (https://www.genome.gov/2020sv).examples of

health and to reduce, eliminate or prevent disparities in maternal mortality and morbidity experienced by racial and ethnic minority women compared to white women. when developing new technologies, including artificial intelligence and machine learning, the diverse voices of underserved women need to be included to mitigate unintended consequences and prevent exacerbation of disparities. the health of racial and ethnic minority women and the excess burden of maternal mortality and morbidity experienced result from factors operating within and across multiple domains (e.g., biological, behavioral, socio-cultural, environmental, physical environment, healthcare system) and multiple levels (e.g., individual, interpersonal, community, societal) (see the nimhd research framework).projects leading to commercially available, affordable, accessible and culturally acceptable technologies disrupting or preventing the interactions and processes responsible for or implicated in the creating, promoting or sustaining these and associated disparities are encouraged. projects examining social determinants of health and informed by the nimhd research framework are encouraged. projects that leverage the capabilities of design thinking or similar systems or societal level thinking are encouraged. projects employing teams with expertise across two or more domains
