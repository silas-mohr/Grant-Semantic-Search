additional information on eligibility.the purpose of this alzheimer’s disease-related dementia (adrd) initiative is to promote the development and distribution of innovative technologies, methods, protocols, and biomedical materials that enhance combined human neuropathology and neuroimaging research with data aimed at understanding the underlying pathophysiology of in vivo imaging results typically associated with vascular contributions to cognitive impairment and dementia (vcid) in tbi-related dementia and other adrd diagnoses.resources developed under this foa must follow open data sharing practices and are intended to expand the broader research community’s capacity to perform research aimed at neuropathologically-informed understanding of the vascular pathophysiology of clinically-relevant, in vivo neuroimaging findings.not applicableall applications are due by 5:00 pm local time of applicant organization.applicants are encouraged to apply early to allow adequate time to make any corrections to errors found in the application during the submission process by the due date.no late applications will be accepted for this funding opportunity announcement.not applicableit is critical that applicants follow the instructions in the research (r) instructions in the sf424 (r&r) application guide, except where instructed to do otherwise (in this foa or in a notice from nih guide for grants and contracts).conformance to all requirements (both in the application guide and the foa) is required and strictly enforced. applicants must read and follow all application instructions in the application guide as well as any program-specific instructions noted in section iv. when the program-specific instructions deviate from those in the application guide, follow the program-specific instructions.applications that do not comply with these instructions may be delayed or not accepted for review.background:subclinical brain magnetic resonance imaging (mri) findings of presumed vascular origin, such as white matter hyperintensities, and those that have the appearance of infarcts, microbleeds, and microinfarcts are frequently observed in alzheimer's disease (ad) and alzheimer’s disease-related dementia (adrd) patients, as well as seemingly healthy older adults. these findings are also associated with increased risk of cognitive impairment including dementia, physical disabilities, and clinical stroke. corresponding pathology findings are often first identified as incidental imaging findings or as part of a diagnostic workup for other neurological problems, such as headache or mild traumatic brain injury (tbi).despite the frequency of subclinical brain imaging findings of presumed vascular origin, little is known about how they relate to cerebrovascular and other brain pathologies either during life or postmortem. this foa aims to develop resources to help address this knowledge gap.under the 2011 national alzheimer’s projects act (napa), the first goal of the national plan to address alzheimer’s disease is to prevent and effectively treat adrds by 2025. starting in 2012, the national institute on aging (nia) and the national institute of neurological disorders and stroke (ninds) have held research summits triennially to assess research priorities and set research implementation milestones for the adrds, which include frontotemporal dementia (ftd), lewy body dementia (lbd), multiple etiology dementias (med), and vascular contributions to cognitive impairment and dementia (vcid). in 2019, traumatic brain injury (tbi) as a risk factor for the development of med was added as an emerging area of research interest for adrd.the ninds adrd summits in 2019 and 2022 resulted in the current adrd research priorities for advancing the state-of-the-science toward meeting goal 1 of the national plan.in line with these research priorities, a goal of ninds is to improve the understanding of the pathogenesis and underlying biology of vcid and tbi to advance prevention and treatment of dementia and improve public health.accordingly, in july of 2022 ninds held a workshop titled “imaging the future of in vivo neuropathological diagnosis through postmortem analyses” to better understand and bridge the gaps between in vivo imaging, ex vivo imaging, and neuropathology work, with the explicit end goal of improving in vivo diagnosis, primarily as it relates to tbi-related dementia and vcid. experts in neuropathology, magnetic resonance imaging, data analytics, tissue acquisition, image co-registration, and data standards, among several others, identified several methodological issues hindering the neuropathological study of tbi-related dementias, including chronic traumatic encephalopathy (cte) and vcid. these include long postmortem intervals that lead to morphological changes, fixation mediums and processes that distort ex vivo mr imaging, inappropriate block sampling due to irregular disease distribution patterns, and non-standard coordinate systems across institutes or studies. to address these issues, it will be necessary, for example, to include autopsy endpoints in observational studies and trials, perform timely in vivo and/or ex vivo mri to identify pathological tissue before blocking, and develop standardized in vivo and ex vivo atlases at various resolutions to facilitate co-registration between mri and neuropathology blocks.for solutions to these issues to be successful they need to be scalable and easy to disseminate to the relevant scientific communities. given the complexity of the work, there is also a need for these solutions to be addressed by multi-disciplinary and multi-site teams.specific research objectives:the purpose of this funding opportunity is to develop and share innovative technologies, methods, protocols, and biomedical materials that further enable the combined analysis of human neuropathology and neuroimaging data aimed at understanding the underlying pathophysiologies of vcid in tbi- and cte-related dementia and other ad/adrd diagnoses.resources developed are expected to provide tools and techniques to advance and expand community-wide research capacity for performing joint neuropathological and neuroimaging analysis. to accomplish the goal of expanding research capacity in neuropathologically-informed neuroimaging, it is expected that resources developed under this foa will demonstrate reproducibility and feasibility of use by the broader research community. applicants are also expected to focus on at least two resource development topics. resource development topics of interest include, but are not limited to:the resource development topics of interest are driven by the need to further understand the pathogenic processes associated with the varied subclinical mr imaging findings, at common field strengths, of presumed vascular origin seen during life of healthy elderly individuals, individuals who exhibit symptoms consistent with ad/adrd, and individuals with tbi-related dementia, including those with chronic traumatic encephalopathy cte. therefore, the topics of interest mentioned above are intended to address the need to understand the following:resource sharing:to advance the goal of strengthening fair (findable, accessible, interoperable, and re-usable) principles in data sharing, investigators will be expected to share resources developed under this foa, including but not limited to code/scripts, analytic tools/statistical models, protocols/processes and metadata, atlases, protocols, mr pulse sequences, hardware designs, and other technologies through open-access repositories. therefore, investigators are strongly encouraged to use open-source software, analytic tools, and programming languages to promote interoperability as well as reproducibility. in this way, the fair principles for data sharing and the rigor and reproducibility of research will be enhanced. applicants who plan to utilize data not currently in their possession (originated from another party) must confirm availability of the data and demonstrate (at a minimum via a letter of support) the willingness and permissibility of the original investigators to share the data for the purposes of the harmonization, curation, secondary analyses, in accordance with all applicable rules for the protection of human subjects.to ensure the maximal value of the project, ninds and nih common data elements (cdes) are expected to be used whenever applicable cdes exist. this includes reporting of neuropathological processes and results using the neuropathological cdes developed in early 2022 and the existing mr cdes. the neuroimaging cdes can be found at the ninds cde repository and federal interagency traumatic brain injury research informatics system (fitbir) website, whereas the neuropathology cdes are currently only available on the fitbir website.investigator teamproposals are expected to include a multidisciplinary team with expertise in data science/data standards, in vivo and postmortem (or ex vivo) human mr neuroimaging, human mr neuroimaging methods and data analysis, human neuropathology methods and data analysis, and vascular neurology. such a multidisciplinary, team-science strategy should encourage cross fertilization of knowledge and utilize appropriate subject matter expertise for interrogating data. further, ninds encourages applications from diverse teams of investigators, including team members that are from groups that are underrepresented in the biomedical, behavioral, or clinical research workforce.milestonesmilestones will be used to evaluate the application during both peer review and non-competing award years. it is expected that proposed timelines for achieving milestones be realistic, efficient, and include necessary steps. since these awards will be managed as cooperative agreements, projects that do not comply with terms, conditions, and established milestones of the award and of this program may be terminated prior to the project end-date.the nih program official will contact the applicant(s) to discuss the proposed milestones before the award. the ninds may require revisions to the study protocol and execution prior to the award. this includes modifications that may be needed after bringing applicants together to discuss proposed projects and associated milestones.‘administrative’ and ‘data coordination and dissemination’ plansall proposals awarded under this foa will be required to participate in an ninds-led consortium to ensure collaboration and consistency in data standard development within and between funded awards. accordingly, having administrative and data coordination and disemmination plans in place will work to ensure that multi-disciplinary, collaborative approaches are implemented once projects commence, that synergy exists between funded projects, that data are properly curated across projects, and that data are disseminated in a manner that facilitates use on a broad scale.administrative plan: this plan will serve to coordinate the integration and management of activities within each award, including reporting and establishing milestones, for example, and coordinating activities with the project teams of the other funded award(s) funded under this foa. doing so will help to facilitate communication among and across sites, discuss common approaches that can be taken between projects (e.g., agree on data, methods, and tissue processing and storage standards, where possible), and resolve any potential disagreements.data coordination and dissemination plan: this plan will serve several purposes. first, it will serve as a guide for the coordination, curation, and any potential external validation of data collected through the application as well as across projects funded under this foa. second, the plan will provide the details for the submission of all tbi-related data into the fitbir informatics platform, as well as submission of other data into a federal or non-federal database to comply with the nih data management and sharing policy (https://sharing.nih.gov/). third, it will serve to describe how the applicant will promote awareness of developed shared resources, innovative technologies, methods, biomedical materials, or other tools or techniques to advance and expand the community-wide research capacity for joint analysis.rigor and transparency:ninds, as part of nih, strives for rigor and transparency in all research it funds. for this reason, ninds explicitly emphasizes the nih application instructions related to rigor and transparency and provides additional guidance to the scientific community. for example, the biological rationale for the proposed experiments must be based on rigorous and robust supporting data, which means that data should be collected via methods that minimize the risk of bias and be reported in a transparent manner. if previously published or preliminary studies do not meet these standards, applicants should address how the current study design addresses the deficiencies in rigor and transparency. proposed experiments should likewise be designed in a manner that minimizes the risk of bias and ensures validity of experimental results.workforce diversity and health disparities:all applicants proposing human subjects research are encouraged to focus on the recruitment and inclusion of individuals from racial and ethnic minority health and nih-designated populations that experience health disparities and plans for doing so should be included in the application (see: https://grants.nih.gov/policy/inclusion.htm) and minority health and health disparities: definitions and parameters (nih.gov)). for all types of research proposals, ninds encourages applications from diverse teams of investigators, including team members that are from groups that are underrepresented in the biomedical, behavioral, or clinical research workforce. such individuals include those from underrepresented racial and ethnic groups, those with disabilities, and those from disadvantaged backgrounds (see: not-od-20-031: notice of nih's interest in diversity and reminder: notice of nih's encouragement of applications supporting individuals from underrepresented ethnic and racial groups as well as individuals with disabilities, not-od-22-019).non-responsive applications under this foa include:applications deemed not responsive to the foa will be withdrawn without review.see section viii. other information for award authorities and regulations.cooperative agreement: a support mechanism used when there will be substantial federal scientific or programmatic involvement. substantial involvement means that, after award, nih scientific or program staff will assist, guide, coordinate, or participate in project activities. see section vi.2 for additional information about the substantial involvement for this foa.the oer glossary and the sf424 (r&r) application guide provide details on these application types. only those application types listed here are allowed for this foa.not allowed: only accepting applications that do not propose clinical trials.need help determining whether you are doing a clinical trial?nih intends to commit to

include the nih grants policy statement as part of the noa. for these terms of award, see the nih grants policy statement part ii: terms and conditions of nih grant awards, subpart a: general and part ii: terms and conditions of nih grant awards, subpart b: terms and conditions for specific types of grants, recipients, and activities, including of note, but not limited to:if a recipient is successful and receives a notice of award, in accepting the award, the recipient agrees that any activities under the award are subject to all provisions currently in effect or implemented during the period of the award, other department regulations and policies in effect at the time of the award, and applicable statutory provisions.should the applicant organization successfully compete for an award, recipients of federal financial assistance (ffa) from hhs must administer their programs in compliance with federal civil rights laws that prohibit discrimination on the basis of race, color, national origin, disability, age and, in some circumstances, religion, conscience, and sex (including gender identity, sexual orientation, and pregnancy). this includes ensuring programs are accessible to persons with limited english proficiency and persons with disabilities. the hhs office for civil rights provides guidance on complying with civil rights laws enforced by hhs. please see https://www.hhs.gov/civil-rights/for-providers/provider-obligations/index.html and https://www.hhs.gov/civil-rights/for-individuals/nondiscrimination/index.htmlhhs recognizes that research projects are often limited in scope for many reasons that are nondiscriminatory, such as the principal investigator’s scientific interest, funding limitations, recruitment requirements, and other considerations. thus, criteria in research protocols that target or exclude certain populations are warranted where nondiscriminatory justifications establish that such criteria are appropriate with respect to the health or safety of the subjects, the scientific study design, or the purpose of the research. for additional guidance regarding how the provisions apply to nih grant programs, please contact the scientific/research contact that is identified in section vii under agency contacts of this foa.please contact the hhs office for civil rights for more information about obligations and prohibitions under federal civil rights laws at https://www.hhs.gov/ocr/about-us/contact-us/index.html or call 1-800-368-1019 or tdd 1-800-537-7697.in accordance with the statutory provisions contained in section 872 of the duncan hunter national defense authorization act of fiscal year 2009 (public law 110-417), nih awards will be subject to the federal awardee performance and integrity information system (fapiis) requirements. fapiis requires federal award making officials to review and consider information about an applicant in the designated integrity and performance system (currently fapiis) prior to making an award. an applicant, at its option, may review information in the designated integrity and performance systems accessible through fapiis and comment on any information about itself that a federal agency previously entered and is currently in fapiis. the federal awarding agency will consider any comments by the applicant, in addition to other information in fapiis, in making a judgement about the applicant’s integrity, business ethics, and record of performance under federal awards when completing the review of risk posed by applicants as described in 45 cfr part 75.205 and 2 cfr part 200.206 “federal awarding agency review of risk posed by applicants.” this provision will apply to all nih grants and cooperative agreements except fellowships.the following special terms of award are in addition to, and not in lieu of, otherwise applicable u.s. office of management and budget (omb) administrative guidelines, u.s. department of health and human services (dhhs) grant administration regulations at 45 cfr part 75 and 2 cfr part 200, and other hhs, phs, and nih grant administration policies.the administrative and funding instrument used for this program will be the cooperative agreement, an "assistance" mechanism (grant) (rather than an "acquisition" mechanism (contract)), in which two types of nih programmatic involvement with the awardees should be anticipated during the performance of the activities. under the cooperative agreement, the nih purpose is to support and stimulate the recipients' activities by involvement in and otherwise working jointly with the award recipients in a partnership role; it is not to assume direction, prime responsibility, or a dominant role in the activities. consistent with this concept, the dominant role and prime responsibility resides with the awardees for the project as a whole, although specific tasks and activities may be shared among the awardees and the nih as defined below.definitions:nih program officiala nih program official (po) will provide the standard programmatic oversight and stewardship of the projects, including review of pre-award and award documents/requirements, review of progress reports and budgets, approval of changes in scope, budget allocation or aims, and any other programmatic issues that may arise. the po will serve as an ex officio member of the external advisory committee.nih project coordinatorone or more nih program staff will serve as project coordinator (pc), to monitor progress in scientific aims, identify possible collaborations with other nih funded initiatives, review of milestones and other scientific issues, and oversee collaborative projects amongst recipientss. the pc will serve as a scientific representative of the nih to the investigators in accordance with policies and procedures of the cooperative agreement mechanism. the pc will provide nih scientific programmatic involvement with the recipient that is anticipated during the performance of the activities supported by this cooperative agreement, including review of milestones. the pc will work closely with the pd/pi to maximize progress towards the goals of the project and the program and will serve as a voting member of the external advisory committee.roles and responsibilities:the pd(s)/pi(s) will have the primary responsibility for the following activities:recipients will retain custody of and have primary rights to the data and software developed under these awards, subject to government rights of access consistent with current dhhs, phs, and nih policies.nih staff have substantial programmatic involvement that is above and beyond the normal stewardship role in awards, as described below:program official:project coordinator:areas of joint responsibility include:pd(s)/pi(s) will constitute the external advisory committee (eac) and this committee is expected to consist of individuals who are not key personnel or collaborators of the key personnel of the award. the eac meetings will include nih staff and may include the pd(s)/pi(s) and other members of the funded project. the eac will select one member to act as the chair of the committee and the chair may not be an nih employee. the eac will meet at least once a year.dispute resolution:any disagreements that may arise in scientific or programmatic matters (within the scope of the award) between award recipients and the nih may be brought to dispute resolution. a dispute resolution panel composed of three members will be convened. it will have three members: a designee of the eac chosen without nih staff voting, one nih designee, and a third designee with expertise in the relevant area who is chosen by the other two; in the case of individual disagreement, the first member may be chosen by the individual recipient. this special dispute resolution procedure does not alter the recipient's right to appeal an adverse action that is otherwise appealable in accordance with phs regulation 42 cfr part 50, subpart d and dhhs regulation 45 cfr part 16.3. data management and sharingnote: the nih policy for data management and sharing is effective for due dates on or after january 25, 2023.consistent with the nih policy for data management and sharing, when data management and sharing is applicable to the award, recipients will be required to adhere to

plan as described.for applications proposing the use of tbi-specific data, submission of data through the fitbir informatics platform will fulfill the requirements of the dms policy, but a dms plan must still be included. applicants who plan to utilize data not currently in their possession (originated from another party) must confirm availability of the data and demonstrate (at a minimum via a letter of support) the willingness and permissibility of the original investigators to share the data for the purposes of the harmonization, curation, secondary analyses, in accordance with all applicable rules for the protection of human subjects.4. reportingwhen multiple years are involved, recipients will be required to submit the research performance progress report (rppr) annually and financial statements as required in the nih grants policy statement.a final rppr, invention statement, and the expenditure data portion of the federal financial report are required for closeout of an award, as described in the nih grants policy statement. nih foas outline intended research goals and objectives. post award, nih will review and measure performance based on the details and outcomes that are shared within the rppr, as described at 45 cfr part 75.301 and 2 cfr part 200.301.the federal funding accountability and transparency act of 2006 (transparency act), includes a requirement for recipients of federal grants to report information about first-tier subawards and executive compensation under federal assistance awards issued in fy2011 or later. all recipients of applicable nih grants and cooperative agreements are required to report to the federal subaward reporting system (fsrs) available at www.fsrs.gov on all subawards over $25,000. see the nih grants policy statement
