institute of mental health (nimh)the purpose of this notice of special interest (nosi) is to communicate special interest in epidemiology investigations to quantify the impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) pandemic on human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) prevention, incidence, transmission, and outcomes. this nosi encourages research on the impact and strategies needed to adapt the hiv/aids response through agile and innovative support of prevention and care and the maintenance of sustained hiv viral suppression during the coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) pandemic.backgroundhiv infections in the united states continue to be a major public health concern. there are an estimated 1.2 million american people living with hiv (plwh), and 1 out of 8 people with hiv do not know they have it. hiv also remains one of the worldâ€™s most serious health and development challenges. the unaids 2019 report stated that there were 37.9 million plwh globally with 1.7 million new hiv diagnoses and 770,000 deaths associated with aids-related illness during that year. major global efforts have been mounted to address the hiv epidemic in the last 20 years and significant progress has been made. the number of people newly infected with hiv, and the number of deaths associated with aids-related illness have declined over the years, and the number of plwh receiving treatment increased to 25.4 million in 2019.challenges continue to complicate hiv control efforts. many plwh or at risk for hiv infection do not have access to prevention, treatment, and care, and there is still no cure. at best, hiv is a chronic disease requiring vigilance for ongoing effective prevention of infection and therapy to allay disease progression and deter the risk of ongoing hiv transmission. adherence to hiv medications is critical to maintain viral suppression while retention in care allows monitoring of resistance to therapies and changes in viral load and cd4 cell count. furthermore, hiv testing and access to preventive prep therapies are critical to efforts aimed at controlling the hiv epidemic.there is concern that the global covid-19 pandemic has disrupted hiv treatment and prevention programs in ways that will lead to a rise in hiv transmission and in turn produce new hiv outbreaks. while the full impact of covid-19 on hiv remains to be seen, it is estimated that such interruptions could result in many deaths related to hiv.recommendations to prevent severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2) exposure may interfere with ongoing and consistent care for persons with chronic hiv or exacerbate behavioral risks such as substance use. the economic impact, food and housing insecurity, fear of contracting a second potentially serious disease, misinformation and stigma may also prevent persons from seeking needed medical care. as global travel and transport are disrupted, drug supply chains may be jeopardized. medication shortages and delays for antiretroviral (arv) deliveries can have critical consequences for maintaining individual viral suppression in plwh and for prevention of ongoing hiv transmission.the current covid-19 pandemic has created a natural opportunity to explore, document, and quantify expected and unexpected consequences of a major world-wide disruption in hiv research, hiv prevention and treatment programs, and in the hiv continuum of care, clinical outcomes for plwh, and world-wide risk of new outbreaks of hiv infection.research objectivesthis nosi encourages research that can quantify and describe the impact of covid-19 acute and post-acute disease on the hiv/aids epidemic in the united states and worldwide. plwh may have systemic health disparities, co-morbidities, and socio-economic inequities that place them equally vulnerable to covid-19. public health mitigation efforts to control covid-19 may create barriers to care for plwh resulting in more severe disease and hospitalizations. this nosi encourages research that can address and quantify the complicated cascade of events resulting from an acute respiratory pandemic on the existing hiv/aids pandemic, and the need for vigilant care to treat and prevent hiv transmission and outbreaks of new infections. research into the interplay of protective effects, immunologic responses, and emergence of covid-19 variants in plwh is also needed.use of data science and epidemic modeling approaches such as forecasting with machine learning, analysis of electronic health records and other data sources, and modeling the complications of interruptions and disruptions in prevention and care are encouraged, as are investigations into local complications of health care burdens and barriers to hiv control.areas of interestniaid areas of interest:this nosi seeks to promote research in epidemiology; social and behavioral sciences; and hiv prevention and clinical care. areas of interest
