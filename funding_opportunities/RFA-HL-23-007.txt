september 22 and september 30, 2022see section iii. 3. additional information on eligibility.the purpose of the stimulating access to research in residency transition scholar (starrts) k38 career development program is to retain and support clinician investigators who have successfully completed the stimulating access to research in residency (starr) r38 program (rfa-hl-18-023 or rfa-hl-23-006) as resident-investigators. individuals who are awarded k38 grants described in this foa will be referred to as transition scholars. the intent of this foa is to provide transition scholars with opportunities for additional research and career development during subsequent clinical fellowship or early career faculty appointments (as defined in section iii. 3. additional information on eligibility). it is anticipated that the starrts k38 program will provide a pathway to retain the newly-created pool of clinician-investigators generated through the starr r38 program. transition scholar grantees will receive support for continued research and career development opportunities in basic, clinical and/or translational research thereby providing enhanced potential to accelerate the transition to independent research careers.this funding opportunity announcement (foa) is designed specifically for applicants proposing research that does not involve leading an independent clinical trial, a clinical trial feasibility study, or an ancillary study to a clinical trial. applicants to this foa are permitted to propose research experience in a clinical trial led by a mentor or co-mentor.not applicableall applications are due by 5:00 pm local time of applicant organization.applications are encouraged to apply early to allow adequate time to make any corrections to errors found in the application during the submission process by the due date.not applicablethere are several options available to submit your application through grants.gov to nih and department of health and human services partners. you must use one of these submission options to access the application forms for this opportunity.the overall goal of the nih research career development program is to help ensure that a diverse pool of highly trained scientists is available in appropriate scientific disciplines to address the nation's biomedical, behavioral, and clinical research needs. nih institutes and centers (ics) support a variety of mentored and non-mentored career development award programs designed to foster the transition of new investigators to research independence and to support established investigators in achieving specific objectives. candidates should review the different career development (k) award programs to determine the best program to support their goals. more information about career programs may be found at the nih extramural training mechanisms website.purposethe purpose of the stimulating access to research in residency transition scholar (starrts) k38 career development program is to retain and support clinician investigators who have successfully completed the stimulating access to research in residency (starr) r38 program (rfa-hl- 18-023 or rfa-hl-23-006) as resident-investigators. individuals who are awarded k38 grants described in this foa will be referred to as transition scholars. the intent of this foa is to provide transition scholars with opportunities for additional research and career development during subsequent clinical fellowship or early career faculty appointments (as defined in section iii. 3. additional information on eligibility). it is anticipated that the starrts k38 program will provide a pathway to retain the newly-created pool of clinician-investigators generated through the starr r38 program. transition scholars grantees will receive support for continued research and career development opportunities in basic, clinical and/or translational research thereby providing enhanced potential to accelerate the transition to independent research careers.this foa is intended to support only individuals who have successfully participated in the starr r38 program for at least 12, and up to 24 months. the starrts k38 transition scholar applicant can propose a research and career development plan at the same, or different department or institution as the institutional starr r38 research program in which he or she successfully participated. at the k38 transition scholar career stage, participants typically have clinical responsibilities in addition to research activities; for this reason, the proposed research activities should fall within an overall program structure consistent with appropriate medical board, dental or veterinary specialty eligibility.in general, research projects described in the starrts k38 application should fall within the mission of the nih institute/center which supported the starr r38 program in which the transition scholar applicant has successfully participated. in certain instances, with funds permitting, the programmatic management of the starrts k38 award may be transferred to another nih institute or center (ic) participating in the starr r38 program based on scientific content and according to established nih referral guidelines.backgroundthere is a critical workforce need for clinician-scientists/investigators, i.e., those with clinical experience who conduct research and offer skills and perspectives directly related to human health, disease conditions, clinical decision-making, diagnoses, prevention, and improving health outcomes. despite existing opportunities, relatively few physicians and other health professionals are pursuing research careers, and current opportunities may not maintain adequate numbers or diversity of clinician-scientists (acd physician scientist workforce report, 2014). the overall size of the current clinician-investigator workforce constitutes a small proportion of all nih-funded research investigators, and this is particularly true for early-stage clinician-investigators.novel strategies are needed to recruit, prepare, and retain more clinician-investigators from the large pool of potential researchers with health professional doctorates. among today’s nih-funded clinician-investigators, about 60% hold a single health professional degree and 40% hold both health professional and research doctorate degrees. women and individuals from underrepresented racial and ethnic groups represent a particularly low proportion of this workforce. each year in the united states, some 18,000 individuals earn an md, while 600 individuals earn md/phds; these data suggest that recruitment of even a slightly greater proportion of mds, and retention of more mds and md/phds in research careers, could significantly enhance the clinician-investigator workforce.providing significant research opportunities during post-doctoral clinical training periods may be one strategy to enhance the clinician-investigator workforce, yet the typical graduate medical education (“residency”) period offers limited opportunity to acquire the research skills and experience needed for a career as a clinician-investigator. to increase access to more in-depth research opportunities, several medical board-approved graduate medical residency programs have developed ‘fast track,’ ‘short track,’ ‘accelerated,’ or ‘research pathway’ approaches. these programs can support longer durations of protected research time, while meeting the residency clinical requirements approved by respective medical boards. available outcomes indicate that the clinical competency of pathway graduates is comparable to those participating in traditional residency training programs. many research pathway graduates subsequently hold positions in academic medicine, report research activity, and contribute substantial professional effort in research as clinician-investigators. however, most such programs do not offer substantive research opportunities during residency training.for health professionals who recognize the critical need to develop new understanding and therapeutic modalities for diseases, performing research during residency training can provide valuable experience and an early “on-ramp” to a research career. it is also recognized that many mds/health professionals as well as md/phds have had previous research experience, and research during residency provides an opportunity to build upon prior research experiences. the nih starr r38 program is designed to support institutional programs in facilitating unique and fulfilling research opportunities during residency training. building on successful completion of r38-supported research in residency, additional research and career development during fellowship or early-career faculty can offer starrts k38 transition scholars essential experience in experimental approaches and additional research experience needed to enhance retention in research and competitiveness for subsequent individual career development and research awards.the starrts k38 program is a limited competition for individuals who have successfully completed the program described in rfa-hl-18-023 stimulating access to research in residency (starr) r38 program. the starrts k38 award is designed to sustain and support a path toward a research career. nih anticipates that transition scholar starrts k38 awardees will continue research activity after the k38 project period ends. the future research activity may be supported by institutional or individual mentored career development awards (e.g., kl2, k12, k01, k08, k23, k76, k99) or independent research project grant awards (e.g., r01, r21), depending on research background and experience.program componentstransition scholar awards are intended to further research and career development by providing:awards include research development funds to cover the cost of research supplies and professional development activities that will contribute to the successful completion of research. such funds may be used for the following as appropriate for the proposed research career development plan:prospective transition scholars are strongly encouraged to contact the appropriate nih program official as soon as a plan to pursue a fellowship or a faculty position develops. for those candidates going into subspecialty clinical fellowship, the transition scholar candidate is responsible for an appropriately timed submission of an application that will align with the research phase of their fellowship program. a thorough assessment of appropriate application timing based on candidate readiness is particularly important for those transition scholar applicants who have not yet completed the minimum 12-month r38 starr program research requirements by submission date.transition scholars are encouraged to apply to the nih loan repayment program for qualified educational debt in return for research engagement, if eligibility criteria are met.specific areas of research interest of participating institutesthe participating nih institutes have provided a brief outline of their interests as they relate to the goals of this foa. these mission statements are intended to indicate the breadth of the biomedical areas of interest.the national institute on aging supports research to advance our understanding of the nature of aging and the aging process, as well as diseases and conditions associated with growing older, in order to extend the healthy, active years of life. nia’s division of aging biology supports molecular, cellular, and genetic research on the mechanisms of aging. the division of behavioral and social research supports social, behavioral, and economic research on the processes of aging at both the individual and societal level, including cross-disciplinary research, at multiple levels from genetics to cross-national comparative research, and at stages from basic through translational. the division of geriatrics and clinical gerontology supports clinical and translational research on health and disease in the aged, and research on aging over the human lifespan, including its relationships to health outcomes, with foci that include translational research for the development of new interventions for age-related conditions, prevention and treatment of multiple chronic conditions in the elderly, and studies that help to promote evidence-based geriatric care and inform policies affecting older adults. the division of neuroscience supports collaborative research to further the understanding of neural and behavioral processes associated with the aging brain. research on dementias of old age—in particular alzheimer’s disease—is one of the program’s highest priorities. note: the nia will support only investigators in clinical fellowship under this foa. investigators interested in research support as early career faculty are encouraged to consider nia's gemsstar program.the national heart, lung, and blood institute (nhlbi) supports a broad research and training portfolio in the treatment and prevention of heart, lung, blood, and sleep diseases. the institute is tasked with combating not only the major causes of death and disability but also rare disorders such as congenital heart disease, sickle cell disease, thalassemia, and pulmonary fibrosis. the nhlbi’s research programs span the entire research spectrum comprising fundamental discovery science, early translational research, clinical investigations, population science research, and translational research that moves fundamental discoveries into clinical and public health practice in real world settings. visit the nhlbi strategic vision for research priorities that will help accelerate research and scientific advances over the next decade. to achieve the goals related to this foa, nhlbi is interested in applications from clinicians (with md or equivalent degrees) who intend to pursue research in the investigation of heart, lung, blood or sleep diseases for careers as clinician-scientists.the national cancer institute (nci) supports and facilitates basic research in all areas of cancer biology and investigates the biological aspects of every form of cancer, carrying out studies that range from targeted, long-running projects that are revealing the microscopic details of cell processes to high-risk, innovative research that holds promise for providing key insights into tumor development; research in cancer surveillance, epidemiology, health services, behavioral science, and cancer survivorship; research to assess a person's risk of developing cancer and to find ways to reduce that risk; research focus across the continuum between the initiation of the cancer process and the occurrence of the invasive disease, with the goal of detecting changes and intervening early in the cancer process to prevent disease and death; research that facilitates the path to clinical application of promising cancer detection, diagnosis, and treatment methods; it also expedites the initial small-scale and subsequent large-scale testing of new anticancer agents, biomarkers, imaging tests, and other therapeutic interventions in patients; cancer health disparities and community-based participatory research; research in hiv/aids and hiv malignancies.the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases (niaid) conducts and supports basic and applied research to better understand, treat, and ultimately prevent infectious, immunologic, and allergic diseases. for more than 60 years, niaid research has led to new therapies, vaccines, diagnostic tests, and other technologies that have improved the health of millions. specifically, our areas of study are hiv/aids, infectious diseases, and allergy, immunology, and transplantation research. applications for this program would be appropriate for niaid if they propose to gain research experiences in the fields of biomedical research (including translational research) in these niaid mission-relevant areas.note: this funding opportunity announcement (foa) is designed specifically for applicants proposing research that does not involve leading an independent clinical trial, a clinical trial feasibility study, or an ancillary clinical trial. applicants to this foa are permitted to propose research experience in a clinical trial led by a mentor or co-mentor.nih defines a clinical trial as "a research study in which one or more human subjects are prospectively assigned to one or more interventions (which may include placebo or other control) to evaluate the effects of those interventions on health-related biomedical or behavioral outcomes." (not-od-15-015).nih not only supports trials of safety and efficacy, it also supports mechanistic exploratory studies that meet the definition of a clinical trial and are designed to explore or understand a biological or behavioral process, the pathophysiology of a disease, or the mechanism of action of an intervention. these studies may focus on basic and/or translational discovery research in healthy human subjects and in human subjects who are affected by the pathophysiology of diseases and disorders. by addressing basic questions and concepts in biology, behavior, and pathophysiology, these studies may provide insight into understanding human diseases and disorders along with potential treatments or preventive strategies. nih also supports biomarker studies that meet the definition of a clinical trial and that may provide information about physiological function, target engagement of novel therapeutics, and/or the impact of therapeutics on treatment response. nih thus supports studies that meet the definition of clinical trials (as noted above) but do not seek to establish safety, clinical efficacy, effectiveness, clinical management, and/or implementation of preventive, therapeutic, and services interventions.see section viii. other information for award authorities and regulations.grant: a support mechanism providing money, property, or both to an eligible entity to carry out an approved project or activity.only those application types listed here are allowed for this foa.not allowed: only accepting applications that do not propose clinical trials.note: applicants may propose to gain experience in a clinical trial led by a mentor/co-mentor as part of their research career development.the number of awards is contingent upon nih appropriations and the

total costs of up to $260,000 per year in fy 2023 and fy 2024 to support up to two new awards per fiscal year.award budgets are composed of salary and other program-related expenses, as described below.the total project period may not exceed 2 years.nih will contribute up to $60,000 per year toward the salary of the career award recipient. further guidance on budgeting for career development salaries is provided in the sf424 (r&r) application guide (see also not-od-17-094).transition scholar compensation: the total salary requested must be based on a full-time appointment and be consistent with the postgraduate year (pgy) salary structure at the applicant institution. during a research year, transition scholars in clinical fellowships will be paid 75% of their base pgy salary level set by the institution.transition scholar salary should be calculated for the months of full-time research engagement over a year:for example, a scholar engages in research for a year at a pgy salary of $75,000, with a monthly salary of $6,250; the k38 award will support 75% effort over 12 months, which equates to 9.0 person-months; the budgeted salary for this participant would be $56,250 ($6,250 x 9.0 or 75% of $75,000).transition scholars who are early career faculty applicants (as defined in section iii: eligibility information), total salary requested must be based on a full-time appointment. during a research year, transition scholar faculty will be paid 50% of their base salary up to a maximum of $60,000. the award will support 50% effort over 12 months, which equates to 6.0 person-months.further guidance on budgeting for career development salaries is provided in the sf 424 (r&r) application guide. the total salary may not exceed the legislatively mandated salary cap. see: http://grants.nih.gov/grants/policy/salcap_summary.htm.transition scholar research funds: up to $20,000 per research year may be requested for research and career development. research funds may be used to defray costs for registration for short-term courses or workshops to obtain research skills, to support research-related supervisory and mentor skill development for clinician-investigators, or where well-justified, for technical support and/or personnel to contribute to the transition scholar’s research continuity. funds may not be used for tuition for courses leading to a degree, fees required for clinical board certification, or equipment.transition scholar travel: up to $3,000 each year may be requested for each transition scholar to attend or present research findings at domestic scientific conferences, and to support attendance at a nih-sponsored workshop. requests for travel to scientific meetings or workshops must be carefully justified, with

clinical trial not allowed) (rfa-hl-23-006) and started a clinical fellowship or early career faculty position (as instructor or assistant professor for less than 40 months at the time of submission or resubmission) by the time of the k38 award are eligible and encouraged to apply. while the structure of clinical fellowship training may vary among subspecialties, most include at least one year of clinical training and one year of research training. for applicants in clinical fellowship, the starrts k38 program is intended to support the transition scholar during their research training year(s). the pd/pi is invited to work with his/her mentor and organization to develop an application for support. individuals from underrepresented racial and ethnic groups as well as individuals with disabilities are always encouraged to apply for nih support. see, reminder: notice of nih's encouragement of applications supporting individuals from underrepresented ethnic and racial groups as well as individuals with disabilities, not-od-22-019. multiple pds/pis are not allowed.transition scholar k38-supported research and career development may occur at the same or a different institution as that of the nih starr r38 funded institution where the transition scholar's research in residency occurred. in most instances, the k38 application should be submitted by the institution where the transition scholar applicant has been appointed as clinical fellow or early career faculty. for other scenarios, applicants are encouraged to contact the appropriate nih program staff.by the time of award, the individual must be a citizen or a non-citizen national of the united states or have been lawfully admitted for permanent residence (i.e., possess a currently valid permanent resident card uscis form i-551, or other legal verification of such status).clinicians (including those with m.d., d.d.s, d.v.m. and other licensed professionals) in positions not designated as postdoctoral (clinical fellowship) positions: following clinical residency training, some clinicians directly transition to a faculty position that denotes independence in clinical responsibilities but not in research. clinicians in such positions who have participated in the nih r38 starr program are strongly encouraged to obtain confirmation of their eligibility with nih institute or center staff before they begin to prepare their k38 applications. such individuals may also wish to consider other career awards (see k kiosk, for example) available for junior faculty development.2. cost sharing3. additional information on eligibilityapplicant organizations may submit more than one application, provided that each application is scientifically distinct, and each is from a different candidate.the nih will not accept duplicate or highly overlapping applications under review at the same time per 2.3.7.4 submission of resubmission application. an individual may not have two or more competing nih career development applications pending review concurrently. in addition, nih will not accept:this award is intended to support transition scholars research and career development activities during the research training phase of fellowship. during a k38-supported research year, transition scholars in fellowship are expected to commit at least 75% professional effort (e.g., 9 person months per year). recognizing that some r38 starr resident investigators may directly transition to faculty positions, early career faculty (as defined in section iii: eligibility information) are expected to commit at least 50% professional effort. in addition, this k38 award is intended to support transition scholars who can document that sufficient institutional support is available to allow for sufficient protected time to dedicate to k38 mentored research effort. transition scholar awardees may concurrently engage in other duties (such as clinical and teaching activities) as part of the remaining effort not covered by the award, as long as such duties do not interfere with or detract from the proposed research and career development activities.candidates who have va appointments may not consider part of the va effort toward satisfying the full-time requirement at the applicant institution. candidates with va appointments should contact the staff person in the relevant participating institute or center prior to preparing an application to discuss their eligibility.under certain circumstances, an awardee may submit a written request to the awarding component requesting a reduction in minimum required percent effort, which will be considered on a case-by-case basis. details on this policy are provided in not-od-09-036.the overall structure of research and clinical activities outlined in the application should lead to participant eligibility for certification or endorsement and oversight by a board recognized by the american board of medical specialties (abms), or for dentists, specialties approved by the council on dental education and licensure of the american dental association, or for veterinarians, specialties approved by the american veterinary medical association.mentor(s), co-menter, career supportbefore submitting the application, the candidate must identify a primary mentor who will supervise the proposed career development and research activities. this individual should have both research expertise and a successful track record of mentoring clinician-investigators at the candidate's career stage. where possible, clinician-investigator co-mentor(s) or career mentor(s) with different professional and research degree backgrounds should have opportunities to meet with both transition scholars and primary mentor(s) to discuss effective research career strategies.the primary mentor should be an active investigator in the area of the proposed research, and should demonstrate commitment both to the career development of the candidate and to the direct supervision of the candidate’s research. this mentor should document the availability of sufficient research support and facilities for high-quality research. candidates are encouraged to identify more than one mentor, i.e., a mentoring team (and/or an advisory committee), if this is deemed advantageous for providing expert advice in all aspects of the research and career development program. in such cases of multiple mentors, the application must identify the primary mentor who will coordinate the candidate’s research activities, and include a mentoring plan. the candidate is encouraged to work with the mentor(s) in preparing the application.in addition, prior to award, applicants are encouraged to identify a separate career mentor who will serve as a clinician investigator career role model and help broaden the candidate's professional network by providing additional career guidance, advice about research directions and other potential funded research opportunities, and promoting the applicant for national presentations. the career mentor may be affiliated with the k38 candidate's institution or another institution and is expected to be involved with one or more professional societies important for the transition scholar's career as a clinician investigator (e.g. american thoracic society, american heart association, society of black surgeons, american hematological society, association for women radiologists, american society for clinical investigation).the applicant institution must have a strong, well-established record of research and career development activities and faculty qualified to serve as mentors for clinician investigators.1. requesting an application packagebuttons to access the
