national institutes of health (nih)national institute of neurological disorders and stroke (ninds)r61/r33 exploratory/developmental phased awardsee notices of special interest associated with this funding opportunitysee section iii. 3. additional information on eligibility.this funding opportunity announcement (foa) encourages the development and validation of animal models and human/animal tissue ex vivo systems that recapitulate the phenotypic and physiologic characteristics of a defined neurological or neuromuscular disorder. the goal of this foa is to promote a significant improvement in the translational relevance of animal models or ex vivo systems that will be utilized to facilitate future development of neurotherapeutics. ideally, models proposed for this foa would have the potential to provide feasible and meaningful assessments of efficacy following therapeutic intervention that would be applicable in both preclinical and clinical settings. this foa is part of a suite of innovation grants to nurture initial translational efforts (ignite) program focused on enabling the exploratory and early stages of drug discovery.not applicableall applications are due by 5:00 pm local time of applicant organization. all types of non-aids applications allowed for this funding opportunity announcement are due on the listed date(s).applicants are encouraged to apply early to allow adequate time to make any corrections to errors found in the application during the submission process by the due date.not applicableit is critical that applicants follow the instructions in the research (r) instructions in the sf424 (r&r) application guide, except where instructed to do otherwise (in this foa or in a notice from nih guide for grants and contracts).conformance to all requirements (both in the application guide and the foa) is required and strictly enforced. applicants must read and follow all application instructions in the application guide as well as any program-specific instructions noted in section iv. when the program-specific instructions deviate from those in the application guide, follow the program-specific instructions.applications that do not comply with these instructions may be delayed or not accepted for review.there are several options available to submit your application through grants.gov to nih and department of health and human services partners. you must use one of these submission options to access the application forms for this opportunity.background optimization of novel therapeutics is usually dependent upon preclinical evaluation in animal models or ex vivo model systems (referred to as simply ‘models’ for this foa). this foa is intended to support the development of validated and clinically relevant animal models, and/or ex vivo model systems. these models should translate to the clinical setting to the degree that they can inform the decision to advance a therapeutic candidate to clinical testing and can inform clinical study design.animal models and ex vivo model systems should represent a significant advance over those that currently exist for a defined neurological or neuromuscular disease/disorder. they can include genetic, chemical, and/or physiological manipulations in animals or ex vivo systems that recapitulate a significant component (clinical manifestations and underlying physiology) of the disease condition in humans. animal models should be compatible with endpoints that are measurable and relevant to the disease process in both preclinical and clinical settings.development of models that translate to a human disorder or disease requires rigorous internal and external validation. in order to demonstrate internal validation, it is important to evaluate and understand the precision, reliability, sensitivity, accuracy, and dynamic range characteristics of the endpoints used to assess the effect of therapeutic or physiological intervention in the animal model or model system. in addition, it is essential that the general experimental design procedures utilized in characterizing the model are conducted in a rigorous manner, utilizing randomization, blinding and the appropriate power analysis. it is also important to address external validation, showing that the model can recapitulate aspects of the disease phenotype and etiology, where endpoints or biomarkers of disease are similar and measurable in both the model system and in human disease. one component of external validity is face validity-the similarity between the model and the clinical manifestation of the disease (as measured by overt clinical symptoms, patterns of activation using fmri or eeg, functional or behavioral read-outs, disease progression, etc.). another component of external validity is construct validity--the similarity between the physiological or biological basis of the model and the actual human disorder (i.e., genetic, proteomic, metabolomic markers).although components of both face and construct external validity are certainly desirable in a model, predictive validity provides the most confidence in the ability of the model to translate to human disease. predictive validity refers to the probability that a clinically validated therapeutic (biologic, small molecule, device, surgical procedure, etc.) will have the same effects in the model as it will in the intended clinical population. by definition, the evaluation of predictive validity requires a validated tool/therapeutic that has been shown to alter disease progression in humans. note that experimental therapeutics cannot be used to validate an experimental model. predictive validation of the model requires a validated tool/therapeutic with a known effect in humans. since these tools do not necessarily exist for many neurological diseases, it is not always possible to obtain true evidence of predictive validity until the candidate therapeutic is actually tested in humans. therefore, it may not always be possible to evaluate the predictive validity of a new animal model or ex vivo model system. however, it is important to include evaluations of internal validity, and face, construct, and predictive validity (to the extent possible), to provide evidence that the proposed model represents a significant advance over existing models.foa scope the foa will support applications to develop animal models of neurological or neuromuscular disease that recapitulate aspects of the disease pathophysiology as well as its etiology, where endpoints or markers of disease are similar and measurable in the animal model and human disease (i.e., neurological deficits, patterns of activation using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fmri) or electroencephalography (eeg), measurable genetic markers, functional or behavioral read-out, disease progression, etc.). the foa will also support the development of non-genetic models (i.e., motor function, physiological manipulations such as artificial vessel obstruction or diet) that expose disease symptoms in animals and humans. in addition, it will support the development and validation of ex vivo testing systems that utilize existing human or animal cell systems (i.e., induced pluripotent stem cells (ipsc)).applications for use or development of ipscs should consult not-ns-14-032.since this foa does not support the development of animal models or model systems for the purpose of testing hypotheses about disease etiology, it is assumed that model development will be based upon widely accepted hypotheses or knowledge regarding disease etiology.the knowledge gained from these studies should lead to the development of "next generation" translational models of neurological disease. the models developed and validated as a result of applications to this foa should provide an improved “translational toolkit” that will better predict the efficacy and safety of new therapeutic entities, thereby facilitating future drug discovery and development in the field of neurological disorders and stroke.applications that propose to validate existing models are also appropriate for this foa. however, development of de novo models without validation is not appropriate for this foa.phased award mechanism and transition to r33 the identification and characterization of clinically relevant preclinical models typically require a multi-step process that includes initial feasibility testing of the model system followed by internal and external validation. therefore, this funding opportunity will use a phased r61/r33 mechanism. the r61 phase will support initial development, internal validation and optimization of the model. the r33 phase will support any required scaling along with external validation studies. the final outcome should be a fully validated model that can be utilized in both preclinical and clinical settings to test the biological effects of candidate therapeutics designed to treat neurological disease. transition from the r61 to the r33 phase is contingent upon the successful completion of proposed milestones. milestones are goals that are quantifiable for measuring success that can be used for go/no-go decision making at the r61/r33 transition point and should have timelines and quantitative criteria associated with them. all milestones should be useful as a measure of progress toward the overall goal of the project (see section iv). ninds emphasizes the importance of the robustness and reproducibility of experimental results in evaluating progress. specific aims or a list of activities planned for each year are not considered milestones because they do not provide decision-making goals. for frequently asked questions and milestone examples, please see https://www.ninds.nih.gov/current-research/research-funded-ninds/translational-research/funding-programs-researchers/ignite.examples of activities in the r61 phase include, but are not limited to:examples of activities in the r33 phase include, but are not limited to:collaborations:demonstration of collaborative relationships between applicants with preclinical and clinical drug development expertise (such as biostatisticians and clinicians) is highly encouraged. it is preferred that the collaborating clinician is listed as a co-investigator or a formal member of the investigative team. alternatively, a letter of support from the collaborating clinician can be used to demonstrate involvement in the project but should include a plan for collaboration with the principal investigator. the clinician should have demonstrated experience in the development of therapeutic entities to treat neurological disease.in addition, applicants should strive to increase the diversity of their teams. research shows that diverse teams working together and capitalizing on innovative ideas and distinct perspectives outperform homogenous teams. scientists from diverse backgrounds and life experiences bring different perspectives, creativity, and individual enterprise to address complex scientific problems. there are many benefits that flow from a diverse nih-supported scientific workforce, including: fostering scientific innovation, enhancing global competitiveness, contributing to robust learning environments, improving the quality of the research, advancing the likelihood that underserved or health disparity populations participate in, and benefit from health research, and enhancing public trust. please see nih not-od-20-031 for details.applications not responsive to this foa:non-responsive studies include those that involve any of the following activities:studies that fail to include quantitative, go/no-go milestones as well as a clear demarcation of which activities are in the r61 phase and which are in the r33 phase are also considered non-responsive. non-responsive applications will be administratively withdrawn without review.additional

within the specific aims section, include headers titled r61 phase specific aims and r33 phase specific aims. under each header, state the specific objectives of the efforts. briefly provide the context and overall rationale for the proposed set of studies, with an emphasis on the reason that the proposed model will significantly improve the translational quality of existing tools in the specified neurological disease area. in addition, the major objectives of the proposed set of studies should be stated, including the technical questions to be answered to determine the feasibility and the validity of the proposed model systems relative to the end goal of a clinical setting.as this is an r61/r33 mechanism, clear demarcation of which activities are in the r61 and which are in the r33 is required (the two phases should not overlap in time). applications that do not propose both an r61 and r33 phase will be administratively withdrawn without review. research strategy: the research strategy section should include the following sections:milestonestransition from the r61 to the r33 phase is contingent upon the successful completion of one set of proposed milestones. the specific milestone(s) proposed in the application will depend on the goals of the application and the accomplishments necessary in the r61 phase for advancement into the scaling and validation studies proposed for the r33 phase. these milestones are to be included as the last element of the research strategy section of the application and will be evaluated as part of the scientific and technical merit of the r61/r33 application. the milestones proposed in the application should be well-described, quantifiable, and scientifically justified to allow program staff to assess progress in the r61 phase. in addition, milestones should reflect the objectives of the application and be appropriate for the indication. rationale should be provided for the choice of measures and values proposed for the milestones. specific aims or a list of activities is not considered milestones because they would not provide decision-making goals. a discussion of the milestones relative to the progress of the
