information on eligibility.the fogarty hiv research training (hivrt) program supports research training that strengthens hiv research capacity of institutions in low-and middle-income countries (lmics). this foa offers an opportunity for lmic institutions to submit a planning grant application to prepare to participate in the fogarty hiv research training program.this funding opportunity announcement (foa) does not allow appointed trainees to lead an independent clinical trial, but does allow them to obtain research experience in a clinical trial led by a mentor or co-mentor.letter of intent may be submitted 30 days prior to the application due date, but is not required.all applications are due by 5:00 pm local time of applicant organization.applicants are encouraged to apply early to allow adequate time to make any corrections to errors found in the application during the submission process by the due date.not applicableit is critical that applicants follow the training (t) instructions in the sf424 (r&r) application guide, except where instructed to do otherwise (in this foa or in a notice from the nih guide for grants and contracts). conformance to all requirements (both in the application guide and the foa) is required and strictly enforced. applicants must read and follow all application instructions in the application guide as well as any program-specific instructions noted insection iv. when the program-specific instructions deviate from those in the application guide, follow the program-specific instructions. applications that do not comply with these instructions may be delayed or not accepted for review.there are several options available to submit your application through grants.gov to nih and department of health and human services partners. you must use one of these submission options to access the application forms for this opportunity.clinical trials are not allowed.purpose and background informationthe fogarty hiv research training (hivrt) program supports research training that strengthens hiv research capacity of institutions in low-and middle-income countries (lmics). this foa offers an opportunity for lmic institutions to submit a planning grant application to participate in the fogarty hiv research training program.these planning grant applications must propose a plan to develop a research training program and the subsequent application that will be submitted in response to the companion d43 foa (par-22-151). the planned research training program should strengthen research capacity in a defined high priority hiv scientific area aligned with nih research priorities (not-od-20-018) at a specific lmic institution.program objectivethe overall goal of the fogarty hiv research training (hivrt) program is to strengthen the scientific capacity of institutions in lmics to conduct hiv research related to the evolving hiv epidemic in their country.the hivrt program currently invites applications for three different funding opportunity announcements (foas). this d71 foa for a planning grant to develop a subsequent training grant application to the companion d43 foa (par-22-151). the third foa (g11) encourages applications for infrastructure development training in several research support functions described in par-22-153. through these foas the hivrt program is expected to strengthen scientific research environment needed for hiv research at lmic institutions.this foa provides support for lmic institutions with strong hiv research experience, expertise and resources to plan a research training program that will maximize prior investments in research and research training, further strengthen the lmic institution's research and research training capabilities and provide more accessible research training opportunities to others in their own country and in other lmics. a planning grant provides support for lmic institutions to consult their partners, assess strengths and gaps in research and research training capacity with the goal to submit a competitive application for funding in response to the d43 foa.lmic institutions have the option to apply for a planning grant (in response to this foa) or may apply for a research training award (in response to the d43 foa). this foa for a d71 application is not a pre-requisite for a submitting a d43 application, but is designed to allow the pds/pis to conduct a needs assessment at their institutions for research training in a defined scientific area and assemble the core team for the development of the d43 training program. the core team is expected to demonstrate evidence of collaboration during the d71 period, at the time of d43 submission.backgroundthe fic, with co-funding from other nih institutes, centers and offices (icos), has provided over 30 years of support to enhance hiv research through hiv research training programs. scientists supported through these awards have participated in important hiv research conducted at lmic institutions in partnership with u.s. and other international scientists and scientific institutions. over the years, some of the most important scientific advances in hiv/aids, including interventions to reduce mother-to-child hiv transmission, address hiv/tb co-infection, prevent hiv infection through behavior change, and develop microbicides and antiretroviral drugs, were facilitated through partnerships with lmic scientists and supported by the fic research training programs. continued investment in training to strengthen research at lmic institutions is needed to address the on-going hiv epidemic and to achieve the goals of a "cure" and an "aids-free generation."efforts to implement research findings in the context of increased hiv prevention, care and treatment services in lmics over the past years led to the emergence of new issues, such as how to best combine hiv prevention interventions, link newly diagnosed individuals into care programs, and integrate hiv programs with other health services. as lmics implement hiv prevention, care and treatment programs, these and other, yet undefined, issues will need evidence-based solutions.the social context of an lmic influences the design of research to answer many of these evolving hiv research questions, therefore lmic institutions and researchers are best positioned to conduct the most relevant hiv research, disseminate the results in-country, and influence policymakers, program managers and medical/public health practice. in the hivrt d43 program, each research training award is expected to focus on strengthening specific high priority hiv research capacity at an identified lmic institution(s).the hivrt program is designed to move beyond simple output indicators (number and type of people trained, research products) to outcome indicators (including increased research capacity at an lmic institution). during the planning phase, applicants should design a monitoring and evaluation plan to meet those goals.program considerationsthe program provides opportunities for u.s and lmic institutions to collaborate with each other and their partners to fill gaps in training in a particular area that will strengthen hiv research capacity at the proposed lmic institutions. applicants should design hiv research training programs such that trainees can address both long-standing and emerging hiv research questions, responsive to the needs of their institutions and countries. the program is also expected to enhance the capacity for lmic institutions to collaborate with nih, u.s. government, other donors and lmics in their hiv/aids efforts.the objectives of the planning grant are to:applicants are encouraged to review the nih hiv/aids research priorities (https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/not-od-20-018.html), the nih plan for hiv-related research for the year they are applying (https://www.oar.nih.gov/sites/default/files/nih_strategicplan_fy2021-2025.pdf), and the fic strategic plan (https://www.fic.nih.gov/about/pages/strategic-plan.aspx) to inform the planning process proposed.within the context of the requirements for the planning grant as described above, nidcr will support planning grants for institutions proposing hiv research training as it relates to dental, oral and craniofacial health. participation of schools of dentistry is encouraged. for more information on nidcr hiv/aids research priorities, see:
