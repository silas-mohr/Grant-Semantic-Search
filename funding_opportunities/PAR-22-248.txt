award - research & trainingnot-od-23-012 - reminder: forms-h grant application forms & instructions must be used for due dates on or after january 25, 2023 - new grant application instructions now availablesee section iii. 3. additional information on eligibility.the purpose of this nih mentored research scientist development award (k01) is to provide salary and research support to investigators who are within ten years of completing their terminal professional degree or residency training. research and mentorship must be in the field of hiv/aids translational studies, using nonhuman primates (nhps) as preclinical models. these awards will provide 3 years of support for intensive research career development under the guidance of an experienced mentorship team, with expertise in both the pre-clinical application of nhp hiv/aids models and in translation of the results from such studies to clinical application in humans. the expectation is that this sustained experience will launch independent research careers and enable awardees to become competitive for new research project grant (e.g., r01) funding. this funding initiative addresses research priorities of the fiscal year (fy) 2021-2025 nih strategic plan for hiv and hiv-related research (https://www.oar.nih.gov/hiv-policy-and-research/strategic-plan): reduce the incidence of hiv; develop next-generation hiv therapies; research toward hiv cure; and address hiv-associated comorbidities, coinfections, and complications.this funding opportunity announcement (foa) is designed specifically for applicants proposing research that does not involve leading an independent clinical trial, a clinical trial feasibility study, or an ancillary clinical trial.applicants to this foa are permitted to propose research experience in a clinical trial led by a mentor or co-mentor.not applicableall applications are due by 5:00 pm local time of applicant organization.applications are encouraged to apply early to allow adequate time to make any corrections to errors found in the application during the submission process by the due date.not applicableit is critical that applicants follow the instructions in the career development (k) instructions in the sf424 (r&r) application guide, except where instructed to do otherwise (in this foa or in a notice from the nih guide for grants and contracts). conformance to all requirements (both in the application guide and the foa) is required and strictly enforced. applicants must read and follow all application instructions in the application guide as well as any program-specific instructions noted in section iv. when the program-specific instructions deviate from those in the application guide, follow the program-specific instructions. applications that do not comply with these instructions may be delayed or not accepted for review.there are several options available to submit your application through grants.gov to nih and department of health and human services partners. you must use one of these submission options to access the application forms for this opportunity.the overall goal of the nih research career development program is to help ensure that a diverse pool of highly trained scientists is available in appropriate scientific disciplines to address the nation's biomedical, behavioral, and clinical research needs. nih institutes and centers (ics) support a variety of mentored and non-mentored career development award programs designed to foster the transition of new investigators to research independence and to support established investigators in achieving specific objectives. candidates should review the different career development (k) award programs to determine the best program to support their goals. more information about career programs may be found at the nih extramural training mechanisms website.the objective of the nih mentored research scientist development award (k01) is to provide salary and research support for a sustained period of “protected time” (3-5 years) for intensive research career development, under the guidance of an experienced mentor, or sponsor in the biomedical, behavioral or clinical sciences leading to research independence. the expectation is that, through this sustained period of research career development and training, recipients will launch independent research careers and become competitive for new research project grant (e.g., r01) funding.the purpose of this nih mentored research scientist development award (k01) is to provide salary and research support to investigators who are within ten years of completing their terminal professional degree or residency training and who have at least two years of postdoctoral training or equivalent. for this foa, research and mentorship must be focused on hiv/aids studies using nonhuman primates (nhps) as preclinical models. these awards will provide three years of support for intensive research career development under the guidance of an experienced mentorship team, with expertise both in the use of nhps as preclinical models and in the translation of results from nhp models to humans. the expectation is that through this sustained period of research career development, awardees will launch independent research careers and become competitive for new research project grant (e.g., r01) funding.preclinical studies using nhps are essential for development of effective hiv/aids treatment and prevention. further, the fy 2021-2025 nih strategic plan for hiv and hiv-related research (https://www.oar.nih.gov/hiv-policy-and-research/strategic-plan) identifies several high-priority areas for hiv/aids treatment and prevention for which nhp models are highly relevant. these topics include, but are not limited to:furthermore, the nih strategic plan for hiv and hiv-related research identifies training, infrastructure, and capacity building as important to enhancing hiv/aids research. a critical factor that will facilitate development of effective hiv/aids treatment and prevention is to increase the workforce that can employ nhps as preclinical models and translate those findings to human clinical investigations and trials. various facilities, such as the national primate research centers and other nhp centers, in collaboration with many scientists around the world, are training new investigators to successfully employ nhp models in hiv/aids studies. the high cost and time required to perform nhp studies make it challenging for junior investigators to transition to independent positions. furthermore, these investigators often receive little training in how to translate results from nhp models to humans. the mentored research scientist development awards under this announcement will provide the support and training these early stage investigators (esis) require to begin translating their nhp studies into human applications. the investigators will receive mentorship to enhance critical aspects of career development such as grantsmanship, networking and ability to translate results from animals to the clinic.research objectivesin addition to orip’s interests, described above, other participating institutes are interested in fostering career development in the research areas indicated below.the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases (niaid) is interested in research applications focused on:the national institute of mental health (nimh) is interested in research applications focused on understanding mechanisms involved in human immunodeficiency virus (hiv)-1 associated cns disease (mental health and neurocognitive co-morbidities) in the context of viral suppression and in applications studying mechanisms of hiv-1 persistence/latency focused on the cns. further, studies to aid in the identification of biomarkers of cns disease associated with hiv and development of viral eradication strategies from cns reservoirs are of interest.nonresponsive: studies focused on peripheral viral reservoirs and pathogenesis research not in the context of antiretroviral therapy will not be supported.note: this funding opportunity announcement (foa) is designed specifically for applicants proposing research that does not involve leading an independent clinical trial, a clinical trial feasibility study, or an ancillary clinical trial. applicants to this foa are permitted to propose research experience in a clinical trial led by a mentor or co-mentor. applicants proposing a clinical trial or an ancillary study to an ongoing clinical trial as lead investigator, should apply to the companion foa (pa-18-nnn). applicants to this foa are permitted to propose research experience in a clinical trial led by a mentor or co-mentor.nih defines a clinical trial as "a research study in which one or more human subjects are prospectively assigned to one or more interventions (which may include placebo or other control) to evaluate the effects of those interventions on health-related biomedical or behavioral outcomes." (not-od-15-015).nih not only supports trials of safety and efficacy, it also supports mechanistic exploratory studies that meet the definition of a clinical trial and are designed to explore or understand a biological or behavioral process, the pathophysiology of a disease, or the mechanism of action of an intervention. these studies may focus on basic and/or translational discovery research in healthy human subjects and in human subjects who are affected by the pathophysiology of diseases and disorders. by addressing basic questions and concepts in biology, behavior, and pathophysiology, these studies may provide insight into understanding human diseases and disorders along with potential treatments or preventive strategies. nih also supports biomarker studies that meet the definition of a clinical trial and that may provide information about physiological function, target engagement of novel therapeutics, and/or the impact of therapeutics on treatment response. nih thus supports studies that meet the definition of clinical trials (as noted above) but do not seek to establish safety, clinical efficacy, effectiveness, clinical management, and/or implementation of preventive, therapeutic, and services interventions.note: this funding opportunity announcement (foa) is designed specifically for applicants proposing research that does not involve leading an independent clinical trial, a clinical trial feasibility study, or an ancillary clinical trial. applicants to this foa are permitted to propose research experience in a clinical trial led by a mentor or co-mentor. .see section viii. other information for award authorities and regulations.grant: a support mechanism providing money, property, or both to an eligible entity to carry out an approved project or activity.not allowed: only accepting applications that do not propose clinical trials.note: applicants may propose to gain experience in a clinical trial led by a mentor/co-mentor as part of their research career development.the number of awards is contingent upon nih appropriations and the submission of a sufficient number of meritorious applications.the total project period may not
