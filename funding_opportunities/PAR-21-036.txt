the research (r) instructions in the sf424 (r&r) application guide,except where instructed to do otherwise (in this foa or in a notice from nih guide for grants and contracts ).conformance to all requirements (both in the application guide and the foa) is required and strictly enforced. applicants must read and follow all application instructions in the application guide as well as any program-specific instructions noted in section iv. when the program-specific instructions deviate from those in the application guide, follow the program-specific instructions.applications that do not

critical questions about a particular disease or disease process. it is essential to support clinical studies to test promising new interventions with the potential to improve health practices and clinical care. the niams is committed to identifying effective approaches to address arthritis and musculoskeletal and skin diseases and disorders. improving health through the generation of high quality data from well-designed and executed clinical trials is a high priority for the niams.a clinical trial is defined by nih as "a research study in which one or more human subjects are prospectively assigned to one or more interventions (which may include placebo or other control) to evaluate the effects of those interventions on health-related biomedical or behavioral outcomes."the niams has designed its clinical trials program to support a broad spectrum of research and trial designs by offering funding opportunities that are tailored to different stages of study development:it is worth noting that larger, more complex trials require substantial planning and preparation prior to beginning enrollment of human subjects, and investigators are expected to be ready to begin the trial without further planning activities when the u01 is awarded. niams strongly encourages prospective applicants to pay special attention to advance preparation and planning in order to avoid delaying: (1) the conduct of these important studies, and (2) analysis of data and dissemination of results.please see the niams clinical research webpage for a listing of investigator-initiated clinical research opportunities.in order to accomplish necessary planning with niams support, investigators may apply for a niams clinical trial planning grant (r34) prior to submitting an application for the u01 to implement the trial. the planning grant will allow an investigator to accomplish the planning activities (e.g., development of a study protocol, manual of operating procedures, consent/assent forms, fda regulatory submissions, etc.) that are often necessary prior to implementing a clinical trial. investigators who have already completed planning activities either by a previously awarded niams r34, or other means may also submit a u01 implementation application, but are strongly encouraged to consult with niams staff in advance. investigators considering applying to the niams for a clinical trial award should refer to the information found on the niams clinical trial policies, guidelines, and templates webpage.submitting an application for clinical trial implementationonce appropriate planning milestones have been completed, either through an r34 or some other means, investigators may apply for the u01 clinical trial implementation cooperative agreement.applications that propose multi-site studies with multiple domestic sites are subject to the nih single irb policy as indicated in https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/not-od-20-058.htmlas well as the single irb requirement under the cooperative research provision (45 cfr 46.114)

review, all applications will receive a written critique.applications may undergo a selection process in which only those applications deemed to have the highest scientific and technical merit (generally the top half of applications under review) will be discussed and assigned an overall impact score.applications will be assigned on the basis of established phs referral guidelines to the appropriate nih institute or center. applications will compete for available funds with all other recommended applications. following initial peer review, recommended applications will receive a second level of review by the national arthritis and musculoskeletal and skin diseases advisory council (namsac). the following will be considered in making funding decisions:information regarding the disposition of applications is available in the nih grants policy statement.a formal notification in the form of a notice of award (noa) will be provided to the applicant organization for successful applications. the noa signed by the grants management officer is the authorizing document and will be sent via email to the grantee’s business official.awardees must comply with any funding restrictions described in section iv.5. funding restrictions. selection of an application for award is not an authorization to begin performance. any costs incurred before receipt of the noa are at the recipient's risk. these costs may be reimbursed only to the extent considered allowable pre-award costs.any application awarded in response to this foa will be subject to terms and conditions found on the award conditions and information for nih grants website. this includes any recent legislation and policy applicable to awards that is highlighted on this website.individual awards are based on the application submitted to, and as approved by, the nih and are subject to the ic-specific terms and conditions identified in the noa.clinicaltrials.gov: if an award provides for one or more clinical trials. by law (title viii, section 801 of public law 110-85), the "responsible party" must register and submit results information for certain "applicable clinical trials" on the clinicaltrials.gov protocol registration and results system information website (https://register.clinicaltrials.gov). nih expects registration of all trials whether required under the law or not. for more information, see https://grants.nih.gov/policy/clinical-trials/reporting/index.htm.institutional review board or independent ethics committee approval: grantee institutions must ensure that all protocols are reviewed by their irb or iec. to help ensure the safety of participants enrolled in nih-funded studies, the awardee must provide nih copies of documents related to all major changes in the status of ongoing protocols.data and safety monitoring requirements: the nih policy for data and safety monitoring requires oversight and monitoring of all nih-conducted or -supported human biomedical and behavioral intervention studies (clinical trials) to ensure the safety of participants and the validity and integrity of the data. further information concerning these requirements is found at https://grants.nih.gov/policy/humansubjects.htm and in the application instructions (sf424 (r&r) and phs 398).investigational new drug or investigational device exemption requirements: consistent with federal regulations, clinical research projects involving the use of investigational therapeutics, vaccines, or other medical interventions (including licensed products and devices for a purpose other than that for which they were licensed) in humans under a research protocol must be performed under a food and drug administration (fda) investigational new drug (ind) or investigational device exemption (ide).all nih grant and cooperative agreement awards include the nih grants policy statement as part of the noa. for these terms of award, see the nih grants policy statement part ii: terms and conditions of nih grant awards, subpart a: general and part ii: terms and conditions of nih grant awards, subpart b: terms and conditions for specific types of grants,

compliance with federal civil rights laws that prohibit discrimination on the basis of race, color, national origin, disability, age and, in some circumstances, religion, conscience, and sex. this includes ensuring programs are accessible to persons with limited english proficiency. the hhs office for civil rights provides guidance on complying with civil rights laws enforced by hhs. please see https://www.hhs.gov/civil-rights/for-providers/provider-obligations/index.html and http://www.hhs.gov/ocr/civilrights/understanding/section1557/index.html.hhs recognizes that research projects are often limited in scope for many reasons that are nondiscriminatory, such as the principal investigator’s scientific interest, funding limitations, recruitment requirements, and other considerations. thus, criteria in research protocols that target or exclude certain populations are warranted where nondiscriminatory justifications establish that such criteria are appropriate with respect to the health or safety of the subjects, the scientific study design, or the purpose of the research. for additional guidance regarding how the provisions apply to nih grant programs, please contact the scientific/research contact that is identified in section vii under agency contacts of this foa.please contact the hhs office for civil rights for more information about obligations and prohibitions

872 of the duncan hunter national defense authorization act of fiscal year 2009 (public law 110-417), nih awards will be subject to the federal awardee performance and integrity information system (fapiis) requirements. fapiis requires federal award making officials to review and consider information about an applicant in the designated integrity and performance system (currently fapiis) prior to making an award. an applicant, at its option, may review information in the designated integrity and performance systems accessible through fapiis and comment on any information about itself that a federal agency previously entered and is currently in fapiis. the federal awarding agency will consider any comments by the applicant, in addition to other information in fapiis, in making a judgement about the applicant’s integrity, business ethics, and record of performance under federal awards when completing the review of risk posed by applicants as described in 45 cfr part 75.205 “federal awarding agency review of risk posed by applicants.” this provision will apply to all nih grants and cooperative agreements except fellowships.the following special terms of award are in addition to, and not in lieu of, otherwise applicable u.s. office of management and budget (omb) administrative guidelines, u.s. department of health and human services (dhhs) grant administration regulations at 45 cfr part 75, and other hhs, phs, and nih grant administration policies.the administrative and funding instrument used for this program will be the cooperative agreement, an "assistance" mechanism (rather than an "acquisition" mechanism), in which substantial nih programmatic involvement with the awardees is anticipated during the performance of the activities. under the cooperative agreement, the nih purpose is to support and stimulate the recipients' activities by involvement in and otherwise working jointly with the award recipients in a partnership role; it is not to assume direction, prime responsibility, or a dominant role in the activities. consistent with this concept, the dominant role and prime responsibility resides with the awardees for the project as a whole, although specific tasks and activities may be shared among the awardees and the nih as defined below.at the time of award, depending on the level of programmatic involvement necessary, the cooperative agreement may be converted to an r01.the pd(s)/pi(s) will have the primary responsibility for:all aspects of the study, including any modification of study design, conduct of the study, quality control, data analysis and interpretation, preparation of publications, dissemination of data, tools, and technologies, and collaboration with other investigators, including setting up and convening any external advisory or steering committees.the awardee agrees to accept close coordination, cooperation, and participation of niams staff in those aspects of scientific and technical management of the study as stated in these terms and conditions:the project scientist (ps) has substantial scientific involvement in project activities and generally is not involved in normal programmatic stewardship of the award. a ps has a collaborative relationship with the investigators and participates/collaborates on the work being done. such activities may include:the niams project scientist will have access to data generated under this cooperative agreement and may periodically review the data and progress reports. the project scientist may use information obtained from the data for the preparation of internal reports on the activities of the study. however, awardees will retain custody of and have primary rights to all data developed under these awards, subject to government rights of access consistent with hhs, phs, and nih policies. in addition, the niams project scientist may:program officer/ program director will be responsible for the normal scientific and programmatic stewardship of the award and will be named in the award notice.additional considerations:the niams may terminate or curtail the study in the event of (a)failure to obtain regulatory approval, or implement the study protocol (b) a substantial shortfall in participant recruitment, follow-up, data reporting and dissemination, quality control, or other major breach of the protocol, (c) substantive changes in the agreed-upon protocol with which the niams does not concur, (d) human subject safety and ethical issues that may dictate a premature termination.in addition niams may end the study early if the study reaches a major study objective substantially ahead of schedule with persuasive statistical evidence. areas of joint responsibility include:data and safety monitoring oversight: an independent data and safety monitoring board (dsmb) or safety officer (so) will be appointed by the niams to serve as an advisory body to the institute. the dsmb/so will review study progress, safety data, and interim/final results as outlined in the data and safety monitoring plan (dsmp) and the monitoring body charter and report their finding and recommendations to the niams program official. the niams program official will report in writing to the pd/pis on the deliberations of the dsmb/so reviews and the niams concurrence/non-concurrence of the dsmb/so recommendations. the pd/pis will comply with the dsmb/so recommendations and assume responsibility for reporting the outcome of the monitoring body's reviews and niams recommendations to their respective institutional review boards (irbs).dispute resolution:any disagreements that may arise in scientific or programmatic matters (within the scope of the award) between award recipients and the nih may be brought to dispute resolution. a dispute resolution panel composed of three members will be convened. it will have three members: a designee of the pd/pis, chosen without nih staff voting, one nih designee, and a third designee with expertise in the relevant area who is chosen by the other two; in the case of individual disagreement, the first member may be chosen by the individual awardee. this special dispute resolution procedure does not alter the awardee's right to appeal an adverse action that is otherwise appealable in accordance with phs regulation 42 cfr part 50, subpart d and dhhs regulation 45 cfr part 16.data management and sharingnote: the nih policy for data management and sharing is effective for due dates on or after january 25, 2023.consistent with the nih policy for data management and sharing, when data management and sharing is applicable to the award, recipients will be required to adhere to the data management and sharing requirements as outlined in the nih grants policy statement. upon the approval of a data management and sharing plan, it is required for recipients to implement the plan as described.a final rppr, invention statement, and the expenditure data portion of the federal financial report are required for closeout of an award, as described in the nih grants policy statement.the federal funding accountability and transparency act of 2006 (transparency act), includes a requirement for awardees of federal grants to report information about first-tier subawards and executive compensation under federal assistance awards issued in fy2011 or later. all awardees of applicable nih grants and cooperative agreements are required to report to the federal subaward reporting system (fsrs) available at www.fsrs.gov on all subawards over $25,000. see the nih grants policy statement for additional information on this reporting requirement.in accordance with the regulatory requirements provided at 45 cfr 75.113 and appendix xii to 45 cfr part 75, recipients that have currently active federal grants, cooperative agreements, and procurement contracts from all federal awarding agencies with a cumulative total value greater than $10,000,000 for any period of time during the period of performance of a federal award, must report and maintain the currency of information reported in the system for award management (sam) about civil, criminal, and administrative proceedings in connection with the award or performance of a federal award that reached final disposition within the most recent five-year period. the recipient must also make semiannual disclosures regarding such proceedings. proceedings information will be made publicly available in the designated integrity and performance system (currently fapiis). this is a statutory requirement under section 872 of public law 110-417, as amended (41 u.s.c. 2313). as required by section 3010 of public law 111-212, all information posted in the designated integrity and performance system on or after april 15, 2011, except past performance reviews required for federal procurement contracts, will be publicly available. full reporting requirements and procedures are found in appendix xii to 45 cfr part 75 – award term and conditions for recipient integrity and performance matters.we encourage inquiries concerning this funding opportunity and welcome the
