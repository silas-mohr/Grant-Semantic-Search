nevertheless, even the most robust interventions work only in a subset of those intervened upon and changes can be difficult to sustain over time. there is a need for research in intervention development that bridges basic and applied (interventional) behavioral sciences, in which insights from basic research about the mechanisms and moderators of human behavior are used to develop more effective, efficient, and enduring interventions for health-related behavior change.research objectivesthis notice encourages behavioral intervention research that integrates basic behavioral and social science, that create, refine, and test innovative interventions focused on the initiation, cessation, or maintenance of behaviors associated with improved health or disease mitigation.the behavioral, emotional, cognitive, and/or social targets for interventions being developed and tested in response to this nosi, should be based on insights from basic science about mechanisms that underlie health-related behavior change. interventions may target the individual (e.g., cognitive or psychological processes), the immediate social environment (e.g., dyadic or family relationships), and/or broader social, organizational or environmental systems (e.g., worksites, schools, healthcare delivery, or neighborhood features).outcomes may include clinical indicators or health-related behaviors measured at the individual level or shifts in behavior or health indicators that are measured at an aggregate/population level.applicants are encouraged to employ innovative study designs for building, adapting, and optimizing behavioral interventions. interdisciplinary project teams are also encouraged.the use of an intervention development framework to inform the research plan is encouraged. examples include, and are not limited to, the nih stage model for behavioral intervention development (https://www.nia.nih.gov/research/dbsr/stage-model-behavioral-intervention-development), and the obesity related behavioral intervention trials (orbit) model for behavioral treatment development (https://cancercontrol.cancer.gov/brp/hbrb/translational-research.html). the experimental medicine approach, successfully demonstrated through the nih common fund science of behavior change initiative (https://commonfund.nih.gov/behaviorchange) is a research design that is compatible with both of these intervention development frameworks, as it is intended to help to determine the mechanisms through which an intervention exerts its effects.intervention creation and refinement require iterative and systematic testing of intervention features and components. study timelines should include clear research steps, goals and milestones (go/no-go decision points). it is understood that during the intervention development process, timeline deviations may occur based on study results; for example, findings at one step may require a return to an earlier step to further refine an intervention or better understand the mechanism of action. as such, applicants should include a plan for dealing with unexpected results before proceeding to the next step of the intervention development refinement and testing plan.application and submission informationapplicants must select the ic and associated foa to use for submission of an application in response to this nosi. the selection must align with the ic requirements listed in order to be considered responsive to that foa. non-responsive applications will not be considered for this initiative.in addition, applicants using nih parent announcements (listed below) will be assigned to those ics on this nosi that have indicated those foas are acceptable and based on usual application-ic assignment practices.• pa-20-183-nih research project grant (parent r01 clinical trial required)• pa-20-185-nih research project grant (parent r01 clinical trial not allowed)national institute on drug abuse (nida)nida is interested in research to evaluate behavioral treatments for substance use disorders (suds);

(please see https://www.nia.nih.gov/research/dbsr/stage-model-behavioral-intervention-development. interventions may be focused on individuals, dyads, families, communities, organizations, or systems.the purpose of the interventions to be developed may be, for example, to promote health and well-being, including emotional/behavioral well-being, (e.g., in caregivers of individuals with dementia), promote behaviors associated with health and well-being (e.g., exercise), establish and maintain high quality and nurturing close relationships, cope with age-related disorders, cope with stress, decrease pain, improve sleep hygiene, promote independence, help older individuals with declining memory improve their memory, prevent disease or disease progression, and prevent cognitive decline.nia is also interested in supporting alzheimer’s disease alzheimer’s disease-related dementias (ad/adrd)-focused research on interventions for care providers and also preliminary behavioral interventions focused at increasing long-term adherence to lifestyle interventions, such as diet and physical activity, that might delay the onset and progression of ad/adrd. applications focused on behavioral intervention development for people living with ad/adrd and/or their care partners are encouraged to submit to par-21-307 or par-21-308.nia is particularly interested in mechanism-focused intervention development research on underrepresented minorities, with the goal of determining the underlying principles of interventions that improve their health and well-being and serve to reduce health disparities.applicants are also encouraged to consider the ultimate scalability of interventions and may conduct preliminary research to adapt/modify interventions to streamline interventions, optimize the ability to deliver interventions with fidelity and/or improve real-world ease of implementation.nia’s foa’s for this nosi include the following or their subsequent reissued equivalents:activity codefoafirst available due dater21/r33par-20-070 -

particularly for chronic pain syndromes; reduction of prescription drug (opioid) use or abuse in patients with chronic pain; enhancement of medication adherence; treatment or prevention of post-traumatic stress (disorder), traumatic brain injury, sleep disorders or disturbances, anxiety, depression, obesity, and smoking; promotion of psychological resilience or wellbeing; and promotion of healthy eating and physical activity. for more details on nccih’s approach to funding clinical trials, including a description of our available foa’s, please see https://nccih.nih.gov/grants/funding/clinicaltrials.nccih foas for this nosi include the following or their subsequent reissued equivalents:activity codefoafirst available due dater34par-21-240 -
