sf424 (r&r) application guide, except where instructed to do otherwise (in this foa or in a notice from nih guide for grants and contracts).conformance to all requirements (both in the application guide and the foa) is required and strictly enforced. applicants must read and follow all application instructions in the application guide as well as any program-specific instructions noted in section iv. when the program-specific instructions deviate from those in the application guide, follow the program-specific instructions.applications that do not comply with these instructions may be delayed or not accepted for review.there are several options available to submit your application through grants.gov to nih and department of health and human services partners. you must use one of these submission options to access the application forms for this opportunity.backgroundit is clear that organ systems do not function in isolation, but rather interact extensively through a series of complex interconnecting signaling networks. importantly, organ dysfunctions not caused by acute infections or diseases are clinical signposts of aging. the increasing prevalence of dysfunctions in multiple organ systems with age, multimorbidities, and the fact that aging is a major cause of most chronic conditions and diseases, implicates age-related changes in communication among organs of the body. the mechanisms and consequences of such age-related changes in interorgan communication (ioc) are the focus of this funding opportunity announcement (foa). the timeliness and feasibility of a program on aging of ioc is enhanced by recent technological innovations that have created new approaches to explore the unexpected “endocrine functions” of tissues and have raised important new mechanistic questions about ioc. studies in this area of research have received little attention in the context of aging, representing a significant knowledge gap.the role of aging in crosstalk between organs and tissues has begun to receive some attention. for example, osteoporosis and sarcopenia are two age-related diseases that substantially affect the quality of life in the elderly and commonly coexist. initially, they were viewed as two independent diseases; however, mounting evidence from basic science and clinical data both suggest that age-related changes in spatial, metabolic, and dynamic interactions between bone and muscle contribute to their co-occurrence. beyond the bone-muscle interactions, bone and muscle cells both secrete factors, such as cytokines, myokines, and osteokines that influence physiological and pathological activities in local and distant cells and organs. in addition, recent studies have demonstrated that extracellular vesicles containing micrornas and other cargo derived from senescent skeletal muscle and bone cells can also be transported and participate in modulating or regulating interorgan crosstalk.in addition, extensive crosstalk between the kidney and bone has been recognized for decades and is one of the best and longest recognized examples of complex ioc in the context of disease but has received far less attention in aging — where it may be appreciated that chronic diseases are potential drivers of aging in multiple tissues. chronic kidney disease (ckd) is associated with a host of alterations in renal function and bone metabolic disorders, which markedly affect mineral homeostasis and bone remodeling. consequently, patients with ckd have increased bone fragility and a substantially increased risk of fractures compared with that of the general population. the downstream effects of renal dysfunction on mineral metabolism extend far beyond alterations in bone remodeling, however. for example, vascular calcification also occurs in response to disrupted mineral homeostasis and contributes to the high cardiovascular mortality associated with ckd.recent advances in geroscience research have highlighted the far-reaching effects of both aberrations in the normal function of the pillars of aging and the fact that these aberrations affect many different tissues in the body. neural function also changes with age and has been implicated in numerous alterations in homeostatic physiological regulation. sympathetic tone increases with age, whereas parasympathetic tone decreases with age. dysregulation of the autonomic nervous system (ans), another marker of aging, is associated with a variety of age-related diseases. thus, the complexity of the neural component in age-related changes in ioc may be extensive and highly complex. likewise, disruption of normal brain/peripheral organ crosstalk and surveillance seems likely to contribute to deficit accumulation and dysregulation in peripheral organs.purposethis foa invites applications to examine the molecular mechanisms and consequences of age-related alterations in ioc. elucidation of the mechanisms that modulate and coordinate organ interactions, and their changes with age, may provide new insights into multimorbidities. additionally, such research may provide a broader understanding of the complexity and heterogeneity of aging.objectivesthe goal of this foa is to promote research that examines the mechanisms of age-related alterations in ioc. changes in ioc are likely to contribute significantly to the heterogeneity of aging observed in all populations and are likely key factors leading to a range of multimorbidities. multimorbidities are a serious medical burden, are increasing globally as the proportion of people over 65 years of age continues to rise dramatically, and are of increasing importance in geroscience. accordingly, elucidation of the mechanisms that modulate and coordinate organ interactions, and their changes with age, may provide new insights into multimorbidities. further, such research may be essential to obtain a broader understanding of the complexity and heterogeneity of aging.this initiative focuses on discovering the molecular and cellular mechanisms that regulate aging dysfunction in the communication between two or more organ systems. although not strictly an organ system, studies may also include microbiomes.this foa focuses on molecular mechanisms of ioc explicitly in the context of aging. research that includes human participants, or that is informed by data of human conditions, is encouraged. however, since all models can provide important mechanistic insight, any animal species may be included. general areas of research could include, but are not limited to, studies on the molecular mechanisms and consequences of the following:the application must address differences in ioc between males and females.through this initiative, the national institute on aging (nia) endeavors to support research covering a wide range of at least pairwise combinations of organ systems. nia's aim, and the availability of funds, may impact the selection of sufficiently meritorious applications.to encourage collaborative investigations in this field, this foa utilizes the u01 research project – cooperative agreements activity code. given the broad scope of research applications that this foa is anticipated to generate, awardees will become part of a consortium to study basic mechanisms regulating ioc. the use of a consortium is advantageous to broadly share information on a variety of novel technologies that will be brought to bear by different awardees, such as cell topographical mapping, single-cell rna sequencing (scrnaseq), artificial intelligence (ai) and machine learning (ml) bioinformatics, and other state-of-the-art techniques that are used increasingly to study, and better understand, complex biological interactions. further, nia anticipates that this foa will attract investigators studying the molecular regulation of organ functions who are not currently working in aging research or ioc. a consortium would enhance the potential for productive inter-disciplinary communication among awardees, the exchange of data and information on methods and resources, and foster new avenues of investigation. the consortium will be unique as it would be the first of its kind focused on integrative physiology explicitly in the context of aging.nia staff interaction and meetingsprogram directors/principal investigators (pd(s)/pi(s)) and nia staff are expected to work collaboratively to achieve the aims proposed in the application. applications selected for funding will be assigned at least one nia scientific officer. the scientific officer(s) will advise and coordinate the science across all the awards and will organize workshops for awardees. during the workshops, pis and senior staff from each award will convene and collectively discuss their findings, technological opportunities and/or challenges, concerns, and emerging significant advances relevant to ioc. at least one workshop will be held every two years. workshops will be held in the bethesda, maryland area. workshops are expected to last for two days. applicants should include funds to support travel to workshops in their budget.non-responsiveness criteriathe following types of applications will be considered non-responsive, and will be withdrawn prior to review:see section viii. other information for award authorities and regulations.cooperative agreement: a support mechanism used when there will be substantial federal scientific or programmatic involvement. substantial involvement means that,

provisions currently in effect or implemented during the period of the award, other department regulations and policies in effect at the time of the award, and applicable statutory provisions.should the applicant organization successfully compete for an award, recipients of federal financial assistance (ffa) from hhs must administer their programs in compliance with federal civil rights laws that prohibit discrimination on the basis of race, color, national origin, disability, age and, in some circumstances, religion, conscience, and sex (including gender identity, sexual orientation, and pregnancy). this includes ensuring programs are accessible to persons with limited english proficiency and persons with disabilities. the hhs office for civil rights provides guidance on complying with civil rights laws enforced by hhs. please see https://www.hhs.gov/civil-rights/for-providers/provider-obligations/index.html and https://www.hhs.gov/civil-rights/for-individuals/nondiscrimination/index.htmlhhs recognizes that research projects are often limited in scope for many reasons that are nondiscriminatory, such as the principal investigator’s scientific interest, funding limitations, recruitment requirements, and other considerations. thus, criteria in research protocols that target or exclude certain populations are warranted where nondiscriminatory justifications establish that such criteria are appropriate with respect to the health or safety of the subjects, the scientific study design, or the purpose of the research. for additional guidance regarding how the provisions apply to nih grant programs, please contact the scientific/research contact that is identified in section vii under agency contacts of this foa.please contact the hhs office for civil rights for more information about obligations and prohibitions under federal civil rights laws at

defense authorization act of fiscal year 2009 (public law 110-417), nih awards will be subject to the federal awardee performance and integrity information system (fapiis) requirements. fapiis requires federal award making officials to review and consider information about an applicant in the designated integrity and performance system (currently fapiis) prior to making an award. an applicant, at its option, may review information in the designated integrity and performance systems accessible through fapiis and comment on any information about itself that a federal agency previously entered and is currently in fapiis. the federal awarding agency will consider any comments by the applicant, in addition to other information in fapiis, in making a judgement about the applicant’s integrity, business ethics, and record of performance under federal awards when completing the review of risk posed by applicants as described in 45 cfr part 75.205 and 2 cfr part 200.206 “federal awarding agency review of risk posed by applicants.” this provision will apply to all nih grants and cooperative agreements except fellowships.the following special terms of award are in addition to, and not in lieu of, otherwise applicable u.s. office of management and budget (omb) administrative guidelines, u.s. department of health and human services (dhhs) grant administration regulations at 45 cfr part 75 and 2 cfr part 200, and other hhs, phs, and nih grant administration policies. the administrative and funding instrument used for this program will be the cooperative agreement, an "assistance" mechanism (rather than an "acquisition" mechanism), in which substantial nih programmatic involvement with the recipients is anticipated during the performance of the activities. under the cooperative agreement, the nih purpose is to support and stimulate the recipients' activities by involvement in and otherwise working jointly with the recipients in a partnership role; it is not to assume direction, prime responsibility, or a dominant role in the activities. consistent with this concept, the dominant role and prime responsibility resides with the recipients for the project as a whole, although specific tasks and activities may be shared among the recipients and the nih as defined below.the pd(s)/pi(s) will have the primary responsibility for:nih staff have substantial programmatic involvement that is above and beyond the normal stewardship role in awards, as described below:areas of joint responsibility include:dispute resolution:any disagreements
