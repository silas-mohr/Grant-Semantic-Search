opportunity description section ii. award information section iii. eligibility information section iv. application and submission information section v. application review information section vi. award administration information section vii. agency contacts section viii. other informationbackground:the fda guidance, bioequivalence studies with pharmacokinetic endpoints for drugs submitted under an anda (aug 2021), provides recommendations for demonstrating the bioequivalence of additional strengths of a proposed modified release drug product. the guidance outlines that those additional strengths of the prospective generic (test) product may be demonstrated to be bioequivalent to the corresponding strengths of the reference standard based on acceptable in vivo bioequivalence studies on the bio-strength, similar dissolution profiles across strengths, the same drug release mechanism, and the same excipients for different strengths. in the earlier versions of the aforementioned guidance (i.e., 2013), the fda recommended that a prospective generic formulation should also be compositionally proportional in excipients across all strengths for the additional strengths to be considered equivalent to the bio-strength. the fda’s current thinking in the aug 2021 version of the guidance places less emphasis on compositional proportionality across strengths, and instead, recommends applicants justify that ratios of drug excipients across strengths are appropriate for the drug release mechanism. de-emphasizing the recommendation that modified release products be compositionally proportional across strengths provides greater flexibility to develop challenging generic modified release products while also involving more supporting evidence to demonstrate that a test product will have the same drug release mechanism and similar dissolution profiles across strengths.objectives:thus, the objectives of this project are to 1) determine the critical quality attributes for different release controlling platform technologies and 2) determine the appropriate factors to scale the formulation for additional strengths. the outcomes of this research are intended to provide tools that 1) facilitate the development of modified release generic drug products, 2) support regulatory decision making during the assessment of such products, and 3) provide evidence that enables fda to develop more specific recommendations for efficiently demonstrating the bioequivalence of modified release oral drug products with multiple strengths.detailed description:achieving these objectives will require a comprehensive understanding of the different modified release formulation design strategies (e.g., osmotic drug-delivery systems, extended release film coating tablets, and matrix systems). a fundamental understanding of modified release formulation design strategy from either a theoretical or experimental approach, or both, should be employed. in addition, additional factors (e.g., solubility properties of drugs) affecting drug release rate should be discussed.the intent of the cooperative agreement is that the award recipient will work collaboratively with fda scientists to refine the research strategy proposed by the applicant, develop study designs and protocols, orchestrate study conduct, analyze data and publish the results. the final research strategy would be developed based upon the innovation and expertise of the award recipient, in collaboration with feedback from the fda to ensure that the study designs are aligned with the objectives of the award.specific areas of scientific interest would include:1. construct a database with necessary variables (e.g., drug solubility and excipient impact) affecting drug release mechanism in different formulation design strategies.2. develop and assess drug product formulation design spaces using appropriate experimental response metrics (e.g., drug release controlling excipients identified).3. explore how new or existing dissolution methodologies can be utilized to characterize the drug release mechanism for different types of oral modified release drug products.4. develop physiologically based pharmacokinetic (pbpk) modeling and simulation tools to compare different strengths of proposed formulations (or approved generic products) and the corresponding reference standard product.note: the expectation is that the data generated as an outcome of this research award, including but not necessarily limited to any individual replicate/subject-level data (not just summary results), any model constructs and data sets, and/or any computer code that represents an outcome of the award should be shared with the fda office of generic drugs (ogd) prior to the completion of the award period, and it is strongly preferred that fda would explicitly be granted permission to make such data publicly available after a reasonable amount of time following the completion of the award period (e.g. 1 year after the end of the award period); the applicant's data sharing plan will specifically be considered when scoring the 'significance' of the application.see

notification in the form of a notice of award (noa) will be provided to the applicant organization for successful applications. the noa signed by the grants management officer is the authorizing document and will be sent via email to the recipient’s business official.recipients must comply with any funding restrictions described in section iv.5. funding restrictions and in the notice of

assistance (ffa) from hhs must administer their programs in compliance with federal civil rights laws that prohibit discrimination on the basis of race, color, national origin, disability, age and, in some circumstances, religion, conscience, and sex (including gender identify, sexual orientation, and pregnancy). this includes ensuring programs are accessible to persons with limited english proficiency and persons with disabilities. the hhs office for civil rights provides guidance on complying with civil rights laws enforced by hhs. please see https://www.hhs.gov/civil-rights/for-providers/provider-obligations/index.html and https://www.hhs.gov/civil-rights/for-individuals/nondiscrimination/index.htmlhhs recognizes that research projects are often limited in scope for many reasons that are nondiscriminatory, such as the principal investigator’s scientific interest, funding limitations, recruitment requirements, and other considerations. thus, criteria in research protocols that target or exclude certain populations are warranted where nondiscriminatory justifications establish that such criteria are appropriate with respect to the health or safety of the subjects, the scientific study design, or the purpose of the research. for additional guidance regarding how the provisions apply to fda grant programs, please contact the scientific/research contact that is identified in section vii under agency contacts of this foa.please contact the hhs office for civil rights for more information about obligations and

contained in section 872 of the duncan hunter national defense authorization act of fiscal year 2009 (public law 110-417), fda awards will be subject to the federal awardee performance and integrity information system (fapiis) requirements. fapiis requires federal award making officials to review and consider information about an applicant in the designated integrity and performance system (currently fapiis) prior to making an award. an applicant, at its option, may review information in the designated integrity and performance systems accessible through fapiis and comment on any information about itself that a federal agency previously entered and is currently in fapiis. the federal awarding agency will consider any comments by the applicant, in addition to other information in fapiis, in making a judgement about the applicant’s integrity, business ethics, and record of performance under federal awards when completing the review of risk posed by applicants as described in 45 cfr part 75.205 and 2 cfr part 200.206 “federal awarding agency review of risk posed by applicants.” this provision will apply to all fda grants and cooperative agreements.fda considers the sharing
