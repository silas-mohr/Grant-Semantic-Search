december 7, 2021par-21-167 - development of animal models and related biological materials for research (r21 clinical trial not allowed)division of program coordination, planning and strategic initiatives, office of research infrastructure programs (orip)backgroundthe success of developing drugs and other therapeutic approaches relies heavily on the use of animal models in preclinical studies. the rigor and reproducibility of animal models are recognized as key factors facilitating the translation of findings in animal studies to successful clinical trials. the office of research infrastructure programs (orip) convened a group of experts in broad areas of animal research for a workshop entitled “validation of animal models and tools for biomedical research” that was held as a series of virtual sessions between november 2020 and january 2021 (https://orip.nih.gov/about-orip/workshop-reports#vss). this workshop was organized by orip in collaboration with the national heart, lung, and blood institute (nhlbi), the national institute on aging (nia), the national institute of diabetes and digestive and kidney diseases (niddk), the national institute of general medical sciences (nigms), and the national institute of neurological disorders and stroke (ninds). the workshop participants identified technology and resource gaps and needs for assessing the value and limitations of animal models and for improving rigor, reproducibility, and translatability of animal research. the participants stressed the importance of, and need for, two-way communication between basic science researchers using animal models and clinical researchers and clinicians. the nih advisory committee to the director (acd) has recognized the importance of rigor and reproducibility in animal research in a working group report entitled “enhancing rigor, transparency, and translatability in animal research” (https://acd.od.nih.gov/documents/presentations/06112021_acd_workinggroup_presentation.pdf) published in june 2021.research objectiveswith this notice of special interest (nosi), orip intends to support exploratory/developmental and highly innovative projects aimed at developing broadly applicable technologies, tools, and resources for validating animal models and enhancing the rigor, reproducibility, and translatability of animal research. this nosi is for two-year projects that address key animal resource- and technology-related gaps identified in the “validation of animal models and tools for biomedical research” workshop organized by orip, nhlbi, nia, niddk, nigms, and ninds. animal models of interest for this nosi include, but are not limited to, invertebrate and vertebrate organisms ranging from c. elegans and drosophila to zebrafish, mouse, rat, pig, and nonhuman primates.orip advances the nih mission by supporting research infrastructure and research-related resource programs, including animal models and facilities for research relevant to human health and diseases (for more details see orip strategic plan for 2021-2025). proposed studies, models, resources, or technologies under this nosi must either address research interests of multiple nih institutes and centers (ics), explore multiple body or organ systems, or be applicable to diseases and processes that impact multiple body or organ systems. applications are not acceptable and will be withdrawn if they only address a specific disease or area of research, are relevant to the mission and programs of a single ic, or are related predominantly to the interest of one ic and only peripherally to the interests of other ics.examples of projects suitable for this foa include but are not limited to:projects that are not suitable for this nosi and would be deemed nonresponsive and withdrawn include but are not limited to:applications submitted under this nosi should aim to enhance the rigor, reproducibility, and translatability of animal research through the development of resources and technologies that have significant impact in a broad range of research areas using animal models. applications must demonstrate how the proposed animal models and technologies impact rigor and reproducibility of animal research. demonstration of the impact of the proposed project on translatability is not required but is a strength.investigators interested in submitting applications are strongly encouraged to contact orip program staff before submission to discuss whether their research plans are appropriate for and responsive to this nosi. applications with projects outside the areas of interests of this nosi will be considered nonresponsive and will be administratively withdrawn.application and submission informationthe due dates and expiration dates of par-21-167 and its re-issue apply to this notice.submit applications for this initiative using one of the following funding opportunity announcements (foas) or any reissues of these announcement through the expiration date of this notice.all instructions in the sf424 (r&r) application guide and the funding opportunity announcement used for submission must be followed, with the following additions:applications nonresponsive to terms of this nosi will not be considered for the nosi
