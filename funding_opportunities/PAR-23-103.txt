pilot work for subsequent studies testing the effectiveness of strategies to deliver evidence-based mental health services, treatment interventions, and/or preventive interventions (ebps) in low-resourced mental health specialty and non-specialty settings within the united states. the foa targets settings where ebps are not currently delivered or delivered with fidelity, such that there are disparities in mental health and related functional outcomes (e.g., employment, educational attainment, stable housing, integration in the community, treatment of comorbid substance use disorders) for the population(s) served. implementation strategies should identify and use innovative approaches to remediate barriers to provision, receipt, and/or benefit from ebps and generate new information about factors integral to achieving equity in mental health outcomes for underserved populations. research generating new information about factors causing/reducing disparities is strongly encouraged, including due consideration for the needs of individuals across the life span. applications proposing definitive tests of an implementation strategy should respond to the companion r01 announcement

these submission options to access the application forms for this opportunity.purposethis funding opportunity announcement (foa) supports pilot work in support of subsequent studies testing the effectiveness of strategies to deliver evidence-based mental health services, treatment interventions, and/or preventive interventions (ebps) in low-resource mental health specialty and non-specialty settings within the united states. the foa targets settings where ebps are not currently delivered or delivered with fidelity, such that there are disparities in mental health and related functional outcomes (e.g., employment, educational attainment, stable housing, integration in the community, treatment of co-morbid substance use disorders) for the population(s) served. implementation strategies should identify and use innovative approaches to remediate barriers to provision, receipt, and/or benefit from ebps and generate new information about factors integral to achieving equity in mental health outcomes for under-served populations. research generating new information about factors causing/reducing disparities is strongly encouraged, including due consideration for the needs of individuals across the life span.backgroundevidence-based mental health services, treatment interventions, and preventive interventions (ebps) are effective in improving clinical and functional outcomes for a wide variety of people with mental illness across the life span. ample evidence suggests, however, that ebps are often not delivered in low-resource settings and in settings where clients are predominantly from traditionally under-served populations. these populations are also more likely to have worse mental health outcomes, and more inpatient hospitalizations and emergency room use for psychiatric crises. while the prevalence of some mental disorders may be lower among some minorities, the course of illness is often more severe, persistent, and disabling. recent research also suggests that disparities in receipt of mental health treatment and services may be increasing. based on these findings, this foa solicits pilot work in support of future, larger scale research intended to improve access to evidence-based mental health care in low-resource areas and for under-served populations as a strategy for achieving greater equity in mental health and related functional outcomes and reducing disparities.research objectivesthis initiative supports pilot work in support of subsequent studies testing the effectiveness of strategies to deliver ebps in low-resource settings in the united states, in order to reduce disparities in mental health and related functional outcomes (e.g., employment, educational attainment, stable housing, integration in the community, treatment of co-morbid substance use disorders) for the population(s) served. of interest are settings where a significant number of children, youth, adults, or older adults with or at risk for mental illnesses can be found and evidence-based mental health treatments or services are not currently delivered.applications focused on developmental work that would enhance the probability of success in subsequent larger scale projects are also encouraged.developmental work might include refining details of the implementation approach; examining the feasibility of novel approaches and technologies; examining the feasibility of data collection including administration of instruments, obtaining administrative or other types of data, etc.; enhancing the protocol for the comparison group and randomization procedures (if appropriate); examining the feasibility of recruiting and retaining participants into the study condition(s); and developing and testing supportive materials such as training curricula. therefore, the collection of preliminary data regarding feasibility, acceptability and engagement of intervention targets is appropriate. however, given the intended pilot nature of the r34 activity code, conducting fully powered tests of outcomes or attempting to obtain an estimate of an effect size may not be feasible.the goal of this initiative is to conduct pilot work in support of subsequent studies that develop and test the effectiveness of scalable implementation strategies to achieve delivery of ebps with high fidelity in low-resource settings and significantly improve clinical and functional outcomes toward greater equity with outcomes documented in the general population. applications proposing definitive tests of an implementation strategy should respond to the companion r01 announcement: par-23-092.for the purposes of this foa, nimh uses the following definitions:pilot work might include developing strategies for delivery of ebps that focus on: access, quality/fidelity of care delivery, patient/family engagement, care management and coordination, or other innovative strategies and are empirically or theoretically justified. implementation strategies might address ebp delivery barriers at one or more of the following: provider-, clinic-, organizational-, within- or cross-systems levels.pilot studies submitted to this foa should be structured to inform future studies of whether and how the implementation strategy achieves delivery of the ebp with fidelity, and measurement of whether receipt of ebp leads to improved mental health and related functional outcomes for the intended population(s). relevant pilot work might include preliminary assessment of the feasibility, usability, and acceptability of 1) measuring change in the targeted proximal factors (e.g., consumer- or provider-behaviors, and or organizational-/system level factors); 2) measuring fidelity in delivery of the ebp(s); 3) measuring improvement in clinical and functional outcomes in the populations served; and 4) any other factors relevant that will strengthen the success of a future larger scale study of sustained delivery of ebps in under-resourced settings and determine the mechanisms that contribute to reducing or eliminating disparities through improved clinical and related functional outcomes.in addition, it is expected that the application/scope of work should be formulated following nimh requirements for clinical trials (see: support for clinical trials at nimh) and should address the following elements: 1) empirical/conceptual basis for the selection of the proximal targets of the implementation strategy, 2) plans for assessing preliminary changes in those proximal targets, and 3) plans for preliminary examination of whether changes in the targets are associated with more distal changes in clinical and functional outcomes that contribute to reducing disparities.proposed studies are expected to test models, theories, and conceptual frameworks of the implementation process that account for the available resources of the targeted care settings and the potential for cross-system collaboration(s), using a deployment-focused approach that takes into account the perspective and needs of multiple stakeholders, including end-users. to that end, it may be productive to involve collaborations with and/or input from community partners including consumers, families, providers, administrators, payers and/or policy-makers to inform the research and help ensure that the ultimate results will have utility. the tested approaches should be developed with consideration for the realistic constraints in organizational structure, provider availability and training, organizational or provider capacity and other relevant factors specific to the type of under-resourced setting being addressed. studies should be formulated to contribute generalizable strategies that, if effective, can be rapidly disseminated and implemented across a broad range of real-world settings.nimh encourages research that utilizes novel technology to assist in the implementation, fidelity, delivery, and feedback of clinical and organizational processes in the implementation of ebps (see not-mh-18-031). when indicated, strategies should incorporate health information technology (hit) and electronic health records (ehr) to coordinate care and monitor outcomes.a variety of methodologically rigorous approaches may be indicated for a future study testing the impact of the implementation strategy being developed, and pilot work should be designed in support of a future study design. approaches may include randomized controlled trials (rcts), quasi-experimental designs with non-randomized comparison groups, time series designs, and other designs of equivalent rigor and relevance. pilot studies should be designed to inform and test the feasibility of the research design for a subsequent, adequately powered test of the implementation strategy (e.g., determining whether randomization is feasible), taking into account practical constraints, ethical issues, and the trade-off between maximizing internal and external validity.it is anticipated that pilot work funded by this foa will lead to larger studies that substantially contribute to the development of new, generalizable knowledge regarding strategies to reduce or eliminate disparities in mental health outcomes and functioning. given this goal, applicants should propose pilot work that clarifies optimal and feasible approaches to measuring disparities reduction, keeping in mind that effectiveness in reducing disparities may be best demonstrated via examination of post-implementation outcomes/effect sizes among underrepresented, under-served individuals in comparison to those achieved in published research in the general population or through comparisons among subgroups. applicants are strongly encouraged to propose ebp implementation strategies that identify factors that facilitate sustainability (e.g., utilization of existing personnel or realignment of responsibilities to facilitate implementation, effective financing strategies, response to staff turn-over, technological factors, etc.), scalability, and generalizability to other settings or geographic regions.areas of interest include, but are not limited to:support for full scale studies of the effectiveness of implementation strategies should be submitted via par-23-092.applications not responsive to this foaapplications will be

(r&r) application guide must be followed, with the following additional instructions:to advance the goal of advancing research through widespread data sharing among researchers, investigators funded under this foa are expected to share those data via the national institute of mental health data archive (nda; see not-mh-19-033). established by the nih, nda is a secure informatics platform for scientific collaboration and data-sharing that enables the effective communication of detailed research data, tools, and supporting documentation. nda links data across research projects through its global unique identifier (guid) and data dictionary technology. investigators funded under this foa are expected to use these technologies to submit data to nda.to accomplish this objective, it will be important to formulate a) an enrollment strategy that will obtain the information necessary to generate a guid for each participant, and b) a budget strategy that will cover the costs of data submission. the nda web site provides two tools to help investigators develop appropriate strategies: 1) the nda data submission cost model which offers a customizable excel worksheet that includes tasks and hours for the program director/principal investigator and data manager to budget for data sharing; and 2) plain language text to be considered in your informed consent available from the nda's data contribution page. investigators are expected to certify the quality of all data generated by grants funded under this foa prior to submission to nda and review their data for accuracy after submission. submission of descriptive/raw data is expected semi-annually (every january 15 and july 15); submission of all other data is expected at the time of publication, or prior to the end of the grant, whichever occurs first (see nda sharing regimen for more information); investigators are expected to share results, positive and negative, specific to the cohorts and outcome measures studied. the nda data sharing plan is available for review on the nda website. nda staff will work with investigators to help them submit data types not yet defined in the nda data dictionary.only limited appendix materials are allowed. follow all instructions for the appendix as described in the sf424 (r&r) application guide.when involving human subjects research, clinical research, and/or

errors.upon receipt, applications will be evaluated for completeness and compliance with application instructions by the center for scientific review and responsiveness by national institute of mental health, nih. applications that are incomplete, non-compliant and/or non-responsive will not be reviewed.use of common data elements in nih-funded researchmany nih ics encourage the use of common data elements (cdes) in basic, clinical, and applied research, patient registries, and other human subject research to facilitate broader and more effective use of data and advance research across studies. cdes are data elements that have been identified and defined for use in multiple data sets across different studies. use of cdes can facilitate data sharing and standardization to improve data quality and enable data integration from multiple studies and sources, including electronic health records. nih ics have identified cdes for many clinical domains (e.g., neurological disease), types of studies (e.g. genome-wide association studies (gwas)), types of outcomes (e.g., patient-reported outcomes), and patient registries (e.g., the global rare diseases patient registry and data repository). nih has established a “common data element (cde) resource portal" (http://cde.nih.gov/) to assist investigators in identifying nih-supported cdes when developing protocols, case report forms, and other instruments for data collection. the portal provides guidance about and access to nih-supported cde initiatives and other tools and resources for the appropriate use of cdes and data standards in nih-funded research. investigators are encouraged to consult the portal and describe in their applications any use they will make of nih-supported cdes in their projects.nimh has released expectations for collecting common data elements when an application involves human research participants. details can be found at not-mh-20-067 and the nimh webpage on data sharing for applicants and awardees.applicants are required to follow the instructions for post-submission materials, as described in the policy1. criteriaonly the review criteria described below will be considered in the
