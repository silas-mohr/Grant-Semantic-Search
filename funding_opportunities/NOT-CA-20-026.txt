identify structural, systemic, and psychosocial barriers to adherence; and/or develop models and strategies to improve safe and effective delivery of oral anticancer agents. research may be focused at the patient (pediatric, adolescent, young adult, and/or adult), patient-caregiver dyad, provider, health care team, and/or health care delivery system levels. research that merges expertise from diverse areas of science and clinical disciplines (e.g., pharmacy, nursing, oncology, primary care) or is focused on molecularly targeted agents is not required, but strongly encouraged. addressing the needs of groups subject to disparities, such as the elderly or medically underserved, is an nci priority.areas of interest include, but are not limited to, research that falls in one or more of the following three categories.utilization:adherence:care delivery:application and submission informationthis notice applies to due dates on or after june 5, 2020, and subsequent receipt dates through january 8, 2023.submit applications for this initiative using one of the following funding opportunity announcements (foas) or any reissues of these announcements through the expiration date of this noticefoa titlejune 5, 2020june 5, 2020november 6, 2020june 5, 2020june 16, 2020june 16, 2020june 16, 2020june 16, 2020may 25, 2020all instructions in the sf424 (r&r) application guide and the funding opportunity announcement used for submission must be followed, with the following additions:although nci is not listed as a participating organization in all the foas listed above, applications for this initiative will be accepted.inquiriesplease direct all inquiries to:scientific/research contact:wendy nelson, ph.d., m.p.h. national cancer institute (nci) telephone: 240-276-6971 email: nelsonw@mail.nih.govpeer review contact(s):examine your era commons account for review assignment and contact information (information appears two weeks after the submission due date).financial/grants management contact:carol perry national cancer institute office of grants administration telephone: 240-276-6282 email: perryc@mail.nih.gov weekly toc for this announcement nih funding opportunities and noticesnote: for help accessing pdf, rtf, ms word, excel, powerpoint, audio or video files, see help downloading files.
