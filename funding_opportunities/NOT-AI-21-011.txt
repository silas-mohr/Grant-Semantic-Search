Notice of Special Interest (NOSI): Secondary Analysis of Existing Datasets for Advancing Immune-mediated and Infectious Disease Research
february 12, 2021pa-20-195 - nih exploratory/developmental research grant program (parent r21 clinical trial not allowed)national institute of allergy and infectious diseases (niaid) national institute of mental health (nimh)national institute of mental health (nimh)this notice of special interest (nosi) is to support projects that use data, alone or in combination, to address scientific questions and knowledge gaps in basic or clinical research in immune-mediated and infectious diseases.backgroundniaid has invested in the generation of data and data resources to better inform understanding of risk for immune-mediated and infectious diseases, their progression, treatment, and prevention. these data are available through various niaid and nih funded repositories, knowledgebases, as well as other publicly available data resources (a list of exemplar resources is available at https://www.niaid.nih.gov/research/data-science-resources-researchers).many of these data have potential utility beyond the specific hypotheses and questions for which they were originally generated. their reuse fosters a research paradigm that leverages data to generate and/or refine hypotheses prior to experimental design. moreover, further investigation of existing data sets, alone or in combination with other data, also provides opportunities to answer novel research questions at relatively low cost and justifies the value of investments made by niaid/nih and other funders in the repositories and knowledgebases for research use. the resulting studies might also reveal any barriers to data reuse and help identify tools needed and/or metadata that could be collected that will better enable data reuse by the broader community.principles of data sharing which state that data should be findable, accessible, interoperable and re-usable (fair) form the premise of the nih strategic plan for data science. niaid is committed to the management and sharing of data in alignment with these principles and to exploring how current niaid repositories, knowledgebases, tools and other resources may need to be re-configured to coexist in a truly interoperable and usable research data ecosystem.research objectivesthis nosi invites applications proposing innovative informatics/data science projects that seek to answer novel scientific questions and address knowledge gaps in basic, translational and clinical, immune-mediated and infectious diseases by using data in repositories and knowledgebases. the projects may combine data from a variety of repositories and/or knowledgebases funded by niaid in addition to other sources, including controlled-access and private user-generated data. the research focus areas of the applications must include infectious diseases, emerging infections, basic immunology or immune-mediated disease (i.e. allergy, autoimmunity, or immune reactions associated with transplantation). aids applications can additionally propose research using existing datasets to examine the interaction of mental health and mental health comorbidities, stigma, and other social behavioral determinants of health on hiv-related outcomes.applications submitted in response to this nosi must:relevant topics include, but are not limited to:applications will be considered non-responsive to this nosi if the applications:applicants are encouraged to contact the scientific/research staff listed below to ensure proposed projects are within the scope of this nosi initiative.application and submission informationthis notice applies to due dates on or after june 16, 2021 and subsequent receipt dates through may 7, 2024.submit applications for this initiative using one of the following funding opportunity announcements (foas) or any reissues of these announcement through the expiration date of this notice.all instructions in the sf424 (r&r) application guide and the funding opportunity announcement used for submission must be followed, with the following additions: although nimh is not listed as a participating organization in all the foas listed above, applications for this initiative will be accepted.applications nonresponsive to terms of this nosi will be withdrawn from consideration for this initiative.scientific/research contact(s)office of data science and emerging technologies (odset) national institute for allergy and infectious diseases (niaid) email: datascience-foa@niaid.nih.govlori a.j. scott-sheldon, ph.d. division of aids research national institute of mental health (nimh) telephone: 301-792-2309 email: lori.scott-sheldon@nih.gov weekly toc for this announcement nih funding opportunities and noticesnote: for help accessing pdf, rtf, ms word, excel, powerpoint, audio or video files, see help downloading files.
