research (obssr)ug3/uh3 exploratory/developmental phased award cooperative agreementsee notices of special interest associated with this funding opportunitysee section iii. 3. additional information on eligibility.the purpose of this funding opportunity announcement (foa) is to encourage investigators to pursue translational activities and clinical feasibility studies to advance the development of therapeutic, and diagnostic devices for disorders that affect the nervous or neuromuscular systems.activities supported in this program include implementation of clinical prototype devices, non-clinical safety and efficacy testing, design verification and validation activities, obtaining an investigational device exemption (ide) for a significant risk (sr) study or institutional review board (irb) approval for a non-significant risk (nsr) study, as well as a subsequent clinical feasibility study. the clinical study is expected to provide information about the device function or final design that cannot be practically obtained through additional non-clinical assessments (e.g., bench top or animal studies) due to the novelty of the device or its intended use. this foa is a milestone-driven cooperative agreement program and will involve participation of nih program staff in negotiating the final project plan before award and monitoring of research progress.participants in blueprint medtech receive funding for all activities to be conducted in their own laboratories. in addition, applicants will collaborate with nih-funded consultants to receive assistance with specialty areas including regulatory, reimbursement, intellectual property, commercialization, and strategic partnerships. participants can also augment their project with nih contract research organizations that specialize in large animal testing, sterilization testing, biocompatibility assessment, manufacturing, and medical monitoring.individuals, institutions, or businesses developing their own devices or that already have established collaborations with device manufacturers are welcome to apply directly to this foa or any of the companion opportunities. for more information see bp

which 14 nih institutes, centers and offices jointly support neuroscience-related research, with the aim of accelerating discoveries and reducing the burden of nervous system disorders (for further information, see http://neuroscienceblueprint.nih.gov/).innovators developing groundbreaking medical device technologies face a number of challenges along the translational path from bench to bedside. the blueprint medtech program is an nih incubator that aims to address such challenges and support the innovators by accelerating the development of cutting-edge medical devices to diagnose and treat disorders of the nervous system. the mission of the program is to catalyze the translation of novel neurotechnologies from early-stage development to first-in-human clinical studies. the program will provide: (a) non-dilutive funds to support medical device development activities led by investigators, and (b) additional resources and support services including, but not limited to:the overarching goal of the blueprint medtech program is to accelerate patient access to groundbreaking, safe, and effective medical devices. the program will provide support to sufficiently develop and de-risk technologies to the point where additional investments are warranted from industry partners, investors, and government.a. overviewthe purpose of this funding opportunity announcement (foa) is to support grantees in pursuing translational activities and clinical studies to advance the development of therapeutic, and diagnostic devices for disorders that affect the nervous or neuromuscular systems. activities supported by this foa include implementation of clinical prototype devices, non-clinical safety and effectiveness testing, design verification and validation activities. additional activities include obtaining an investigational device exemption (ide) for a significant risk (sr) study or institutional review board (irb) approval for a non-significant risk (nsr) study, as well as support for a subsequent clinical feasibility study. the clinical study is expected to provide information about the device function or final design that cannot be practically obtained through additional non-clinical assessments (e.g., bench top or animal studies) due to the novelty of the device or its intended use.all projects must have two phases: ug3 and uh3. the ug3 phase will support non-clinical testing to obtain an ide and irb approval for an sr clinical study, or to obtain irb approval for an nsr clinical study. all projects will start at the ug3 phase. the duration of the ug3 phase will depend on the maturity of the project at entry and can range from one to four years. only those ug3 phase projects that have met specific criteria (see below) will transition to the uh3 phase after nih administrative review. the uh3 phase will support a clinical feasibility study and can last one to four years, however, the total project period (including both the ug3 and uh3 phases) must not exceed five years. furthermore, ethical considerations are intrinsic to the responsible conduct of neuroscience research and the translation of neuroscience advances (scientific and technological) into clinical practice. projects for which only a clinical phase is proposed are outside of the scope of this funding opportunity.this foa utilizes a ug3/uh3 cooperative agreement mechanism. as a cooperative agreement, this foa supports milestone-driven projects and involves nih program staff’s participation in negotiating project and milestones plan before award, monitoring the research progress, and making go/no-go decisions. the expectations of the program are in line with those of industry regarding the advancement of devices through the developmental and translational pipelines. as such, an inherent rate of attrition is possible within this program.an objective of this program is to foster and encourage participation in innovation and entrepreneurship by socially and economically disadvantaged persons and women-owned small businesses. this par encourages applications from diverse teams of investigators,including team members that are underrepresented in the biomedical, behavioral, or clinical research workforce(see data at http://www.nsf.gov/statistics/showpub.cfm?topid=2&subid=27 and the most recent report on women, minorities, and persons with disabilities in science and engineering). such individuals include those from underrepresented racial and ethnic groups, those with disabilities, and those from disadvantaged backgrounds.b. scopeprojects must focus on a disorder that falls within the mission of participating nih blueprint institutes and centers. it is expected that devices within the scope of this program either:c. entry criteriaapplicants to the blueprint medtech program must include novel medical device technologies that will advance upon current neurotechnology (see non-responsive criteria below).applicants should clearly define the current state of the art and highlight how their proposed technology will advance patient care. responsive applications should propose medical devices, expected to be regulated by the fda, with first-of-its-kind technologies, unique and novel intended use, new safety questions, and/or new regulatory questions. responsive applications may also pivot and refine existing technologies toward new intended use and/or use in novel settings (e.g., innovating and translating a neuromodulation device approved for healthcare-setting only to home-use).proposed medical devices and their indications will likely follow de novo or premarket approval (pma) regulatory pathways. medical devices with indications that may fit within an existing 510(k) pathway may also be accepted, as long as the application can demonstrate a clear clinical and technological innovation beyond the state of the art of existing fda-cleared predicates. such devices should be reasonably expected to provide new clinically meaningful diagnostic or therapeutic options or improve the benefit-risk profile of a treatment or diagnostic through substantial safety innovations.for entry to the program, projects should have:applicants are encouraged, but not required, to consult with fda via a pre-submission meeting, study risk designation request, and/or 513(g) submission prior to applying for funding through this grant mechanism. applicants who do not have sufficiently relevant feedback from the fda regarding all planned activities prior to application for funding will be expected to do so as the first milestone of the ug3 phase of the award. funding may be restricted to a maximum of $100,000 in direct costs until fda feedback that is consistent with the likely success of the regulatory path to market and overall device development plan outlined in the grant application is received. in the event that fda feedback is not consistent with the plans in the grant, program staff will evaluate the concerns and change of scope that would be needed and work with the investigators to determine the most appropriate course of action. any remaining funds associated with the original award will not be released.d. phasesug3 phase: examples of studies that may be proposed during the ug3 phase include, but are not limited touh3 phase:the uh3 phase will support a clinical study that will lead to either:examples of studies that can be proposed during the clinical phase include, but are not limited to:e. non-responsive activitiesapplications that include the following activities will be considered non-responsive and will be withdrawn and not reviewed:applications that do not include the following other attachments will be considered incomplete:it is recommended that applicants reach out to the nih program staff listed at the bottom of this funding opportunity to discuss responsiveness criteria with respect to proposed technologies and indications.f. milestonesbecause device development is inherently risky, it is anticipated that there may be attrition as projects progress. applications must propose one or more milestones for each objective in each year of the project. milestones are goals that quantitatively measure success and efficacy that will be used for go/no-go decision-making for the project (see below for details).for each milestone, provide details on methods, assumptions, experimental designs, and data and statistical analysis plans (if the results are quantitatively measured). specify the quantitative criteria for measuring success and the rationale used to develop and justify the quantitative criteria identified. quantitative criteria should be robust and consistent with the state-of-the-art in the field. applicants are encouraged to read examples of milestones (e.g., https://www.ninds.nih.gov/funding/apply-funding/application-support-library/devices-milestones).nih program staff will contact the applicant to discuss the project and any changes prior to funding the application, including negotiation of the proposed milestones. the final agreed upon and approved milestones will be specified in the notice of award (noa). progress towards achievement of the final set of milestones will be evaluated yearly by nih program staff. program staff may involve independent consultants or subject matter experts with relevant expertise. if justified, future milestones may be revised based on data and information obtained during the previous project period. if, based on the progress report, a funded project does not meet the milestones, funding for the project will be discontinued. in addition to milestones, the decision regarding continued funding will also be based on the overall robustness of the entire data package that adequately allows an interpretation of the results (regardless if they have been captured in the milestones), overall progress, portfolio balance and program priorities, competitive landscape, and availability of funds.nih encourages increasing the rigor and reproducibility of observed results. in some cases, conducting additional critical experiments will be important for nih to have confidence in making a funding decision.ug3 phase to uh3 phase transition:an administrative review will be conducted by program staff, with potential input by independent consultants, to decide whether a ug3 phase project will be transitioned into the uh3 phase based on the following:g. quality and compliance requirementthe use of the design control and quality systems processes (https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/design-control-guidance-medical-device-manufacturers) to the degree specified by the fda is required. intermediate steps in the design control process (e.g., design reviews, design verification, design validation, and design transfer activities) where appropriate, and ide submission should be represented in the annual milestones. nih recognizes that the degree to which design controls and quality systems processes are required by the fda may vary substantially depending on the specific device. investigators are encouraged to discuss these issues with the fda and regulatory consultants prior to submitting an application so the extent to which these processes are required is clearly defined and verifiable in the application. applicants should consider the quality system requirements at the ide stage (i.e., design controls) when preparing their device development activities. applicants should consider guidelines and policies for monitoring clinical research in the formation of a plan for data and safety monitoring as required by the appropriate ic.h. intellectual property (ip)since the ultimate goal of this program is to bring new therapeutic and diagnostic devices to the market, the program strongly encourages the awardees and/or their collaborators to obtain and retain any ip developed around the device during the project period (see instructions on attachment or letters to address ip issues in section iv). recipients of awards are encouraged to identify and foster relationships with potential licensing and commercialization partners early in the device development process. the pd/pi(s) are expected to work closely with technology transfer officials at their institution to ensure that royalty agreements, patent filings, and all other necessary intellectual property arrangements are completed in a timely manner and that commercialization plans are developed and updated over the course of the project. for rare or ultra- rare diseases where commercialization may be challenging, applicants are encouraged to discuss alternative strategies with scientific/research staff to get further guidance.i. pre-application consultationas an ug3/uh3 cooperative agreement, nih program staff will be involved in the negotiation and execution of the projects. applicants are strongly encouraged to consult with nih program staff when planning an application. early contact provides an opportunity for staff to provide further guidance on program scope, goals, and developing appropriate milestones. when possible, applicants should contact program staff at least 12 weeks before a receipt date.j. institute statements of

defense authorization act of fiscal year 2009 (public law 110-417), nih awards will be subject to the federal awardee performance and integrity information system (fapiis) requirements. fapiis requires federal award making officials to review and consider information about an applicant in the designated integrity and performance system (currently fapiis) prior to making an award. an applicant, at its option, may review information in the designated integrity and performance systems accessible through fapiis and comment on any information about itself that a federal agency previously entered and is currently in fapiis. the federal awarding agency will consider any comments by the applicant, in addition to other information in fapiis, in making a judgement about the applicant’s integrity, business ethics, and record of performance under federal awards when completing the review of risk posed by applicants as described in 45 cfr part 75.205 “federal awarding agency review of risk posed by applicants.” this provision will apply to all nih grants and cooperative agreements except fellowships.the following special terms of award are in addition to, and not in lieu of, otherwise applicable u.s. office of management and budget (omb) administrative guidelines, u.s. department of health and human services (dhhs) grant administration regulations at 45 cfr part 75,, 2 cfr part 200 and other hhs, phs, and nih grant administration policies. the administrative and funding instrument used for this program will be the cooperative agreement, an "assistance" mechanism (rather than an "acquisition" mechanism), in which substantial nih programmatic involvement with the recipients is anticipated during the performance of the activities. under the cooperative agreement, the nih purpose is to support and stimulate the recipients' activities by involvement in and otherwise working jointly with the award recipients in a partnership role; it is not to assume direction, prime responsibility, or a dominant role in the activities. consistent with this concept, the dominant role and prime responsibility reside with the recipients for the project as a whole, although specific tasks and activities may be shared among the recipients and the nih as defined below. the pd(s)/pi(s) will have the primary responsibility for:nih staff have substantial programmatic involvement that is above and beyond the normal stewardship role in awards, as described below:collaborative responsibilities:dispute resolution:any disagreements that may arise in scientific or programmatic matters (within the scope of the award) between award recipients and the nih may be brought to dispute resolution. a dispute resolution panel composed of three members will be convened. it will have three members: a designee for the investigators chosen without nih staff voting, one nih designee, and a third designee with expertise in the relevant area who is chosen by the other two; in the case of disagreement, the first member may be chosen by the individual recipient this special dispute resolution procedure does not alter the recipient's right to appeal an adverse action that is otherwise appealable in accordance with phs regulation 42 cfr part 50, subpart d and dhhs regulation 45 cfr part 16. final decisions made by nih regarding a discontinuation are not appealable.data

data management and sharing is applicable to the award, recipients will be required to adhere to the data management and sharing requirements as outlined in the nih grants policy statement. upon the approval of a data management and sharing plan, it is required for recipients to implement the plan as described.when multiple years are involved, recipients will be required to submit the research performance progress report (rppr) annually and financial statements as required in the nih grants policy statement.a final rppr, invention statement, and the expenditure data portion of the federal financial report are required for closeout of an award, as described in the nih grants policy statement.the federal funding accountability and transparency act of 2006 (transparency act), includes a requirement for recipients of federal grants to report information about first-tier subawards and executive compensation under federal assistance awards issued in fy2011 or later. all recipients of applicable nih grants and cooperative agreements are required to report to the federal subaward reporting system (fsrs) available at www.fsrs.gov on all subawards over $25,000. see the nih grants policy statement for additional information on this reporting requirement.in accordance with the regulatory requirements provided at 45 cfr 75.113 and appendix xii to 45 cfr part 75, recipients that have currently active federal grants, cooperative agreements, and procurement contracts from all federal awarding agencies with a cumulative total value greater than $10,000,000 for any period of time during the period of performance of a federal award, must report and maintain the currency of information reported in the system for award management (sam) about civil, criminal, and administrative proceedings in connection with the award or performance of a federal award that reached final disposition within the most recent five-year period. the recipient must also make semiannual disclosures regarding such proceedings. proceedings information will be made publicly available in the designated integrity and performance system (currently fapiis). this is a statutory requirement under section 872 of public law 110-417, as amended (41 u.s.c. 2313). as required by section 3010 of public law 111-212, all information posted in the designated integrity and performance system on or after april
