"sexual and gender minority" is an umbrella term that encompasses lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender populations as well as those whose sexual orientation, gender identity and expressions, or reproductive development varies from traditional, societal, cultural, or physiological norms. this includes individuals with disorders or differences of sex development (dsd), sometimes known as intersex.although there has been an increase in sgm-focused health research in recent years, there remains a need for further research on the health of these populations. this notice encourages research that describes the biological, clinical, behavioral, and social processes that affect the health and development of sgm populations and individuals and their families, and that leads to the development of acceptable and appropriate health interventions and health service delivery methods that will enhance health and development of these populations.types of research which are relevant to this notice include, but are not limited to:possible funding opportunity announcements (foas) or their re-issues to which sgm-related research may be submitted include but are not limited to parent foas for research (r), career development (k), and fellowship (f) awards (see "parent announcements (for unsolicited or investigator initiated applications)": https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/parent_announcements.htm.applicants should carefully note the participating institutes/centers on each foa. applications must be in the mission of an institute/center listed in components of participating organizations on the foa. offices listed on this notice may consider co-funding applications assigned to an institute/center that participates on the foa.investigators are strongly encouraged to reach out to the relevant contacts as listed below to identify which foas may be most appropriate for their proposed project or application.applicants should indicate the notice number (not-md-19-001) in field 4.b on the sf 424 application form and refer to not-md-19-001 in the abstract to assist in identifying applications submitted to this notice.areas of programmatic interest to nimhd include but are not limited to:nimhd encourages projects to use approaches that encompass multiple domains (e.g., biological, behavioral, socio-cultural, environmental, physical environment, health system) and multiple levels (e.g., individual, interpersonal, community, societal) to understand and address health disparities in sgm populations (see the nimhd research framework, https://www.nimhd.nih.gov/about/overview/research-framework.html, for examples of health determinants of interest). animal studies and studies focused on sgm populations outside of the us are not priorities for nimhd under this notice.nccih is interested in supporting research on the use of complementary and integrative health approaches, including natural products and mind and body interventions, to manage stress, chronic pain, mild anxiety, or depression among sgm populations. nccih is also interested in research studying mind and body approaches to improve adherence to treatment (e.g., medication assisted treatment (mat) for opioid misuse, antiretroviral therapy (art) for hiv) and prevention (e.g., pre-exposure prophylaxis (prep) for hiv) regimens to promote health outcomes. natural products include botanicals, pre/probiotics, and products marketed as dietary supplements. mind and body approaches include various meditation approaches (e.g., mindfulness), hypnosis or guided imagery, meditative movement approaches (e.g., yoga, tai chi, qi-gong), body-based approaches (e.g., spinal manipulation, massage, mobilization, acupuncture), a combination of these approaches (e.g., meditation and yoga, such as in mindfulness-based stress reduction mbsr), or complex interventions including music and art therapy. nccih offers a range of funding opportunity announcements to support clinical trials of natural products and mind and body interventions. applicants are strongly encouraged to consult with the nccih scientific research contact prior to developing and submitting an application.areas of programmatic interest to nci include (but are not limited to) studies that:areas of programmatic interest to nhgri include but are not limited to:nhlbi provides global leadership for a research, research training, and education program to promote the prevention and treatment of heart, lung, blood, and sleep diseases and enhance the health of all individuals so that they can live longer and more fulfilling lives. the nhlbi encourages research designed to answer the breadth of scientific questions related to heart, lung, blood, and/or sleep diseases, disorders, and phenotypes. the nhlbi seeks research applications (r01 applications only) that will address questions relevant to the nhlbi mission, address gaps in the nhlbi’s portfolio of clinical and epidemiology cohort studies and should align with the nhlbi’s strategic vision. nhlbi’s strategic priorities emphasize the continuum of research from basic molecular biology research to implementation science related to heart, lung, blood, and sleep disorders (e.g., sickle cell disease and other hemoglobinopathies; cardiovascular diseases; hypertension prevention and control; asthma; chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (copd); sleep apnea; and other cardiopulmonary diseases and conditions), self-management of symptoms and disease conditions, and prevention of these diseases and disorders in various populations. the nhlbi also has significant interests in implementation science research for the prevention, control, and treatment of heart, lung, blood diseases, and sleep disorders, particularly research that addresses the development of interventions or strategies that address the translation of proven-effective, evidence-based interventions into clinical, community, and/or other settings; addresses impediments to uptake, scale up, and sustainability of evidence-based research. please refer to the nhlbi website for more details on the research priorities of the nhlbi: https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/about/documents/strategic-vision.nia is interested in research that can improve the understanding of aging processes and experiences that impact health and well-being in middle-aged and older sgm adults as well as studies focused on early life exposures that contribute to sgm health disparities in adulthood. nia encourages use of multi-level analysis of individual, dyadic, family, community/institution, and population data, and consideration of multidimensional measures of sexual orientation (identity, attraction, and behavior) and diverse gender categories. nia supports cross-national studies to better understand the aging experience on a global level and the effects of various policies. “natural experiments”, arising from policy change or regional differences, may provide another powerful approach for examining mechanisms affecting the health of sgm older adults. applicants are encouraged to leverage nia’s investment in data infrastructure and publicly available datasets. (see nia’s office of research resources.)areas of programmatic interest to nia include but are not limited to:niaaa seeks innovative applications in the areas of:areas of programmatic interest to niaid include but are not limited to:the mission of niams is to support research into the causes, treatment, and prevention of arthritis and musculoskeletal and skin diseases;
