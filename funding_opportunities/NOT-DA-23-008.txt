develop, and/or evaluate strategies to address challenges with recruiting, training, and retaining a robust and highly qualified behavioral health workforce. strategies explored through this initiative should focus on increasing recruitment and retention, improving provider training, reducing stigma among providers, increasing access to care and number of patients served, improving quality of care, and/or improving patient outcomes.backgroundthe nih heal initiative:this study is part of the nih’s helping to end addiction long-term (heal) initiative to speed scientific solutions to the national opioid public health crisis. the nih heal initiative bolsters research across nih to (1) improve treatment for opioid misuse and addiction and (2) enhance pain management. more information about the heal initiative is available at: https://heal.nih.gov/.this opportunity addresses a critical barrier to addressing the overdose crisis: ensuring a robust workforce to deliver interventions and services to people with substance use disorders and related comorbidities. recruiting, training, and retaining a robust and highly qualified behavioral health workforce is essential to delivering effective services that address opioid misuse and addiction. however, workforce shortages and high rates of turnover among behavioral health services staff and increases in demand for care have substantially impacted access to, cost of, and quality of services. further, these barriers undermine efforts to implement innovative approaches to care. in 2018, the health resources and services administration (hrsa) projected that demand for addiction counselors will exceed supply by approximately 38% in 2030; this trend has likely worsened in response to the covid-19 pandemic. workforce challenges were highlighted as one of the top priorities listed in the office of national drug control policy (ondcp) 2022 drug control strategy and an effective workforce undergirds all four elements (primary prevention, harm reduction, evidence-based treatment, recovery support) of the hhs overdose prevention strategy.there are numerous individual-, organizational-, and system-level challenges to recruiting, training, and retaining behavioral health professionals. unfortunately, little research has been conducted to develop and evaluate strategies to addressing these challenges. therefore, research funded through this initiative must focus on interventions or strategies aimed at addressing barriers to recruiting, training, and retaining a highly qualified behavioral health workforce, with the ultimate goal of improving care quality and patient outcomes for people who use drugs.for the purposes of this funding opportunity announcement (foa), the behavioral health workforce is defined as practitioners who deliver substance use and mental health treatment or prevention services or who play critical roles in connecting people who use drugs to services that can reduce their risk of overdose and death. this could include, but is not limited to: addiction counselors; mental health counselors; addiction medicine specialists; buprenorphine prescribers, including primary care physicians and nurse practitioners; social workers; peer recovery workers; harm reduction interventionists; prevention interventionist; etc.studies proposed for this foa may target individual-, organizational-, system- and macro-level dynamics, which include but are not limited to:individual-level dynamics: emotional stressors such as burnout, compassion fatigue, vicarious and secondary trauma, and feeling unqualified to provide effective treatmentorganizational-level dynamics: staffing shortages, leadership and clinical supervision, task-shifting, integration of peer interventionistssystem-level dynamics: low wages, reimbursement rates that are not on par with other medical services, billing constraints, limited resources to provide trainings for practitioners, shifts to telehealth during the covid-19 pandemic, x waiver requirements, licensure requirements, and scope of practice lawsmacro-level dynamics that cut across all levels of possible intervention: stigma toward individuals with substance use disorder, impacts of covid-19 on service providers, role of technology in service delivery, workforce diversity and relationship to disparities in care, geographic disparities in care access, interorganizational service linkages and relationships among practitionersby addressing these dynamics, studies should seek to improve recruitment, retention, or training of the behavioral health workforce in ways that translate to improved patient outcomes. examples of specific goals include, but are not limited to:increase the number of people recruited into the behavioral health workforceimprove retention in the behavioral health workforceimprove the training of people in the behavioral health workforce such that training is aligned with current evidence and reduces stigma toward people who use drugsimprove knowledge and expertise of and reduce stigma among practitioners working closely with the behavioral health workforceimprove availability and accessibility of behavioral health servicesimprove the quality of services deliveredincrease the number of people receiving servicesimprove patient outcomesstrategies can include practitioner-level interventions, organizational-level policy and practice changes, and existing, emerging, or potential system-wide policy changes. multi-method designs are encouraged (e.g., including survey or modeling work), but this opportunity is intended to encourage efforts to identify and intervene on modifiable factors that can improve workforce recruitment, training, and retention. examples of study designs include but are not limited to: efficacy and effectiveness trials, hybrid implementation-effectiveness trials, implementation trials, and natural experiments.additional considerations:in addition to assessing the impact of these strategies on recruitment, training and retention, applicants are encouraged to assess how these strategies impact care quality and patient outcomes, where relevant.applicants are strongly encouraged to take end-user perspectives into account where relevantof note, individuals from racial/ethnic minority groups are significantly underrepresented in the behavioral health workforce, and research has shown that patient-provider racial/ethnic concordance is associated with better outcomes. therefore, there is an important need to recruit and retain a behavioral health workforce that will better reflect the composition of treatment caseloads. ,applicants are strongly encouraged to ensure that their proposed research examines how practitioners (and potential practitioners) from diverse backgrounds would be impacted by the strategies being developed and explored through this initiative.applicants are strongly encouraged to focus on questions that can lead to more equitable care for minority health and nih-designated populations that experience health disparities see https://www.nimhd.nih.gov/about/strategic-plan/nih-strategic-plan-definitions-and-parameters.htmlapplicants to this program will be strongly encouraged to form multidisciplinary teams, including, for example, experts in organizational behavior or other disciplines who may be able to bring important transdisciplinary insights to this critical topic.applicants are encouraged to consider the sustainability and scalability of the strategies they are developing or testing, where relevant.national institute of mental healththe national institute of mental health (nimh) is interested in applications relevant to priorities described in this rfa, that support the nimh strategic plan for research goal #4, and that supports a workforce charged to deliver high quality care to people who have or are at risk for suds and who have co-morbid mental health conditions and/or suicide risk.topic of this research could include (but not be limited to):all applications that propose clinical trials should follow the nimh’s experimental therapeutics approach to intervention development and testing (seehttps://www.nimh.nih.gov/funding/opportunities-announcements/clinical-trials-foas/index.shtml). that is, the scope of work must include specification of targets/mechanisms and assessment of intervention induced changes in the presumed targets/mechanisms that are hypothesized to account for the intervention’s outcomes. in this manner, the results of the trial will advance knowledge regarding therapeutic change mechanisms and be informative regardless of trial outcomes (e.g., in the event of negative results, information about whether the intervention was successful at engaging its targets can facilitate interpretation).nimh is committed to supporting research that reduces disparities and advances equity in mental health interventions, services, and outcomes. accordingly, this foa encourages research studies that seek to reduce disparities for minority health and nih-designated populations that experience health disparities. see https://www.nimhd.nih.gov/about/strategic-plan/nih-strategic-plan-definitions-and-parameters.htmlnimh encourages a deployment-focused model of intervention and services design and evaluation that takes into account the perspective of relevant stakeholders (e.g., service users, providers, administrators, payers) and the key characteristics of the settings (e.g., resources, including workforce capacity; existing clinical workflows) that are intended to implement optimized mental health interventions. this attention to end-user perspectives and characteristics of intended clinical and/or community practice settings is intended to ensure the resultant interventions and service delivery strategies are acceptable to consumers and providers, the approaches are feasible and scalable in the settings where individuals are served, and the research results will have utility for end users.nimh encourages research on potentially scalable preventive, therapeutic, and services interventions that focuses on practice-relevant questions. accordingly, collaborations between academic researchers and clinical or community practice partners or networks are encouraged. when possible, studies should capitalize on existing infrastructure (e.g., practice-based research networks such as the nimh-sponsored mental health research network (mhrn), electronic medical records, administrative data bases, patient registries, institutions with clinical and translational science awards) to increase the efficiency of participant recruitment (i.e., more rapid identification and enrollment) and to facilitate the collection of moderator data (e.g., clinical characteristics, biomarkers), longer-term follow-up data, and broader, stakeholder-relevant outcomes (e.g., mental health and general health care utilization, value and efficiency of intervention approaches).application and submission informationthis notice applies to due dates on or after october 5, 2022 and subsequent receipt dates
