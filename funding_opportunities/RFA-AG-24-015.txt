administrative supplements to promote research continuity and retention of nih mentored career development (k) award recipients and scholarssee section iii. 3. additional information on eligibility.this funding opportunity announcement (foa) invites early-stage physicians and other health professional investigators with a commitment to aging and/or aging-related diseases to apply for this award with the goal of advancing their research and leadership skills in their specialty and in the broader field of aging and geriatrics research.the national institute on aging (nia) is pursuing this initiative to recruit early-stage investigators who have successfully competed for a research grant and begun to establish research programs and who, through this award, will be ready to assume leadership roles in their field of expertise and will be poised to change theory, practice, and health outcomes related to the health of older individuals. unlike other mentored k awards, candidates for this award must have received competitively awarded research support as a program director/principal investigator (pd/pi) at the faculty level or have otherwise leveraged faculty-level research support to develop an independent line of research. they must show evidence of leadership in the clinical or research domain.this foa is designed specifically for applicants proposing to serve as the lead investigator of an independent clinical trial, a clinical trial feasibility study, or a separate ancillary clinical trial as part of their research and career development. applicants not planning an independent clinical trial, or proposing to gain research experience in a clinical trial led by another investigator, must apply to the companion foa, rfa-ag-24-014.30 days before application due dateall applications are due by 5:00 pm local time of applicant organization.applications are encouraged to apply early to allow adequate time to make any corrections to errors found in the application during the submission process by the due date.no late applications will be accepted for this funding opportunity announcement.not applicableit is critical that applicants follow the instructions in the career development (k) instructions in the sf424 (r&r) application guide, except where instructed to do otherwise (in this foa or in a notice from the nih guide for grants and contracts). conformance to all requirements (both in the application guide and the foa) is required and strictly enforced. applicants must read and follow all application instructions in the application guide as well as any program-specific instructions noted in section iv. when the program-specific instructions deviate from those in the application guide, follow the program-specific instructions. applications that do not comply with these instructions may be delayed or not accepted for review.there are several options available to submit your application through grants.gov to nih and department of health and human services partners. you must use one of these submission options to access the application forms for this opportunity.the overall goal of the nih research career development program is to help ensure that a diverse pool of highly trained scientists is available in appropriate scientific disciplines to address the nation's biomedical, behavioral, and clinical research needs. nih institutes and centers (ics) support a variety of mentored and non-mentored career development award programs designed to foster the transition of new investigators to research independence and to support established investigators in achieving specific objectives. candidates should review the different career development (k) award programs to determine the best program to support their goals. more information about career programs may be found at the nih extramural training mechanisms website.the objective of the nih emerging leaders career development award (k76) is to help develop a cadre of scientists prepared to take an active leadership role in transformative change that will lead to improved research or healthcare outcomes. this program supports basic or clinically trained faculty members who seek additional research, professional career and leadership skills essential for assuming a leadership role in an increasingly global biomedical workforce. nih emerging leaders are early-stage investigators conducting research who have shown early signs of leadership and who will use this award to further develop the tools, skills and resources to have a significant impact as leaders in their field of expertise. these skills will prepare them to assume academic leadership roles and independent careers in an emerging discipline within their professional specialty.emerging leaders demonstrate a commitment to increasing the visibility and overall research support and academic capacity within their educational, medical/health, and/or research community. it is anticipated that their scientific expertise will be in demand as future reviewers, educators, and policymakers. within the field of aging research, the small numbers of individuals skilled in geriatrics, and the smaller numbers pursuing research on aging, are inadequate to address the burgeoning needs of the rapidly growing older population. a key goal of this initiative, therefore, is to foster the careers of emerging clinical investigators who possess the skills necessary for academic leadership in aging and geriatrics. unlike other mentored k award programs, this initiative aims to recruit investigators who have had competitively awarded research support at the faculty level and who have shown early signs of leadership in their field of expertise. although early-stage investigators, through their efforts, these individuals are well poised to change theory, practice, and outcomes related to the health of older individuals. through this announcement and the companion foa, emerging leaders will aim to capitalize on current opportunities in clinical, translational, or groundbreaking basic research in aging and geriatrics to advance an emerging discipline or effect changes in practice within their professional specialty.through the nih emerging leaders career development award, investigators are provided salary and research support for a sustained period of "protected time" (3-5 years) for career development and to advance the leadership skills of physician-investigators and other investigators trained in health professions. these investigators conduct research in basic, translational or clinical, and patient-oriented research (por) in disciplines relevant to aging and geriatrics.the award is intended to prepare early-stage investigators for academic research leadership, as well as provide mentoring in their scientific research area of interest. the focus is on building a cadre of investigators and leaders to advance knowledge and skills in a new field, a new methodology, or a new approach, both through their own research and through their leadership, in the broader community of their specialty.through this foa, nia uses the nih emerging leaders career development award to administer the paul b. beeson emerging leaders career development award in aging program. the program is named after dr. paul b. beeson, who profoundly influenced the career paths of many physicians, including several who now form the core leadership in geriatric medicine. dr. beeson was chairman of medicine at emory and yale medical schools, nuffield professor at oxford university, and professor and distinguished va physician at the university of washington. he chaired the first institute of medicine study on "aging and medical education" in 1978. his leadership as an editor of the cecil textbook of medicine greatly influenced medical education. from his research and patient care base, he grew increasingly interested in the process of aging, and this interest led to a commitment that included his editorship of the journal of the american geriatrics society.the aims of the program are as follows:this foa provides an opportunity for candidates to expand their research area of interest and pursue activities consistent with the expectation of future leadership in the candidate's chosen field.nia welcomes applications in all fields of aging research, including basic, translational, genetic, biological, neuroscientific, clinical, behavioral, and social sciences research on aging. a particular priority of nia at the moment is research on alzheimer's disease (ad) and alzheimer's disease-related dementias (adrd).this initiative is targeted primarily towards individuals who have had prior training in research coursework, methods, and resources related to aging, and who have received initial funding for research, such as through small grant support from nih, similar support from other federal agencies, or foundation funding. the award(s) should have been competitively awarded to the candidate at the faculty level. individuals who have leveraged faculty-level research development support to advance and develop an independent line of research and who can provide evidence that they possess the attributes of committed and skilled leaders in their respective fields are also welcome to apply.prior evidence of leadership can be in either clinical duties or research activities that illustrate keen engagement and commitment to moving the applicant's field forward. examples include organizing seminar series, conferences or symposia at a national meeting; organizing workshops; or other activities where the candidates have played a leading role in enhancing their fields' academic medical/health and research accomplishments and visibility.the proposed career development and research should focus on aging or older adults. for this foa, the candidate's project may be in any of a broad range of basic, translational, behavioral, clinical, or por areas relevant to aging. the full range of research methods appropriate to completing the proposed investigation is encouraged, including basic and translational research and cell or computational models, provided that the application makes clear the eventual clinical relevance of the proposed work. we expect that scholars will contribute significantly to the research and scientific literature associated with the field of aging research.mentorship - candidates must identify mentors who are senior researchers in aging and/or age-related diseases and conditions, and who agree to commit time to supervise and guide the candidate during the period of the award. a part of that commitment is the intent to advance the candidate both as a researcher and as an emerging leader in the field.annual meetings - a central part of this award is an annual meeting for beeson scholars and their mentors. accordingly, awardees must attend the annual meeting. annual meetings are a valuable forum for scientific and professional networking opportunities for current beeson awardees, beeson alumni, and mentors. the meetings are intended to spark collaboration and expose scholars to a wide range of exciting science on aging.this foa is designed specifically for candidates proposing to serve as the lead investigator of an independent clinical trial, a clinical trial feasibility study, or a separate ancillary clinical trial, as part of their research and career development. those not planning an independent clinical trial, or proposing to gain research experience in a clinical trial led by another investigator, must apply to the companion foa, rfa-ag-24-014.nih defines a clinical trial as "a research study in which one or more human subjects are prospectively assigned to one or more interventions (which may include placebo or other control) to evaluate the effects of those interventions on health-related biomedical or behavioral outcomes." (not-od-15-015).nih not only supports trials of safety and efficacy, it also supports mechanistic exploratory studies that meet the definition of a clinical trial and are designed to explore or understand a biological or behavioral process, the pathophysiology of a disease, or the mechanism of action of an intervention. these studies may focus on basic and/or translational discovery research in healthy human subjects and in human subjects who are affected by the pathophysiology of diseases and disorders. by addressing basic questions and concepts in biology, behavior, and pathophysiology, these studies may provide insight into understanding human diseases and disorders along with potential treatments or preventive strategies. nih also supports biomarker studies that meet the definition of a clinical trial and that may provide information about physiological function, target engagement of novel therapeutics, and/or the impact of therapeutics on treatment response. nih thus supports studies that meet the definition of clinical trials (as noted above) but do not seek to establish safety, clinical efficacy, effectiveness, clinical management, and/or implementation of preventive, therapeutic, and services interventions.investigators proposing nih-defined clinical trials may refer to the research methods resources website for information about developing statistical methods and study designs.clinical research operations management systemnia supports a central resource to nia staff and extramural investigators to facilitate/support the conduct and management of clinical research. this resource, the clinical research operations management system (croms), is a comprehensive data management system to support the business functions, management, and oversight responsibilities of nia grants that support the conduct of clinical research with human subjects. it is the expectation by nia that all successful applicants will interface, integrate, or adapt their information system(s) and processes to interact with existing and future components of the croms as necessary, including the use of croms data templates as specified.see section viii. other information for award authorities and regulations.grant: a support mechanism providing money, property, or both to an eligible entity to carry out an approved project or activity.resubmission of applications from rfa-ag-20-021required: only accepting applications that propose an independent clinical trial(s).nia intends to commit $2 million in fy 2024 and 2025 to fund approximately 7 to 10 awards each year from this foa and its companion, rfa-ag-24-014. future year amounts are contingent upon annual appropriations.award budgets are composed of salary and other program-related expenses, as described below. award budgets are limited to $225,000 in direct costs in any year.the total project period may not exceed 5 years.nih will contribute up to the legislative limit per year toward the salary of the career award recipient. further guidance on budgeting for career development salaries is provided in the sf424 (r&r) application guide. salary must be within the overall direct cost limit of $225,000 (see also not-od-17-094).the total nih contribution to salary, however, may not exceed the legislatively mandated salary cap.nih will contribute support up to the overall direct cost limit per year toward the research development costs of the award recipient, which must be justified and consistent with the stage of development of the candidate and the proportion of time to be spent in research or career development activities. these funds may be used for the following expenses:it is expected that awardees will use a portion of their research development funds to cover the costs of traveling to an annual domestic meeting for beeson scholars.salaries for mentors, secretarial and administrative assistants, etc. are not allowed.1. eligible applicantshigher education institutionsthe following types of higher education institutions are always encouraged to apply for nih support as public or private institutions of higher education:nonprofits other than institutions

including but not limited to phd, md, do, dds, dmd, od, dc, pharmd, doctor of naturopathy (nd), and dvm.2. cost sharing3. additional information on eligibilityapplicant organizations may submit more than one application, provided that each application is scientifically distinct, and each is from a different candidate.the nih will not accept duplicate or highly overlapping applications under review at the same time per 2.3.7.4 submission of resubmission application. an individual may not have two or more competing nih career development applications pending review concurrently. in addition, nih will not accept:candidates may submit research project grant (rpg) applications concurrently with the k application. however, any concurrent rpg application may not have substantial scientific and/or budgetary overlap with the career award application. k award recipients are encouraged to obtain funding from nih or other federal sources, either as a pd/pi on a competing research grant award or cooperative agreement, or as project leader on a competing multi-project award as described in not-od-08-065.at the time of award, the candidate must have a “full-time” appointment at the academic institution. candidates are required to commit a minimum of 75% of full-time professional effort (i.e., a minimum of 9 person-months) to their program of career development. candidates may engage in other duties as part of the remaining 25% of their full-time professional effort not covered by this award, as long as such duties do not interfere with or detract from the proposed career development program.candidates who have va appointments may not consider part of the va effort toward satisfying the full time requirement at the applicant institution. candidates with va appointments should contact the staff person in the relevant institute or center prior to preparing an application to discuss their eligibility.after the receipt of the award, adjustments to the required level of effort may be made in certain circumstances. see not-od-18-156 and nih grants policy statement, section 12.3.6.4 temporary adjustments to the percent effort requirement for more details.before submitting the application, the candidate must identify a mentor who will supervise the proposed career development and research experience. the mentor should be an active investigator in the area of the proposed research and be committed both to the career development of the candidate and to the direct supervision of the candidate’s research. the mentor must document the availability of sufficient research support and facilities for high-quality research. candidates are encouraged to identify more than one mentor, i.e., a mentoring team, if this is deemed advantageous

to the nih in support of the nih mission are evaluated for scientific and technical merit through the nih peer review system.for this particular announcement, note the following:reviewers should evaluate the candidate’s potential for developing an independent research program that will make important contributions to the field, taking into consideration the years of research experience and the likely value of the proposed research career development as a vehicle for developing a successful, independent research program.overall impactreviewers should provide their assessment of the likelihood that the proposed career development and research plan will enhance the candidate’s potential for a productive, independent scientific research career in a health-related field, taking into consideration the criteria below in determining the overall impact score.reviewers will consider each of the review criteria below in the determination of scientific merit, and give a separate score for each. an application does not need to be strong in all categories to be judged likely to have major scientific impact.the reviewers will consider that the clinical trial may include study design, methods, and intervention that are not by themselves innovative, but address important questions or unmet needs. reviewers should also consider the scope of the clinical trial relative to the available resources, including the possibility that research support provided through career development awards may be sufficient to support only small feasibility studies.candidatecareer development plan/career goals and objectivesstudy timeline for clinical trialsis the study timeline described in detail, taking into account start-up activities, the anticipated rate of enrollment, and planned follow-up assessment? is the projected timeline feasible and well justified? does the project incorporate efficiencies and utilize existing resources (e.g., ctsas, practice-based research networks, electronic medical records, administrative database, or patient registries) to increase the efficiency of participant enrollment and data collection, as appropriate?are potential challenges and corresponding solutions discussed (e.g., strategies that can be implemented in the event of enrollment shortfalls)?protections for human subjectsfor research that involves human subjects but does not involve one of the categories of research that are exempt under 45 cfr part 46, the committee will evaluate the justification for involvement of human subjects and the proposed protections from research risk relating to their participation according to the following five review criteria: 1) risk to subjects, 2) adequacy of protection against risks, 3) potential benefits to the subjects and others, 4) importance of the knowledge to be gained, and 5) data and safety monitoring for clinical trials.for research that involves human subjects and meets the criteria for one or more of the categories of research that are exempt under 45 cfr part 46, the committee will evaluate: 1) the justification for the exemption, 2) human subjects involvement and characteristics, and 3) sources of materials. for additional information on review of the human subjects section, please refer to the guidelines for the review of human subjects.inclusion of women, minorities, and individuals across the lifespanwhen the proposed project involves human subjects and/or nih-defined clinical research, the committee will evaluate the proposed plans for the inclusion (or exclusion) of individuals on the basis of sex/gender, race, and ethnicity, as well as the inclusion (or exclusion) of individuals of all ages (including children and older adults) to determine if it is justified in terms of the scientific goals and research strategy proposed. for additional information on review of the inclusion section, please refer to the guidelines for the review of inclusion in clinical research.vertebrate animalsthe committee will evaluate the involvement of live vertebrate animals as part of the scientific assessment according to the following criteria: (1) description of proposed procedures involving animals, including species, strains, ages, sex, and total number to be used; (2) justifications for the use of animals versus alternative models and for the appropriateness of the species proposed; (3) interventions to minimize discomfort, distress, pain and injury; and (4) justification for euthanasia method if not consistent with the avma guidelines for the euthanasia of animals. reviewers will assess the use of chimpanzees as they would any other application proposing the use of vertebrate animals. for additional information on review of the vertebrate animals section, please refer to the worksheet for review of the vertebrate animals section.biohazardsreviewers will assess whether materials or procedures proposed are potentially hazardous to research personnel and/or the environment, and if needed, determine whether adequate protection is proposed.resubmissionsfor resubmissions, the committee will evaluate the application as now presented, taking into consideration the responses to comments from the previous scientific review group and changes made to the project.revisionsnot applicableas applicable for the project proposed, reviewers will consider each of the following items, but will not give scores for these items, and should not consider them in providing an overall impact score.resource sharing plansreviewers will comment on whether the resource sharing plan(s) (i.e., sharing model organisms) or the rationale for not sharing the resources, is reasonable.training in the responsible conduct of researchall applications for support under this foa must include a plan to fulfill nih requirements for instruction in the responsible conduct of research (rcr). taking into account the level of experience of the candidate, including any prior instruction or participation in rcr as appropriate for the candidate’s career stage, the reviewers will evaluate the adequacy of the proposed rcr training in relation to the following five required components: 1) format - the required format of instruction, i.e., face-to-face lectures, coursework, and/or real-time discussion groups (a plan with only on-line instruction is
