submission options to access the application forms for this opportunity.the overall goal of the nih research career development program is to help ensure that a diverse pool of highly trained scientists is available in appropriate scientific disciplines to address the nation's biomedical, behavioral, and clinical research needs. nih institutes and centers (ics) support a variety of mentored and non-mentored career development award programs designed to foster the transition of new investigators to research independence and to support established investigators in achieving specific objectives. candidates should review the different career development (k) award programs to determine the best program to support their goals. more information about career programs may be found at the nih extramural training mechanisms website.the goal of this ninds k22 program is to foster the integration of highly skilled, nih-trained neurologists and neurosurgeons into the pool of clinicians-scientists conducting neuroscience research at institutions across the country. this funding opportunity is available to licensed neurologists and neurosurgeons in the ninds intramural program who are within 4 years of completion of residency or clinical fellowship. for this 5-year award, awardees may spend up to 2 years in the intramural phase, with the balance (3 years or more) in the extramural phase. the entire award is intended to be mentored, but a transition to independence is strongly encouraged during the extramural phase of the award (see: transition to the extramural phase in section vi of this foa). in order to transition to the extramural phase, awardees must obtain a faculty position at an academic institution that will provide a minimum of 9 person-months (75% of full-time professional effort) to neurologists, 6 person-months (50% full time professional effort) for neurosurgeons that is entirely dedicated to research. in addition, the institution must provide access to the resources, and have appropriate mentor(s), needed for completion of the k award research project and development of a strong application for an nih r01 or equivalent. this position should either be a tenure-track position, or an equivalent, secure faculty position, which includes a strong institutional commitment that will facilitate progress towards a successful dual career as clinician and research scientist. in order to obtain the 5th year of k22 funding, awardees must submit an nih r01, dp1 or r21 application, as pd/pi, by the end of the 4th year of the k22 award.this foa is intended to facilitate the transition of ninds intramural clinician-scientists to independent, academic faculty positions that support clinician-scientists to engage in independently funded scientific research as well as clinical activities. as such, awardees should develop, with their mentors, a comprehensive, coherent career development program to achieve the knowledge and skills required to succeed in such a position. applicants should have a well-conceived research plan that investigates a highly significant scientific problem within the ninds mission. the proposed initial phase of the research to be conducted at the nih intramural program should be designed to continue at an extramural academic institution during the second phase of the research. projects that require special resources available only at the nih intramural program are acceptable if 1) collaborative efforts with nih staff can be maintained, 2) it is clearly feasible to continue timely research activity that requires these resources, and 3) collaborators and the ninds scientific director commit to the continued collaboration. in addition, regardless of whether special nih resources are necessary for conduct of the project in phase ii, a significant component of the proposed project must belong to the applicant, such that he/she can pursue the project in phase ii without competition from the mentor(s) at nih.in addition to the specific research plan, applicants should develop a plan to obtain the skills and experiences that facilitate a successful, independent research career. skills should include grant-writing and oral presentation skills, specialized coursework if needed, and strong expertise in experimental design and statistical methodology. regardless of the research question or approach, applicants should obtain a fundamental understanding of the requirements for experimental rigor (see, for example, not-ns-11-023 and the related ninds transparency in reporting guidance) and build such rigorous processes into their research project. experiences might include networking with key researchers in their field, both nationally and internationally, attendance at workshops designed to enhance specialized knowledge and skills, and presentations at national and international meetings. applicants should also receive guidance on administrative skills associated with an independent research career in an extramural institution, which may include, as applicable, managing a laboratory, managing a budget, managing personnel, recruitment of human subjects, organizing multiple sites for clinical research activities, etc.as this is a mentored, career-development award, applicants should have one or more mentors who will fulfill all of the applicant's career development needs. mentors are expected to contribute to the successful completion of all career development components, as well as provide guidance on choosing, and negotiating for, an appropriate extramural position.note: this funding opportunity announcement (foa) is designed specifically for applicants proposing research that does not involve leading an independent clinical trial, a clinical trial feasibility study, or an ancillary clinical trial. applicants to this foa are permitted to propose research experience in a clinical trial led by a mentor or co-mentor. applicants proposing a clinical trial or an ancillary study to an ongoing clinical trial as lead investigator, should apply to the companion foa pa-21-327. applicants to this foa are permitted to propose research experience in a clinical trial led by a mentor or co-mentor.nih defines a clinical trial as "a research study in which one or more human subjects are prospectively assigned to one or more interventions (which may include placebo or other control) to evaluate the effects of those interventions on health-related biomedical or behavioral outcomes." (not-od-15-015).nih not only supports trials of safety and efficacy, it also supports mechanistic exploratory studies that meet the definition of a clinical trial and are designed to explore or understand a biological or behavioral process, the pathophysiology of a disease, or the mechanism of action of an intervention. these studies may focus on basic and/or translational discovery research in healthy human subjects and in human subjects who are affected by the pathophysiology of diseases and disorders. by addressing basic questions and concepts in biology, behavior, and pathophysiology, these studies may provide insight into understanding human diseases and disorders along with potential treatments or preventive strategies. nih also supports biomarker studies that meet the definition of a clinical trial and that may provide information about physiological function, target engagement of novel therapeutics, and/or the impact of therapeutics on treatment response. nih thus supports studies that meet the definition of clinical trials (as noted above) but do not seek to establish safety, clinical efficacy, effectiveness, clinical management, and/or implementation of preventive, therapeutic, and services interventions.see section viii. other information for award authorities and regulations.grant: a support mechanism providing money, property, or both to an eligible entity to carry out an approved project or activity.the oer glossary and the sf424 (r&r) application guide provide details on these application types.not allowed: only accepting applications that do not propose

are warranted where nondiscriminatory justifications establish that such criteria are appropriate with respect to the health or safety of the subjects, the scientific study design, or the purpose of the research. for additional guidance regarding how the provisions apply to nih grant programs, please contact the scientific/research contact that is identified in section vii under agency contacts of this foa.please contact the hhs office for civil rights for more information about obligations and prohibitions under federal civil rights laws at

defense authorization act of fiscal year 2009 (public law 110-417), nih awards will be subject to thefederal awardee performance and integrity information system (fapiis) requirements. fapiis requires federal award making officials to review and consider information about an applicant in the designated integrity and performance system (currently fapiis) prior to making an award. an applicant, at its option, may review information in the designated integrity and performance systems accessible through fapiis and comment on any information about itself that a federal agency previously entered and is currently in fapiis. the federal awarding agency will consider any comments by the applicant, in addition to other information in fapiis, in making a judgement about the applicant’s integrity, business ethics, and record of performance under federal awards when completing the review of risk posed by applicants as described in 45 cfr part 75.205 and 2 cfr part 200.206 “federal awarding agency review of risk posed by applicants.” this provision will apply to all nih grants and cooperative agreements except fellowships.transition to the independent phasetransition from the intramural phase to the extramural phase is not automatic, and requires administrative approval by ninds extramural program staff. approval of the transition will be based on several factors. the awardee's progress during the intramural phase will be determined from a progress report included in the request to transfer the award (see below). the awardee's research and career development plans for the extramural phase, included in the request to transfer the award, will be evaluated in light of the progress already made. the sponsoring institution must provide either a tenure-track or equivalent position, or a faculty position with a strong institutional commitment to facilitate progress towards a successful dual career as a clinician and research scientist in a secure faculty position. the sponsoring institution must provide a minimum protected time for research of nine person-months (75% full time professional effort) for neurologists, six person-months (50% full time professional effort) for neurosurgeons (as in the initial application, the extramural institution must provide a detailed explanation of the non-research responsibilities, and the time required for them, that leads to the calculation of protected time). the institution must also provide the space and resources needed to conduct the proposed research project, as well as a description of startup funds provided. careful attention should be paid to appropriate mentoring at the extramural institution. the extramural institution should have an appropriate scientific mentor for the project, and the candidate should include any additional mentors required for comprehensive guidance in the candidate's career path. it is essential that the request to transition include a plan for career development that will lead to research independence, the ability to successfully compete for research support, and a commitment from the extramural mentor and institution to support the candidate's progress towards a successful research program and independent funding. ninds must have appropriate documentation no later than two months before the end of the intramural phase (e.g. no later than two months before the end of the 2nd year of the k22 award) in order to avoid a potential interruption in funding. except in rare, extenuating circumstances, if the awardee does not secure an extramural position by the end of the 2nd year of the k22 award, the k22 award will be terminated.the application for the extramural phase of the award must be submitted no later than 2 months prior to the proposed activation date of the award by extramural grantee organization. however, to avoid potential problems in activation, applicants are strongly encouraged to contact the director, office of training, career development and workforce diversity, ninds as soon as plans to assume an extramural position develop, and not later than 6 months prior to the end of the intramural phase of the award, to discuss plans for transition to, and the application for, the extramural phase.an eligible extramural institution for this k22 must have the appropriate infrastructure to support the proposed research program and a history of external research funding.candidates must provide a progress report using form phs 2590, which should detail progress achieved on the specific aims of the research plan and on the pursuit of identified career and career development goals. future goals for the research project and for further career development should also be indicated. the mentor must provide a separate narrative of the research and career development of the candidate.form phs 2590 must include the following:the extramural institution must provide the space, facilities, resources, and other support needed to conduct the proposed research, as well as the required protected research time for neurologists and neurosurgeons, at least for the duration of the k22 award. any start-up package and other institutional support must be described in detail and must be comparable to that given to other faculty recently hired into the equivalent faculty position. the k22 sponsoring institution must describe the candidate's academic appointment. the k22 institution must describe the awardee's ability to apply for and secure independent research grants, including an nih rpg or equivalent.these materials should be sent, via an email attachment (preferably pdf format), directly to both the scientific contact and grants management contact listed below.an institutional commitment agreement will be required at the time of activation of the extramural phase of the award. this agreement should satisfy the criteria described in the career development award section of the sf424 application guide.the k22 award is intended to facilitate successful transition to an independent dual, clinician-scientist career. moreover, funding of the 5th year of the k22 award requires the candidate to submit a competitive nih r01 or r21 application by the end of the 4th year of the k22. consequently, a requirement for approval of the transfer of the k22 to the extramural institution is the commitment of the extramural institution, including the provision of adequate resources, for successful progress of the candidate to research independence.candidates for whom transfer to the extramural institution is not approved will receive written notification from the awarding component, communicating the rationale for the disapproval. this notification typically will be sent within 60 days of receipt of the transfer application.although the financial plans of the nih institute or center provide support for this program, awards pursuant to this funding opportunity are contingent upon the availability of funds.data management and sharingnote: the nih policy for data management and sharing is effective for due dates on or after january 25, 2023.consistent with the nih policy
