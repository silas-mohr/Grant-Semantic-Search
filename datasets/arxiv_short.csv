"C. Bal\'azs, E. L. Berger, P. M. Nadolsky, C.-P. Yuan","Calculation of prompt diphoton production cross sections at Tevatron and
  LHC energies","  A fully differential calculation in perturbative quantum chromodynamics is
presented for the production of massive photon pairs at hadron colliders. All
next-to-leading order perturbative contributions from quark-antiquark,
gluon-(anti)quark, and gluon-gluon subprocesses are included, as well as
all-orders resummation of initial-state gluon radiation valid at
next-to-next-to-leading logarithmic accuracy. The region of phase space is
specified in which the calculation is most reliable. Good agreement is
demonstrated with data from the Fermilab Tevatron, and predictions are made for
more detailed tests with CDF and DO data. Predictions are shown for
distributions of diphoton pairs produced at the energy of the Large Hadron
Collider (LHC). Distributions of the diphoton pairs from the decay of a Higgs
boson are contrasted with those produced from QCD processes at the LHC, showing
that enhanced sensitivity to the signal can be obtained with judicious
selection of events.

Ileana Streinu and Louis Theran,Sparsity-certifying Graph Decompositions,"  We describe a new algorithm, the $(k,\ell)$-pebble game with colors, and use
it obtain a characterization of the family of $(k,\ell)$-sparse graphs and
algorithmic solutions to a family of problems concerning tree decompositions of
graphs. Special instances of sparse graphs appear in rigidity theory and have
received increased attention in recent years. In particular, our colored
pebbles generalize and strengthen the previous results of Lee and Streinu and
give a new proof of the Tutte-Nash-Williams characterization of arboricity. We
also present a new decomposition that certifies sparsity based on the
$(k,\ell)$-pebble game with colors. Our work also exposes connections between
pebble game algorithms and previous sparse graph algorithms by Gabow, Gabow and
Westermann and Hendrickson.

Hongjun Pan,"The evolution of the Earth-Moon system based on the dark matter field
  fluid model","  The evolution of Earth-Moon system is described by the dark matter field
fluid model proposed in the Meeting of Division of Particle and Field 2004,
American Physical Society. The current behavior of the Earth-Moon system agrees
with this model very well and the general pattern of the evolution of the
Moon-Earth system described by this model agrees with geological and fossil
evidence. The closest distance of the Moon to Earth was about 259000 km at 4.5
billion years ago, which is far beyond the Roche's limit. The result suggests
that the tidal friction may not be the primary cause for the evolution of the
Earth-Moon system. The average dark matter field fluid constant derived from
Earth-Moon system data is 4.39 x 10^(-22) s^(-1)m^(-1). This model predicts
that the Mars's rotation is also slowing with the angular acceleration rate
about -4.38 x 10^(-22) rad s^(-2).

David Callan,"A determinant of Stirling cycle numbers counts unlabeled acyclic
  single-source automata","  We show that a determinant of Stirling cycle numbers counts unlabeled acyclic
single-source automata. The proof involves a bijection from these automata to
certain marked lattice paths and a sign-reversing involution to evaluate the
determinant.

Wael Abu-Shammala and Alberto Torchinsky,From dyadic $\Lambda_{\alpha}$ to $\Lambda_{\alpha}$,"  In this paper we show how to compute the $\Lambda_{\alpha}$ norm, $\alpha\ge
0$, using the dyadic grid. This result is a consequence of the description of
the Hardy spaces $H^p(R^N)$ in terms of dyadic and special atoms.

Y. H. Pong and C. K. Law,Bosonic characters of atomic Cooper pairs across resonance,"  We study the two-particle wave function of paired atoms in a Fermi gas with
tunable interaction strengths controlled by Feshbach resonance. The Cooper pair
wave function is examined for its bosonic characters, which is quantified by
the correction of Bose enhancement factor associated with the creation and
annihilation composite particle operators. An example is given for a
three-dimensional uniform gas. Two definitions of Cooper pair wave function are
examined. One of which is chosen to reflect the off-diagonal long range order
(ODLRO). Another one corresponds to a pair projection of a BCS state. On the
side with negative scattering length, we found that paired atoms described by
ODLRO are more bosonic than the pair projected definition. It is also found
that at $(k_F a)^{-1} \ge 1$, both definitions give similar results, where more
than 90% of the atoms occupy the corresponding molecular condensates.

"Alejandro Corichi, Tatjana Vukasinac and Jose A. Zapata",Polymer Quantum Mechanics and its Continuum Limit,"  A rather non-standard quantum representation of the canonical commutation
relations of quantum mechanics systems, known as the polymer representation has
gained some attention in recent years, due to its possible relation with Planck
scale physics. In particular, this approach has been followed in a symmetric
sector of loop quantum gravity known as loop quantum cosmology. Here we explore
different aspects of the relation between the ordinary Schroedinger theory and
the polymer description. The paper has two parts. In the first one, we derive
the polymer quantum mechanics starting from the ordinary Schroedinger theory
and show that the polymer description arises as an appropriate limit. In the
second part we consider the continuum limit of this theory, namely, the reverse
process in which one starts from the discrete theory and tries to recover back
the ordinary Schroedinger quantum mechanics. We consider several examples of
interest, including the harmonic oscillator, the free particle and a simple
cosmological model.

Damian C. Swift,"Numerical solution of shock and ramp compression for general material
  properties","  A general formulation was developed to represent material models for
applications in dynamic loading. Numerical methods were devised to calculate
response to shock and ramp compression, and ramp decompression, generalizing
previous solutions for scalar equations of state. The numerical methods were
found to be flexible and robust, and matched analytic results to a high
accuracy. The basic ramp and shock solution methods were coupled to solve for
composite deformation paths, such as shock-induced impacts, and shock
interactions with a planar interface between different materials. These
calculations capture much of the physics of typical material dynamics
experiments, without requiring spatially-resolving simulations. Example
calculations were made of loading histories in metals, illustrating the effects
of plastic work on the temperatures induced in quasi-isentropic and
shock-release experiments, and the effect of a phase transition.
